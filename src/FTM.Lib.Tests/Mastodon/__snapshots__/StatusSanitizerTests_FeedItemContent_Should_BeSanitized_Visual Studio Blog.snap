It leverage MSVC&#8217;s trace capture technology and uses the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/event-tracing-for-windows--etw-\">Windows </a><a id=\"post-253442-_Int_xZ6H58Ne\"></a><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/event-tracing-for-windows--etw-\">ETW</a> framework to collect detailed information about every build event, such as compilation, linking, code analysis, and more. You can then view and analyze this data in many ways, such as a timeline, a <a id=\"post-253442-_Int_3iP4Rgv0\"></a>flame graph, or a tree map. As of Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7, C++ Build Insights is <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/build-insights-now-available-in-visual-studio-2022/\">integrated into Visual Studio</a>.</p>\n<p>C++ Build Insights can help you identify and fix bottlenecks, dependencies, and inefficiencies in your build system, resulting in faster and more reliable builds. You can also compare different builds and see how your changes affect the build performance over time. To learn more, read how <a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-build-insights-call-of-duty-modern-warfare/\">Activision used Build Insights to cut Call of Duty’s Build Time by 50%</a> on the Microsoft Game Dev Blog.</p>\n<h2>How to Filter C++ Build Insights by Project</h2>\n<p>One of the new features in Visual Studio 2022 is the ability to filter your C++ Build Insights results for Visual Studio solutions by project. This can be particularly useful if you have a large solution with multiple projects and you want to focus on one of them. To do this, simply run Build Insights on your solution by selecting <strong>Build &gt; Run Build Insights on Solution</strong> and then either <strong>Build </strong>or <strong>Rebuild,</strong> depending on whether you want to measure the build from scratch. This will generate an ETL (event trace log) trace, which Visual Studio will automatically open to visualize the data collected. Select the project that you want to filter by selecting the funnel next to the <em>Project</em> column and narrowing down the set of projects for which you want to view the data.</p>\n<h2>How to Filter C++ Build Insights by File Paths</h2>\n<p>In addition to project filtering, Build Insights now also supports file path filtering, which gives you fine-grained control over which files are included in your analysis. This is especially helpful in large codebases where build data from third-party libraries or generated code can clutter your view. With the File Path Filter, you can use glob patterns to focus on specific directories or file types—helping you isolate and investigate the build performance of just the parts you care about. Whether you’re narrowing your focus during a regression investigation or simply trying to understand the build cost of a particular code change, file path filtering helps you get answers faster.</p>\n<p>To do this, simply run Build Insights on your solution by selecting <strong>Build &gt; Run Build Insights on Solution</strong> and then either <strong>Build </strong>or <strong>Rebuild,</strong> depending on whether you want to measure the build from scratch.

    "sanitized": "When we launched the Cloud Academy benefit for Visual Studio Professional and Enterprise subscribers back in March 2025, our goal was simple: give you the hands-on, practical learning experience you need to confidently master Azure and cloud technologies — without spending a dime beyond your subscription.\nWhy? Because in today’s fast-changing tech world, knowing theory isn’t enough. You need to do — to experiment, build, troubleshoot, and grow your skills in a real environment. That’s exactly what Cloud Academy delivers.\n\nFrom Frustration to Confidence: Learning That Fits Your Style\nIf you’re like many developers I’ve talked to, finding time to build new skills feels like a constant struggle. Between deadlines, meetings, and firefighting production issues, carving out space to learn something new is tough.\nCloud Academy understands that. Whether you’re the type who likes step-by-step guided labs, jumping straight into hands-on challenges, or tinkering freely in a safe sandbox, this platform adapts to how you learn best.\nThe result? Visual Studio subscribers are completing labs at a rate 10% higher than other learners on Cloud Academy. That means you’re not just skimming content — you’re gaining meaningful, practical skills that stick.\nWhat’s New? Fresh Content Tailored for Today’s Cloud Challenges\nCloud technology evolves rapidly, and staying ahead means keeping your skills sharp. We’ve added new lessons and labs to make sure you’re ready to tackle the latest Azure capabilities and security challenges, including:\n\nAutomate document processing with Azure AI Document Intelligence Studio — no coding needed, just real impact.\nStrengthen endpoint security with Microsoft Entra ID’s automated password management — because security can’t be an afterthought.\nStreamline device management with Intune device naming templates — save time and reduce errors.\nDive into Azure OpenAI Service’s prompt engineering — build AI apps that behave reliably.\n…and much more that matches what companies are demanding now.\n\nHands-On Labs: Where Real Learning Happens\nReading about cloud services is one thing. Building and deploying containerized apps, automating workflows, or managing state in Azure Container Apps — that’s where the real transformation happens.\nCloud Academy’s labs let you roll up your sleeves in real Azure environments, so you:\n\nPush container images and manage registries.\nAutomate file processing with Azure Functions.\nExplore state management with Dapr in container apps.\n\nThis kind of hands-on experience turns concepts into capabilities, making you more valuable to your team and your company.\nCertification Prep That Works\nMany subscribers are also using Cloud Academy to prep for Microsoft certifications, which are a powerful way to validate your skills and open doors in your career.

We have also launched a new video series on Visual Studio Toolbox to provide a more detailed tour of our samples. Check out the series <a href=\"https://aka.ms/vsextensibilityseries\">here</a>!</p>\n<h2>What’s new for VisualStudio.Extensibility for 17.14?</h2>\n<p>Our 17.14 release of VisualStudio.Extensibility includes the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Text classification support</li>\n<li>Updates to the ShowPromptAsync API</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This release also includes a previously <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visualstudio-extensibility-managing-net-runtime-versions/\">mentioned</a> change regarding .NET runtime management requirements. VisualStudio.Extensibility extensions are executed on a separate .NET runtime host, unlike VSSDK extensions which run in the same process as devenv.exe, using the .NET Framework runtime. Since VisualStudio.Extensibility extensions operate on .NET, we must adhere to the runtime servicing lifetime of .NET. Consequently, the VisualStudio.Extensibility platform will be regularly updated to advance to newer versions of .NET LTS.

This enhancement laid the groundwork for the text classification feature we are introducing in 17.14. Text classification facilitates custom text coloring within an opened file, commonly referred to as semantic and syntactic colorization. The following snippet demonstrates the creation of classification tags, which are fundamental to implementing editor classification. Please note that the example provided is a very simplistic approach and should not be used without further refinement.

    "sanitized": "We continue to invest in the VisualStudio.Extensibility SDK to allow users like you to create extensions that run faster and smoother than ever before! VisualStudio.Extensibility helps you build extensions that run outside the main Visual Studio IDE process for improved performance, reliability, and installation without restarting Visual Studio. Additional benefits include a sleek and intuitive .NET 8-based API and comprehensive, well-maintained documentation to help you develop amazing extensions faster than ever before.\nGet Started with VisualStudio.Extensibility\nFor the latest up-to-date docs and installation instructions, visit https://aka.ms/VisualStudio.Extensibility. We encourage you to report bugs and suggest features via the issue tracker on our GitHub repo, where you can also find extension samples to help you get started. We have also launched a new video series on Visual Studio Toolbox to provide a more detailed tour of our samples. Check out the series here!\nWhat’s new for VisualStudio.Extensibility for 17.14?\nOur 17.14 release of VisualStudio.Extensibility includes the following features:\n\nText classification support\nUpdates to the ShowPromptAsync API\n\nThis release also includes a previously mentioned change regarding .NET runtime management requirements. VisualStudio.Extensibility extensions are executed on a separate .NET runtime host, unlike VSSDK extensions which run in the same process as devenv.exe, using the .NET Framework runtime. Since VisualStudio.Extensibility extensions operate on .NET, we must adhere to the runtime servicing lifetime of .NET. Consequently, the VisualStudio.Extensibility platform will be regularly updated to advance to newer versions of .NET LTS. For more information on how this affects you as an extension developer or consumer, please refer to our documentation here.\nColor text in files with classification support\nIn Visual Studio 17.13, we added support for taggers in the editor, allowing advanced functionalities such as custom code lens providers. This enhancement laid the groundwork for the text classification feature we are introducing in 17.14. Text classification facilitates custom text coloring within an opened file, commonly referred to as semantic and syntactic colorization. The following snippet demonstrates the creation of classification tags, which are fundamental to implementing editor classification. Please note that the example provided is a very simplistic approach and should not be used without further refinement. For a more comprehensive guide on writing a classification extension, please refer to our documentation and sample materials.\nprivate async Task CreateTagsAsync(ITextDocumentSnapshot document)\n{\n   List<TaggedTrackingTextRange<ClassificationTag>> tags = new();\n   foreach (var line in document.Lines)\n   {\n      var match = LineRegex.Match(line.Text.CopyToString());\n\n      if (match.Success)\n      {\n         foreach (Capture capture in match.Groups[FieldTextMatchName].Captures)\n         {\n            tags.Add(new(\nnew(document, line.Text.Start + capture.Index, capture.Length, TextRangeTrackingMode.ExtendNone),\nnew(ClassificationType.KnownValues.String)));\n         }\n      }\n   }\n\n   await this.UpdateTagsAsync(\n      updatedRanges: [new(document, 0, document.Length)],\n      tags,\n      CancellationToken.None);\n}\n\nDisplay icons and prompt for input with an enhanced ShowPromptAsync API\nWe routinely assess suggestion tickets that track requests for new APIs to be integrated into VisualStudio.Extensibility. Numerous factors influence our decision on which features to prioritize, including the complexity and cost of implementation. In version 17.14, we are pleased to announce that we have addressed a community-requested feature by introducing icon support in our ShowPromptAsync API. Furthermore, we have added the capability to provide user-input prompt. Below is a code snippet demonstrating how to configure a user prompt with custom icons, titles, messages, and options. For more detailed information, please refer to our documentation.\n// Show a prompt that accepts string input from the user, with a default value, custom title and custom icon.\n\nstring? feedback = await shell.ShowPromptAsync(\n   $\"Thank you for configuring {projectName}. Do you have any feedback?\",\n   new InputPromptOptions\n   {\n      DefaultText = feedbackPrompt,\n      Icon = ImageMoniker.KnownValues.Feedback,\n      Title = Title,\n   },\n   cancellationToken);\n\nthis.logger.TraceInformation($\"Feedback received: {feedback}\");\n\nWe want to hear from you!\nWe appreciate the time you’ve spent reporting issues/suggestions and hope you continue to give us feedback when using Visual Studio on what you like and what we can improve. Your feedback is critical to help us make Visual Studio the best tool it can be! You can share feedback with us via Developer Community: report any bugs or issues via report a problem and share your suggestions for new features or improvements to existing ones.\nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Twitch and on Microsoft Learn.\nThe post VisualStudio.Extensibility: Editor classification and updates to user prompt appeared first on Visual Studio Blog."

Agent mode in Visual Studio allows you to define tasks using natural language, with Copilot autonomously planning, editing your codebase, invoking tools, and iterating to resolve issues.

You can access the Copilot Chat window from the Copilot badge in the upper right of the IDE.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Using agent mode</h2>\n<p>Agent mode is a powerful tool that can be applied in many scenarios. It can create apps from scratch, refactor code across multiple files, write and run tests, generate documentation, integrate new libraries, implement terminal-heavy tasks, and answer questions about complex codebases. It enhances productivity by orchestrating your development flow while keeping you in control. When determining if agent mode is the right tool for the job, consider the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Edit scope</strong>: Agent mode takes the reins, autonomously searching your codebase and determining the relevant context and files to edit.</li>\n<li><strong>Task complexity</strong>: For intricate tasks that go beyond simple code edits, agent mode shines. It handles tool invocations and terminal commands, making it ideal for complex projects.</li>\n<li><strong>Duration</strong>: Agent mode is thorough, involving multiple steps to process a request. It might take longer to get a response as it determines the context, plans the action, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-iteration</strong>: One of the standout features of agent mode is its ability to evaluate the outcome of generated edits and iterate multiple times to resolve intermediate issues.</li>\n<li><strong>Multiple requests</strong>: Depending on the complexity of the task, agent mode might result in multiple requests to the backend from a single prompt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Once you&#8217;ve determined that agent mode is the right tool for the job, you just need to give it a good prompt. Here are some example prompts to give you an idea of what you can ask the agent to do:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">&#8220;Add error handling to this API&#8221;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">&#8220;Convert this project to use environment variables&#8221;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">&#8220;Write tests for this class and fix anything that fails&#8221;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> &#8220;Add structured logging with Serilog&#8221;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">&#8220;Replace </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">HttpClient</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> with </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">IHttpClientFactory&#8221;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A key to better, more accurate responses from Copilot is providing it with sufficient context about your preferred coding standards, team preferences, libraries, and more. You can provide this context with <strong>custom instructions</strong>. The custom instructions feature enables you to automatically add pre-specified contextual details to your chat questions. To configure custom instructions, follow the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/copilot-chat-context?view=vs-2022#enable-custom-instructions\">documentation instructions</a>.</p>\n<h2>Boost agent mode with MCP servers</h2>\n<p>This release further extends the power of agent mode by supporting <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction\">Model Context Protocol (MCP</a>) servers. MCP servers provide additional context to the Copilot agent and give it access to tools, data, and resources. The MCP website describes MCP as a universal adaptor for AI applications. In the same way that a universal adaptor lets you connect your physical devices to accessories, MCP lets you connect AI applications to other data and tools without needing to build a custom connection to each data source. For example, you can connect directly to your database and analyze schemes, pull in information for GitHub repos such as issues and pull requests, automate end-to-end testing with Playwright, or you can even build your own with several SDKs including C#! <span data-contrast=\"auto\">Here are a few other examples of what you can do with MCP servers:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Interact with your cloud environment</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">: For example, the official Azure MCP server gives access to list, query, and interact with services and tools like Azure Storage, Cosmos DB, the Azure CLI, and more.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Query and manage database: </span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Execute queries against Cosmos DB containers, get Azure Storage container properties and metadata, and manage blob containers and blobs.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Search and manage version control platform</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">: For example, the GitHub API allows batch creation of issues or batch updates of files, can search for code and issues across GitHub repositories, and more.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-253201\" src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/05/word-image-253199-2.jpeg\" alt=\"Filter tools options for agent mode\" width=\"987\" height=\"621\" srcset=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/05/word-image-253199-2.jpeg 987w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/05/word-image-253199-2-300x189.jpeg 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/05/word-image-253199-2-768x483.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 987px) 100vw, 987px\" /></p>\n<h2>More updates with new monthly release schedule for Copilot</h2>\n<p>We’re constantly evolving to get Copilot features out so that you, the developer, are never behind.

To configure custom instructions, follow the documentation instructions.\nBoost agent mode with MCP servers\nThis release further extends the power of agent mode by supporting Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. MCP servers provide additional context to the Copilot agent and give it access to tools, data, and resources. The MCP website describes MCP as a universal adaptor for AI applications. In the same way that a universal adaptor lets you connect your physical devices to accessories, MCP lets you connect AI applications to other data and tools without needing to build a custom connection to each data source. For example, you can connect directly to your database and analyze schemes, pull in information for GitHub repos such as issues and pull requests, automate end-to-end testing with Playwright, or you can even build your own with several SDKs including C#! Here are a few other examples of what you can do with MCP servers: \nInteract with your cloud environment: For example, the official Azure MCP server gives access to list, query, and interact with services and tools like Azure Storage, Cosmos DB, the Azure CLI, and more. \nQuery and manage database: Execute queries against Cosmos DB containers, get Azure Storage container properties and metadata, and manage blob containers and blobs. \nSearch and manage version control platform: For example, the GitHub API allows batch creation of issues or batch updates of files, can search for code and issues across GitHub repositories, and more. \n\nMore updates with new monthly release schedule for Copilot\nWe’re constantly evolving to get Copilot features out so that you, the developer, are never behind.
