If you are a paid user, auto applies a 10% request discount. For example, if auto selects Sonnet 4.5, it will be counted as 0.9x of a premium request.\nIf you are a paid user and run out of premium requests, auto will always choose a 0x model (for example, GPT-4.1), so you can continue using auto without interruption.\nWhat’s next\nOur long-term vision for auto. We aim to make auto the best model selection for most users and to achieve this, here’s what we plan next:\n\nDynamically switch between small and large models based on the task – this flexibility ensures that you get the right balance of performance and efficiency, while saving on requests\nAdd more language models to auto\nLet users on a free plan take advantage of the latest models through auto\nImprove the model dropdown to make it more obvious which models and discounts are used\n\nThanks \nThe post Introducing Copilot auto model selection (preview) appeared first on Visual Studio Blog."

In this month, we are bringing you improvements to model choices and agentic flows. \n\nNew Models \nWe now have Claude Sonnet 4.5  and Claude Haiku 4.5 available in the chat window. This means the latest innovations for driving your agentic workflows is right at your fingertips. \nMemories \n\nFor Copilot to work effectively for your unique team and repository, it needs to learn about your project and team best practices. Copilot memories enable Copilot to understand and apply your project’s specific coding standards, making it project-aware and consistent across sessions. \nHow Copilot memories work \nMemories use intelligent detection to understand your team’s preferences as you prompt in the chat. That means, as you prompt how you normally would, Copilot is looking for instances where you correct its behavior, explicitly indicate a standard, or ask it to remember something. When detected, you’ll see a confirmation nudge to save the preference. Copilot will then categorize the preference into one of three files: \n\n.editorconfig for coding standards \nCONTRIBUTING.md for best practices, guidelines, architectural standards, etc. \nand README.md for high level project information \n\nSo, as you prompt, you’re not only teaching Copilot how to respond better to you in the future, but you’re also helping out your team by documenting your development best practices, and augmenting their future Copilot responses as well! \nPlanning \n\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/10/Planning-quick-quick-1.mp4\nCopilot Chat now includes built-in planning to help guide large, multi-step tasks.  \nWhen you ask a complex question, Copilot automatically creates a markdown plan file with: \n\nA task list  \nThe files it plans to edit  \nContext for its approach \n\nAs it works, Copilot updates the plan in real time – tracking progress, adapting to blockers, and keeping its logic transparent. \nPlanning is fully visible, scoped to your goal, and implemented through tool calling, making behavior more predictable, reliable, and easy to follow. \nTry it out: Ask Copilot to refactor a component, add a new feature, or fix bugs across multiple files. \n Plan files are temporary by default. To reuse or share them across threads, save the file into your repo. \nTo learn more about planning or share your feedback, check out the blog post. \nInstruction Files \n\nGetting Copilot to respond the way you want can be a challenge. You may have different coding standards, best practices, or architectural patterns in different areas of your codebase. With instruction files, you can now target specific instructions to specific folders or files in your repository, making Copilot truly project-aware and consistent across sessions. \nEnable the feature \nTurn on the feature at Tools > Options > GitHub > Copilot > Copilot Chat > Enable custom instructions to be loaded from .github/instructions/*.instructions.md files and added to requests. \nWrite instruction files \n\nFormat your instructions with the applyTo header and specify a glob pattern for which files you want these instructions to be included for. \n\n--- \n \napplyTo: \"src/**/*.cs\" \n \n---\n\nIn the file body, you can use natural language to specify your content and reference other instruction files to compose instructions together.  \n\n\nSave the file with the .instructions.md file extension in the root of your repository in the .github/instructions folder. \n\nTip: You can even get Copilot’s help refining your instructions to be more detailed. \nHow it works \nWhen you prompt Copilot, it will automatically detect which instruction files apply to the files in your current context and attach them as references. You can see which instructions were attached by clicking on the references in the response card. \nBring Your Own Model with Azure Foundry\nWant the ultimate layer of control over which models you’re using in GitHub Copilot Chat? Try out the new Azure Foundry integration to bring your own models.\nCheck out the new Visual Studio Hub \nStay connected with everything in Visual Studio in one place! Visit the Visual Studio Hub for the latest release notes, YouTube videos, social updates, and community discussions. \nAppreciation for your feedback \nYour feedback helps us improve Visual Studio, making it an even more powerful tool for developers. We are immensely grateful for your contributions and look forward to your continued support. By sharing your thoughts, ideas, and any issues you encounter through Developer Community, you help us improve and shape the future of Visual Studio.\nThe post Visual Studio October Update – new models, memories, planning, and more appeared first on Visual Studio Blog."

And for those of you who rely on extensions to get your work done, you can rest assured that your favorite extensions will continue to function smoothly with Visual Studio 2026.</p>\n<p>The rest of this post will offer in-depth guidance for extension developers.</p>\n<h2>Principles of a modern extension compatibility model</h2>\n<p>If you are an experienced developer in the Visual Studio ecosystem, you’re probably well-acquainted with vsixmanifest files and managing the version ranges in installation targets. Traditionally, each major release of Visual Studio meant updating the upper bound of your supported version range and checking for potential compatibility issues. However, with Visual Studio 2026, this routine has changed &#8211; extensions built for Visual Studio 2022 have transferred seamlessly to Visual Studio 2026 without any modifications required.</p>\n<p>The new extension compatibility model for Visual Studio is guided by three core principles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Extensions specify the API versions they are built against.</strong> Visual Studio evaluates which API versions are supported at load time and only loads extensions compatible with those versions. This represents a shift from the previous approach, where extensions indicated the Visual Studio versions they supported. We understand that there are many parts to what make up the full API set for extending Visual Studio, and we are working on providing a clearer picture going forward.</li>\n<li><strong>The Visual Studio platform aims to minimize or eliminate breaking changes to stable APIs.</strong> We understand that Visual Studio 2022 was a disruptive transition for many extension authors with our shift from 32 to 64 bit. Going forward, we commit to a smoother and more streamlined migration process.</li>\n<li><strong>Additive changes will undergo an iterative process prior to being released as stable.</strong> As new features are introduced, we will add new APIs to extend these features. However, new APIs require a period of iteration during which modifications and potential breaks may occur.

Simply put, if you have a Visual Studio 2022 extension, you don’t need to modify it for compatibility with Visual Studio 2026. This is because Visual Studio 2026 supports API version 17.x, and we determine API compatibility using only the lower bound of the installation target version range &#8211; ignoring the upper bound from now on. The following example demonstrates an extension that works with Visual Studio 2022, and no updates are necessary if this describes your situation.</p>\n<pre>&lt;InstallationTarget Id=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Community\" Version=\"[17.0, 18.0)\"&gt;</pre>\n<p>If you use Visual Studio 2026 to create new extensions, you’ll notice that the lower bound will be automatically set to 17.0, with the upper bound left empty, as demonstrated in the example below.</p>\n<pre>&lt;InstallationTarget Id=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Community\" Version=\"[17.0,)\"&gt;</pre>\n<p>This means that any new extensions created will now automatically target both Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio 2026!</p>\n<p>Despite the easy migration process, we still recommend that extenders test their extensions on Visual Studio 2026 to catch any compatibility bugs. If you find an issue is likely caused by the platform, please file a feedback ticket using <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio?view=visualstudio\">Report a Problem</a>.</p>\n<p>The smooth migration process for getting extensions in Visual Studio only applies to VSIX-based extensions. Developers who maintain MSI-based extensions are responsible for managing how users install them, and these MSI installers would need to adapt to this updated approach. Our general recommendation is that extension authors do not create MSI installers and just use VSIX to distribute their extensions.</p>\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\n<p>Are you wondering about new APIs that will support extending new features in Visual Studio 2026? These are part of the ongoing additive changes, and we&#8217;re not ready to release them yet because we are still refining their design. Once they are ready, we&#8217;ll make them available as preview packages first, allowing interested developers to test them and share feedback.

    "raw": "<p data-start=\"324\" data-end=\"762\">Before joining Microsoft, I served as VP of Application Development at one of the largest temporary staffing companies in the United States. I’ll never forget the look on our CFO’s face when I told him we needed two to three additional cloud environments to support a large-scale modernization project. His expression went from curious to cautious as he started calculating what that might mean for compute, storage, and database costs.</p>\n<p data-start=\"764\" data-end=\"869\">“You want three more cloud environments? Do you have any idea what that’s going to cost us each month?”</p>\n<p data-start=\"871\" data-end=\"1153\">He wasn’t wrong to ask. Expanding our cloud footprint could easily double our monthly spend. What he didn’t realize was that we already had a built-in advantage—<strong data-start=\"1032\" data-end=\"1151\">a Visual Studio Subscription benefit that provides discounted Dev/Test rates for non-production workloads in Azure.</strong></p>\n<hr data-start=\"1251\" data-end=\"1254\" />\n<h2 data-start=\"1256\" data-end=\"1277\">Why This Matters</h2>\n<p>Like many enterprises, we were expanding our cloud footprint to support a modernization effort that touched multiple systems across accounting, ticketing, and field operations. Running in parallel across so many integration streams required more than just production and staging.

    "sanitized": "Before joining Microsoft, I served as VP of Application Development at one of the largest temporary staffing companies in the United States. I’ll never forget the look on our CFO’s face when I told him we needed two to three additional cloud environments to support a large-scale modernization project. His expression went from curious to cautious as he started calculating what that might mean for compute, storage, and database costs.\n“You want three more cloud environments? Do you have any idea what that’s going to cost us each month?”\nHe wasn’t wrong to ask. Expanding our cloud footprint could easily double our monthly spend. What he didn’t realize was that we already had a built-in advantage—a Visual Studio Subscription benefit that provides discounted Dev/Test rates for non-production workloads in Azure.\n\nWhy This Matters\nLike many enterprises, we were expanding our cloud footprint to support a modernization effort that touched multiple systems across accounting, ticketing, and field operations. Running in parallel across so many integration streams required more than just production and staging. We needed additional cloud environments for accounting integration, API modernization, mobile development, and quality assurance — each one mirroring production as closely as possible.\nThe challenge wasn’t technical, it was financial. Every new environment meant more compute, more storage, and higher monthly costs. Our CFO was right to ask where that money would come from.\nThat’s when I discovered something already included in our Visual Studio Professional and Enterprise subscriptions — the Azure Dev/Test benefit.\n\n \nThis benefit allows Visual Studio subscribers to run Windows and SQL Server VMs in Azure at the same base rates as Linux VMs of equivalent size. The Microsoft licensing costs are waived for development and testing, so you only pay for compute while it’s running. It’s a simple change with major impact: production-level environments for non-production costs.\n\nThe Pilot That Changed Everything\nWith cautious approval, I launched a pilot to test the Dev/Test benefit in action. Within a week, our team replicated the entire production environment in Azure using discounted Dev/Test rates. There were no procurement delays, no licensing complexities, and no approval bottlenecks—just straightforward cloud provisioning with real cost transparency.\nThat one-week turnaround shattered our assumptions about how quickly we could scale and test new workloads in the cloud.\n\nWhy Developers Love Dev/Test\nWhen I lead focus groups at Visual Studio Live! events, I often ask developers which subscription benefits stand out beyond the IDE itself. The Azure Dev/Test benefit consistently ranks near the top. Developers tell me the same two things every time:\n\nPrototyping freedom: they can spin up environments on demand to test ideas without waiting for budget approvals.\nProduction-grade testing: they can validate integrations and updates in environments that mirror production, without the production-level price tag.\n\nIt’s one of the most valuable capabilities hidden in plain sight.

This option provides centralized billing and the broadest management capabilities for teams running multiple non-production environments.\nPay-As-You-Go Dev/Test: ideal for individual developers or small teams with Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise subscriptions who are not covered under an Enterprise Agreement.\nAzure Plan for Dev/Test: designed for customers with Microsoft Customer Agreements (MCA), offering simplified modern billing and flexibility as organizations transition away from legacy agreements.\n\nEach path unlocks the same Dev/Test discounts already included with your Visual Studio subscription, helping you run Windows and SQL Server workloads in Azure at significantly reduced rates for development and testing.\n\nThe Takeaway\nMost IT leaders still think of Visual Studio subscriptions as just IDE licenses. In reality, the Azure Dev/Test benefit is one of the fastest ways to reduce cloud spend while accelerating development.\nSeveral customers have told me this single benefit can easily justify the full cost of a Visual Studio subscription through cloud-computing savings alone.\nThe real question isn’t whether you can afford to modernize. The real question is whether you can afford not to take advantage of the benefits you already own.\n Sign in to my.visualstudio.com today to explore Azure Dev/Test pricing and see how it can accelerate your next project.\nThe post Visual Studio Dev/Test Benefit Explained appeared first on Visual Studio Blog."
