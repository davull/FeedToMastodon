2025.6: Getting picky about Bluetooth

Home Assistant 2025.6! 🎉
We are already half way through 2025, can you believe it? I personally can’t, as it feels like we just started the year. Not just that, there are so many exciting things to still come this year, and I can’t wait to share them with you!
Anyway, the June release is here! A week later than usual, but it also means we had an extra week to polish and beta test this release. Like the previous release...
