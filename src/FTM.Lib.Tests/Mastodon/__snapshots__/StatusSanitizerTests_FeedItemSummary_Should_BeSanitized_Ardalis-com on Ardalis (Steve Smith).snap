Thanks!\nI work with a lot of different.NET developers as a trainer, architect, and consultant with NimblePros. One thing that I’m frequently pointing out to them is the difference in startup speed for their applications when launching from Visual Studio. Many, I would even say most,.NET developers have developed\"muscle memory\" of hitting F5 (or clicking the\"Play\" button) in order to launch their applications. And why not? This was the only toolbar button available for many years, and F5 is a simple enough key to remember, and is literally called\"Start\"."
