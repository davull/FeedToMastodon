I decided to riff on that to create what was initially just a business card, but then I enhanced it with some additional functionality, making a full-blown <strong>Ardalis CLI</strong> tool, which mostly just gets you access to content from me in your terminal.</p>\n<p>You can find <a href=\"https://github.com/ardalis/ardalis-card-dnx\">the source</a> for my <code>ardalis</code> command line interface as well as its <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/ardalis\">listing on NuGet</a>.

You see this all the time in various APIs, and it&rsquo;s a frequent source of bugs and confusion. Developers are forced to either guess or try to find the documentation that describes what units <code>int timeout</code> or <code>int delay</code> actually uses.</p>\n<p>Having a retry delay of 1 millisecond instead of 1 second, for example, is a huge difference - that&rsquo;s 1000x more load on your system! But so is having a timeout of 1000 seconds (nearly 17 minutes!) instead of 1000 milliseconds (1 second). Either way, it&rsquo;s three orders of magnitude away from the expected and intended behavior, which can lead to production incidents and difficult-to-diagnose bugs.</p>",

One thing that I&rsquo;m frequently pointing out to them is the difference in startup speed for their applications when launching from Visual Studio. Many, I would even say most,.NET developers have developed&quot;muscle memory&quot; of hitting F5 (or clicking the&quot;Play&quot; button) in order to launch their applications. And why not? This was the only toolbar button available for many years, and F5 is a simple enough key to remember, and is literally called&quot;Start&quot;.</p>",

Its job is to transfer data, and it can be used both to <em>send</em> data and to <em>receive</em> it. Often, data transferred will use different types (possibly even different programming languages and technology stacks) on each end of the transfer. The only thing you can count on transferring is the <em>data</em> - nothing else. Which leads to the first rule for DTOs.</p>",

In one scenario, the&quot;current model&quot; is your C# code in its current most-recently-saved state. If you just added a property called <code>Name</code> to an entity class, you&rsquo;re thinking that is your current model. But another <em>version</em> of the model is in a snapshot file, and that one is only updated when you create a migration. And another <em>version</em> of the model is in the/a database. And <em>that</em> one is only updated when you do a database update or deployment. So, keep in mind as you continue reading that there are always several different versions of your model that are in various states, and ultimately should be synchronized by the migration process.</p>",

      "Summary": "<p>Most.NET apps use EF Core and a DbContext for data access, but maintainability can suffer when the use of a DbContext or an IQueryable derived from it is allowed to spread throughout an application. Let&rsquo;s briefly describe how IQueryable works with EF Core and then consider how restricting access to IQuerable (or not) affects the overall maintainability of an app.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-iqueryable\">What is IQueryable</h2>\n<p>The <code>IQueryable</code> and <code>IQueryable&lt;T&gt;</code> interfaces in.NET allow queries to be described as expression trees, which upon execution can be traversed and translated by a query provider. In the case of EF Core, <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.iqueryable?view=net-7.0\">IQueryable interfaces</a> are used to allow for dynamic SQL query generation. This in turn allows for granular and efficient queries to be executed on the database, rather than pulling more data than needed into application memory and then filtering the result in memory.</p>",
