      "Content": "<p>A key Tesla safety engineer has departed from the company, as shared earlier this month, following nearly a decade and a half spent working across three of the automaker&#8217;s locations.</p>\n<p>In a post on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petter-winberg-2b227712_elon-2011-i-want-tesla-vehicles-to-be-activity-7303685815665090560-eqCD/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn</a> last week, Tesla&#8217;s Principal CAE Crash Safety Engineer, Petter Winberg, announced his departure from the company after working there for over 14 years. Winberg played a major role in <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-posts-q4-2024-vehicle-safety-report/\">Tesla&#8217;s efforts to make its vehicles some of the safest out there</a>, starting as a Senior Tech Specialist in 2011 and slowly getting promoted to his current position.</p>\n<p>In his position, Winberg worked on crash architectures for the Cybercab, Semi, and future vehicles, along with the Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Model Y, and developing specific accident architectures once Giga Casting production came into play. The executive&#8217;s full departure announcement reads as follows:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Elon, 2011: “I want Tesla vehicles to be the safest on the planet” Me: “Challenge accepted”</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Having developed Model S, S-DM, X, 3, Y, Y-SP as well as future crash architectures, I have decided now is the time to move on. Thank you Tesla, keep crushing it! What an incredible team, I will miss you all.</em></p>\n<p><strong>READ MORE ON TESLA SAFETY: <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-executive-responds-fatal-accident/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tesla executive responds to claims of high fatal accident rate</a></strong></p>\n<p>During his time at Tesla, the engineer worked at the company&#8217;s engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, California, before moving to the company&#8217;s nearby Fremont factory, then finally landing at the automaker&#8217;s Gothenburg, Sweden facilities, where he has served in his current position since January 2020. Prior to this, Winberg also worked at Volvo, Saab, Ford, and Volvo.</p>\n<p>The post also elicited a handful of comments from colleagues, including one commenter who called Winberg the &#8220;master of crash simulations,&#8221; and multiple others who praised him for his guidance and knowledge of the subject.</p>\n<p>Tesla has also been heavily focused on making its vehicles safe since the early days, as Winberg points out.</p>\n<p>As one example in October, <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-exec-company-practice-encourage-safe-vehicles/\">Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy</a> reiterated this point by highlighting both the company&#8217;s active and passive safety features included in the Model Y and other vehicles. Moravy detailed that, while features built-in for the Autopilot and Supervised Full Self-Driving (FSD) systems provide active safety features meant to help prevent crashes, even if &#8220;the worst occurs, [Tesla drivers] will be protected by the best passive safety cars on the planet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s vehicles have also earned <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-highlights-top-safety-scores-continents/\">top safety ratings across four different continents</a> at this point, most recently including a <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-five-star-safety/\">five-star safety rating for the Cybertruck from the top auto regulator in the U.S.</a></p>\n<p>Over the last several months, Tesla has also faced executive and high-profile engineering departures a handful of times, as can probably be expected from most companies of its size.</p>\n<p>Some examples include the <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-executive-delays-european-adas-regulations/\">departure of Safety Policy Lead Marc Van Impe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-robotaxi-event-executive-exit/\">Chief Information Officer Nagesh Saldi</a> in October, <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-vp-finance-business-operations-departs-11-years/\">VP of Finance and Business Operations Sreela Venkataratnam</a> in August, and both <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-exec-drew-baglino-leaves-after-18-years/\">SVP of Powertrain and Energy Engineering Drew Baglino</a> and <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-vp-public-policy-rohan-patel-departs-8-year-stint/\">VP of Public Policy and Business Development Rohan Patel</a> in April, to name just a few.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"llo3QaBS6k\"><p><a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/former-tesla-engineer-federal-tech/\">This former Tesla engineer now heads a federal tech department</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\"  title=\"&#8220;This former Tesla engineer now heads a federal tech department&#8221; &#8212; TESLARATI\" src=\"https://www.teslarati.com/former-tesla-engineer-federal-tech/embed/#?secret=nDr8OEI67I#?secret=llo3QaBS6k\" data-secret=\"llo3QaBS6k\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-safety-engineer-left-14-years/\">This Tesla safety engineer just left after over 14 years</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com\">TESLARATI</a>.</p>\n",

      "Content": "<p>Tesla&#8217;s Full Self-Driving (FSD) started going out for testing in China last month, representing the first market outside of North America to get the software. Amidst competition in the automated driving space from a number of other Chinese companies, Tesla&#8217;s FSD seems to be impressing in early reviews, with recent reviews highlighting both the software&#8217;s smoothness and its ability to adapt and perform well on non-traditional roads.</p>\n<p>In a Saturday video originally posted by user 王船船 on <a href=\"https://www.douyin.com/video/7481958256252865828\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Douyin</a>, the Chinese version of TikTok, a driver utilizes the <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-china-fsd-style-city-autopilot-first-impressions/\">Supervised FSD system</a> while performing what&#8217;s called the &#8220;water challenge,&#8221; in which a cup of water is balanced on the driver&#8217;s side window ledge to see if driving is smooth enough to avoid spilling.</p>\n<p>The drive spans a little more than four minutes, and the system manages to make it through without the water spilling in any substantial quantities. The driver mostly remains on city streets, but you can see a handful of quick, unexpected stops, turns, and other maneuvers that one might expect to make the cup tip completely.</p>\n<p>The video was also reposted on X by Tesla&#8217;s main account, with the company highlighting the system&#8217;s &#8220;maximum smoothness&#8221; as demonstrated in the video. Tesla VP of AI Ashok Elluswamy also reposted the video, saying in a separate follow-up <a href=\"https://x.com/aelluswamy/status/1900859967386869986\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> that &#8220;FSD&#8217;s been prepared for this one.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-media-max-width=\"560\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Maximum smoothness <a href=\"https://t.co/p4aM3StgRk\">https://t.co/p4aM3StgRk</a></p>\n<p>— Tesla (@Tesla) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1900992067666641338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Although Tesla&#8217;s FSD system didn&#8217;t have access to real-world driving data from the company&#8217;s vehicles at the time of its launch in China, Elon Musk recently explained that the company used publicly available video from the internet to help <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-train-fsd-china-roads/\">pre-train FSD for Chinese streets and traffic laws</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to helping with city streets, Tesla has explained in the past that its camera- and video-based FSD neural network training makes the system easily scalable to multiple countries, fringe traffic cases, and even less traditional roads.</p>\n<p>As another example of this in China, FSD testers also took to some dirt roads last week, showing just how well the software seems to handle some seemingly-deep and super-narrow back roads.

in arson attack in France, investigation underway</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I spoke to about a dozen protestors about what they were protesting against. Most said they were there to condemn Musk&#8217;s recent federal worker and program cuts with the Trump administration, his performance of what some said resembled a Nazi salute at Trump&#8217;s inauguration ceremony in January, or the administration&#8217;s recent attacks against transgender and queer individuals.</p>\n<p>One protestor, Elsa, identified as a former Republican and said she was &#8220;highly concerned that our Constitution is being ignored,&#8221; especially with regards to the three branches of government and the system of checks and balances.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It surprises me that, even if you voted for Trump, or you believe in capitalism, which, I didn&#8217;t vote for Trump, but I do believe in capitalism — I&#8217;m a former Republican, I was a Republican for most of my life — but it&#8217;s dangerous to have power rest in a handful of ultra-wealthy people,&#8221; Elsa said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And our whole country needs to realize that,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;This to me is not even Republican or Democrat at this point.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Instead, she says it now comes down to whether people want to give billionaires huge tax breaks, or to use that money to support a range of groups in the U.S., including those who have social security benefits, are veterans, or are 9/11 survivors seeking cancer treatments, as a few examples.</p>\n<p>Another protestor, Mary, said she was taking part in the demonstration &#8220;because she loves this country and democracy,&#8221; adding that she wanted to help preserve democracy for her grandchildren.</p>\n<p>Still another protestor, Bryan, said that they were protesting because of the Trump administration and Musk&#8217;s attempts to erase transgender, non-binary, and queer people from history, drawing comparisons to the rise of fascism in Nazi Germany, where early human rights violations were lodged against gay and queer communities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here because I have to be,&#8221; Bryan said. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of the future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yet another person and his family were holding Ukraine flags, saying that they were protesting for a wide range of reasons, but especially for Trump&#8217;s recent meeting with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Musk&#8217;s claims that the top Ukrainian executive was to blame for what he has called a &#8220;forever war.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While most protestors appeared to be generally friendly, especially with each other, I did hear a few exchanges between demonstrators and those with other opinions. While I heard more cars honking throughout the experience, seemingly in support of the protests, I also noticed a few from which passengers yelled things like &#8220;Go Trump.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Direct action, we need to stop these fascists with direct action,&#8221; one protestor yelled in response.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I also talked to a prospective customer, Kristy, who was there for a test drive and said she had a negative experience with the protestors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was test driving a Tesla, and as we pulled in and parked right here, this black one, these people right here in the middle yelled at me, &#8216;Hope you&#8217;re turning in your f*cking Nazi car,&#8217; and I said &#8216;F*ck you,'&#8221; Kristy explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And they&#8217;re like &#8216;F*ck you too, you&#8217;re a Nazi, f*cking Nazi lovers.&#8217; And so, they&#8217;re just yelling racial slurs at me, and I&#8217;m far from a Nazi.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tesla store advisers declined to comment on the protests, and so did Loveland police.</p>\n<h3>Other Saturday protest footage from Tesla stores in California, Texas, and New York</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-store-colorado-vandalized-fire/\">Loveland Tesla store has also been the site of repeated attacks</a> in recent weeks, with authorities on Friday making a second arrest following multiple incidents.

The rebound comes after Tesla experienced a downturn in several European markets in the first two months of 2025.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tesla Model Y Reclaims Top Spot in Norway</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla’s sales are showing signs of recovery in Norway, the world’s EV stronghold. As per data from <a href=\"https://elbilstatistikk.no/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Norwegian Electric Vehicle Statistics</a>, which is updated in real time, the new Model Y has surged to the top of registration charts this March. As of writing, Tesla has logged 485 Model Y registrations this month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Model 3 is showing strength in Norway as well, coming in second with 267 units this March so far. For context, the Tesla Model Y only saw 283 registrations in the same period in February, while the Model 3 saw 129.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tesla-comeback-Norway-1024x520.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-285139\" srcset=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tesla-comeback-Norway-1024x520.jpg 1024w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tesla-comeback-Norway-300x152.jpg 300w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tesla-comeback-Norway-768x390.jpg 768w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tesla-comeback-Norway-1536x781.jpg 1536w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tesla-comeback-Norway-2048x1041.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: <a href=\"https://elbilstatistikk.no/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Norwegian Electric Vehicle Statistics</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sweden Sees Model Y Registration Rise</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tesla Model Y is also staging a comeback in Sweden, with the all-electric crossover ranking as the third most registered vehicle through March 12, as per <a href=\"https://www.car.info/sv-se/tesla/stats?from=2025-01&amp;to=2025-01&amp;period=d&amp;vd=4.8.18.19.20&amp;tcs=new_registered&amp;tcg=new_registered&amp;tcf=registered&amp;tci=\">Car.info</a> data cited by <em><a href=\"https://carup.se/nya-siffror-teslas-vandning-i-mars-efter-jatteraset/\">CarUp</a></em>. With 318 units already registered this March, the Model Y has already outpaced January’s total of 299 and is closing in on February’s 479. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tesla Model 3, however, lags with just 60 registrations in March so far. This could be attributed to the fact that the Model 3 is still imported, while the Model Y is produced in Gigafactory Berlin, Tesla’s European factory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>New Model Y Fuels Optimism</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla’s rough 2025 start saw sales plummet in markets such as Norway and Sweden, where February losses exceeded 40%. Yet, early March data points to a potential shift, thanks to the start of customer deliveries of the new Model Y.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While full March outcomes remain uncertain, the <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-uk-sales-elon-musk/\">upswing in registrations</a>—especially in EV-centric Norway—offers hope that Tesla can reclaim ground lost to rivals in January and February.

As per the CEO, Tesla is “still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of 2025 and will continue to expand our lineup from there.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla, however, has so far been very tight-lipped about its affordable model, leading to speculations that the vehicles may simply be stripped-down versions of the Model 3 and Model Y, the company’s two best-sellers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cheaper-model-initial-details-leaked/\">Tesla &#8220;cheaper model&#8221; initial details shared in recent Reuters report</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com\">TESLARATI</a>.</p>\n",
