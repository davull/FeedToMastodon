I personally can’t, as it feels like we just started the year. Not just that, there are so many exciting things to still come this year, and I can’t wait to share them with you!</p>\n<p>Anyway, the June release is here! A week later than usual, but it also means we had an extra week to polish and beta test this release. Like the <a href=\"/blog/2025/05/07/release-20255/\">previous release</a>, this release is packed with quality-of-life improvements!</p>\n<p>Last release my favorite feature was the new entity picker; this release, we improved ALL other pickers! No surprise that this, again, makes it to my top favorite this release. Although the ability to group media players directly from the media player card is a close second. It is so nice to see how Home Assistant keeps getting better and better, and how our community keeps contributing to it. 😍</p>\n<p>If you are leveraging Bluetooth in your Home Assistant setup, you will also love the new Bluetooth connection graph that shows how your Bluetooth devices are connected, including Bluetooth proxies. Troubleshooting Bluetooth has become so much easier now!</p>\n<p>Enjoy the release!</p>\n<p>../Frenck</p>\n<p><em>PS: We will pick up the regular release schedule again now, so expect the next release on the first Wednesday of July (July 2nd).</em></p>\n<!--more-->\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#improving-all-the-pickers\">Improving all the “pickers”</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#making-sense-of-bluetooth\">Making sense of Bluetooth</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#iterations-of-the-experimental-area-dashboard\">Iterations of the experimental area dashboard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#deprecating-installation-methods-and-32-bit-architectures\">Deprecating installation methods and 32-bit architectures</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#integrations\">Integrations</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#new-integrations\">New integrations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#noteworthy-improvements-to-existing-integrations\">Noteworthy improvements to existing integrations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#integration-quality-scale-achievements\">Integration quality scale achievements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#farewell-to-the-following\">Farewell to the following</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#other-noteworthy-changes\">Other noteworthy changes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#sidebar-improvements\">Sidebar improvements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#joinunjoin-groups-of-media-players\">Join/unjoin groups of media players</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#resetrestore-entity-ids\">Reset/restore entity IDs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#patch-releases\">Patch releases</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#202561---june-13\">2025.6.1 - June 13</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#need-help-join-the-community\">Need help?

Pickers are <em>everywhere</em> in Home Assistant, being used in automations, scripts, and configuration options.</p>\n<p>Last release, we <a href=\"/blog/2025/05/07/release-20255/#picking-entities\">introduced a new entity picker</a>, which was a big hit! This release takes things further by refining the search experience based on your feedback.</p>\n<p>Even better, that same improved search experience now comes to the area, category, floor, label, user, and device pickers too! They are consistent, fast, and easy to use, no matter what you’re selecting.</p>\n<p>And the device picker? It now has a fresh look to match, complete with manufacturer logos and styling inspired by the entity picker.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new device picker, including the area and integration that provides them.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-06/new-device-picker.png\" />\n<h2>Making sense of Bluetooth</h2>\n<p>Home Assistant has powerful <a href=\"/integrations/bluetooth\">Bluetooth capabilities</a>, and with the use of something like <a href=\"https://esphome.io/projects/?type=bluetooth\">ESPHome Bluetooth proxies</a>, you can extend your Bluetooth network to cover your entire home. This release brings some improvements to the Bluetooth integration that will help you understand your Bluetooth network better.</p>\n<p>The Bluetooth integration now provides a visualization that shows how your Bluetooth devices are connected to your Home Assistant instance, whether that’s directly to your system or through a Bluetooth proxy.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showcasing the new Bluetooth connection graph; Even Bluetooth proxies are shown in the map.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-06/bluetooth-connection-graph.png\" />\n<p>It not only shows the actively connected devices, but also the devices that are in range, but not yet known to Home Assistant. This is a great way to see what devices are around you and where they can be potentially connected.</p>\n<p>Oh! And now that the Bluetooth integration has a sleek new visualization, the <a href=\"/integrations/zha\">Zigbee integration</a>, which already has a similar feature, has been given a visual update. This makes visualizations consistent across Home Assistant.</p>\n<h2>Iterations of the experimental area dashboard</h2>\n<p>In the April release, we introduced a <a href=\"/blog/2025/04/02/release-20254/#a-new-experimental-areas-dashboard\">new experimental Areas dashboard</a>, which automatically generates a ready-to-use dashboard based on the areas you’ve set up in your home. It uses sections and tile cards for a modern, clean, and intuitive look — all built for you in a couple of clicks.</p>\n<p>As this is experimental, it is being continuously iterated on. This release brings some nice changes, based on your feedback, to subtly refine the experience.</p>\n<p>We added a new “Actions” section that includes scripts, automations, and scenes. We also added number entities (and number helpers), button entities (and button helpers), counters, and timer helpers to the “Others” section. This makes it easier to find and manage your automations and scenes in the context of your areas.</p>\n<p>Finally, we renamed the “Entertainment” section to “Media players”. This makes it clearer that this section is specifically for your players, and may not include your DIY arcade machine 👾.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of the new areas dashboard; showcasing the new Actions section.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-06/areas-dashboard.png\" />\n<h2>Deprecating installation methods and 32-bit architectures</h2>\n<p>This release introduces important deprecation announcements, and though they only affect a small percentage of users, it is important that they understand the impacts. We’ve written <a href=\"/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/\">a detailed blog</a> that explains the rationale, timeline, and tips on how to migrate — which I highly suggest reading if you think you’re affected.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Installation Methods</strong>: The <strong>Core</strong> and <strong>Supervised</strong> installation methods are now officially deprecated. These are advanced setups that are only used by a small portion of users, as they involve running Home Assistant in a Python environment or installing the Supervisor on top of your own operating system. Moving forward, we are focusing our support on the more streamlined and maintainable installation methods: <strong>Home Assistant OS</strong> and <strong>Home Assistant Container</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>32-bit Architectures</strong>: Support for legacy 32-bit CPU architectures (<strong>i386</strong>, <strong>armhf</strong>, and <strong>armv7</strong>) is also being deprecated. These architectures are increasingly uncommon and pose challenges for maintaining compatibility and performance.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To assist you during this transition, Home Assistant will now raise a <strong>repair issue</strong> after upgrading if your system is affected by these deprecations. This notification will appear in the repair dashboard, providing information about the deprecation along with guidance on how to migrate to a supported setup.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that while these methods and architectures are deprecated, they will continue to receive support for the next six months, until the release of Home Assistant 2025.12. You can continue to use them after this point, but we would highly recommend migrating. After this 6-month period, they will become unsupported, meaning they will no longer receive updates or official assistance.</p>\n<p>If you don’t receive this repair message, you’re not affected. However, you can double-check using <a href=\"/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/#what-does-deprecated-and-unsupported-mean\">our guide</a> if you’d like. We also have specific information on what becoming deprecated and unsupported <a href=\"/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/#what-does-deprecated-and-unsupported-mean\">means for your installation</a>. Lastly, we have detailed information on <a href=\"/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/#how-to-migrate\">how best to migrate</a> to a supported system.</p>\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

Helpful!</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/integrations/cloud\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> integration will now raise a repair issue when your subscription has expired, helping make sure you’re aware and not caught off guard. Nice one, <a href=\"https://github.com/ludeeus\">@ludeeus</a>!</li>\n<li>More backup improvements! 🎉\n<ul>\n<li>Home Assistant will now raise a repair issue if not all add-ons or folders were successfully backed up. Thanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/emontnemery\">@emontnemery</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/agners\">@agners</a> made it so that when an add-on is auto-updated, a backup is now correctly created as an “add-on”-backup. Great!</li>\n<li>A new automatic backup <a href=\"/integrations/event\">event entity</a> has been added to track automatic backups made by the system. Great addition by <a href=\"https://github.com/mib1185\">@mib1185</a>!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lboue\">@lboue</a> added support for the <a href=\"/integrations/matter\">Matter</a> pump device type. Another one\nadded to the list—awesome!</li>\n<li>The Template integration got a big boost!\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Petro31\">@Petro31</a> added modern-style YAML support for template fans, locks, alarm control panels, vacuums, and covers. So clean!</li>\n<li>You can now create <strong>trigger-based template covers</strong>. Yep, also by <a href=\"https://github.com/Petro31\">@Petro31</a>!</li>\n<li>The <code>trigger_variables</code> option is now supported when using <code>for</code> in a trigger. A small but powerful feature. Thanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/Petro31\">@Petro31</a>!</li>\n<li>New template filters! You can now use <code>from_hex</code>, and <code>base64_encode</code> now supports both bytes and strings. Handy additions from <a href=\"https://github.com/Petro31\">@Petro31</a>!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>New sensor capabilities:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Passific\">@Passific</a> added a new device class and units for <strong>reactive energy</strong>. Nice!</li>\n<li>A new unit for <strong>energy distance (Wh/km)</strong> has been added. Thanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/frenck\">@frenck</a>!</li>\n<li>Sensors now support <strong>mg/m³</strong> as a concentration unit—another nice addition by <a href=\"https://github.com/frenck\">@frenck</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Arnie97\">@Arnie97</a> added support for <strong>liters</strong> as a unit for gas sensors. Much appreciated!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The new <code>recorder.get_statistics</code> action lets you query statistics directly\nfrom the recorder. Powerful stuff, <a href=\"https://github.com/Hypfer\">@Hypfer</a>!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Sidebar improvements</h2>\n<p>If you didn’t know yet, you can actually adjust the contents of your Home Assistant sidebar. You can change the order and show/hide items by pressing and holding the “Home Assistant” text at the top of the sidebar, or by going to your user profile page and selecting “Change the order and hide items from the sidebar”.</p>\n<p>This release brings a couple of much-needed improvements to this feature. When you customize the sidebar, it will now bring up a nice and clean dialog that allows you to drag and drop items to change their order, or hide them by clicking the eye icon next to them.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of the new dialog that can be used to order or hide the items in the sidebar.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-06/sidebar-customization.png\" />\n<p>The biggest improvement is actually found somewhere else! Previously, the customization of the sidebar was only applied to the device you made the changes on; and even more annoying, sometimes it would lose the changes, or it would magically forget your settings on our [mobile companion apps] when you switched between your home network (and thus the internal URL). 🥲</p>\n<p>In this release, this annoyance has been fixed! The sidebar customization is now stored in your user profile, so your personalized layout follows you across all devices you use with Home Assistant!</p>\n<h2>Join/unjoin groups of media players</h2>\n<p>Media players in Home Assistant can provide actions for media players to join or unjoin a group of media players. This is a great way to dynamically control your media players and the groups they are in. However, this feature was somewhat limited, as it could only be used as actions within things like automations or scripts.</p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https://github.com/AlexGustafsson\">@AlexGustafsson</a> changed that! 🎉</p>\n<p>You can now use the media player card to join or unjoin groups of media players. This is a great way to control your media players and their groups directly from the UI.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of the media player card providing controls to group media player with the current used media player.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-06/group-media-players-from-media-player-card.png\" />\n<p>Please note that, you can only join or unjoin groups of media players that support this feature. Unfortunately, not all media players support this, so it might not be available for all your media players.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, amazing contribution Alex! 👏</p>\n<h2>Reset/restore entity IDs</h2>\n<p>You can now restore the ID of an entity to its original value. This is useful if you have renamed an entity and want to revert it back to its original entity ID.</p>\n<p>This feature is available in the entity configuration dialog, where you can now find a “Reset” icon on the entity ID field.

We always strive to have Home Assistant run on almost anything, but sometimes we must make difficult decisions to keep the project moving forward. Though these changes will only affect a small percentage of Home Assistant users, we want to do everything in our power to make this easy for those who may need to migrate.</p>\n<p>Beginning with Home Assistant 2025.6, affected systems will display a notification after updating, indicating that <strong>support will end in six months (with release 2025.12)</strong> and include a recommendation to <a href=\"#how-to-migrate\">migrate to a supported system</a>. In this post, we’ll go into our thinking on these deprecations and our findings after consulting the community on these changes.</p>\n<p>We have deprecated the following installation methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Home Assistant Core</strong> installation method, where you run your system in a Python environment, not to be confused with Container (for example, running your system in Docker).</li>\n<li><strong>Home Assistant’s Supervised</strong> installation method, which involves running your own operating system, then installing the Supervisor and other requirements on top of that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are advanced installation methods, with only a small percentage of the community opting to use them. If you are using these methods, you can continue to do so (you can even continue to update your system), but in six months time, you will no longer be supported, which I’ll explain the impacts of in the next section. References to these installation methods will be removed from our documentation after our next release (2025.6). Going forward <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system\">Home Assistant OS</a> and <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/homeassistant/home-assistant\">Home Assistant Container</a> will become the only supported installation methods.</p>\n<p>In the future, only the currently supported 64-bit architectures (aarch64 and amd64) will be used. The following legacy architectures are being deprecated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>i386</strong> (32-bit x86) is an architecture used by Intel and AMD predominantly before 2003, but some later processors still utilized it (e.g., early Intel Atom models).</li>\n<li><strong>armhf</strong> (32-bit ARM hard-float) was used by very early single-board computers, notably the original Raspberry Pi.</li>\n<li><strong>armv7</strong> (32-bit ARM) was used by a number of early single-board computers, most notably the Raspberry Pi 2.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are one of the few with a system using these architectures, you will receive a notification after updating to 2025.6, and it will describe how to migrate your system. In six months, your system will become unsupported and will no longer receive updates.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#check-if-youre-affected\">Check our guide to see if your current Home Assistant installation is affected.</a><!--more--></p>\n<h2>What does deprecated and unsupported mean</h2>\n<p>In the simplest terms, deprecation is where you stop recommending a certain feature to users as you intend to remove it soon. As we deprecated the Core and Supervised installations methods today, that means we are now working to remove all references to them from our documentation. The goal is to guide new users towards installation methods we plan to support long term, and discourage the use of those that are being phased out.</p>\n<p>Even though they are being deprecated, we are committing to support them for a further six months (until release 2025.12), giving existing users time to migrate to Home Assistant OS or Container. During this time we will ensure these installation types keep functioning as normal during the deprecation period. However, after those six months have elapsed, these methods will become unsupported, which means issue reports will no longer be accepted. As these installation methods are used for the development of Home Assistant, it will still be technically possible to update them. We still would recommend migrating to a supported method, but that’s your choice.</p>\n<p>As i386, armhf, and armv7 architectures have also been deprecated, we are currently removing references to them from our documentation. More importantly, they will also be subject to a six-month support window. After that support ends (from release 2025.12 onwards), we will no longer build or release distributions or containers targeting these platforms. This will mean that in six months’ time, there will be no more updates for these systems, and if users encounter issues, they will no longer be able to ask for support from Home Assistant maintainers.</p>\n<h2>Why we made this decision</h2>\n<h3>Core and Supervised</h3>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-05-deprecation/analytics.png' alt=\"OS and Container represent the vast majority of installation methods\">From our <a href=\"https://analytics.home-assistant.io/\">opt-in analytics</a></p>\n<p>The Core and Supervised installation methods are not only complex for users to install and maintain — they’re also challenging for the Home Assistant team to support. In the past, there were compelling reasons, outside Home Assistant development, to run these installation methods, but for most people those reasons are disappearing. Home Assistant OS is very capable with a rich ecosystem of add-ons, while also being easy to run in a virtual machine. Container adoption has become mainstream, now being widely available along with systems having more resources to run them. Steadily, we’ve seen year-on-year reductions in the percentage of Core and Supervised installations (currently standing at 2.5% and 3.3% respectively).</p>\n<p>As Core and Supervised are more complex to maintain, they generate more issues that are more difficult to solve. This complexity places a disproportionate burden on our community-driven support system, where volunteers generously give their time to help others. It also takes time away from assisting the vast majority of users who are on the simpler to maintain installation methods. Along with this, new users could sometimes be swayed into running Core or Supervised, and have a bad experience that could cause them to give up on the best way to automate their home. By focusing our support and documentation on OS and Container methods, we can greatly improve the onboarding experience and ensure a smoother start for new users.</p>\n<h3>Legacy 32-bit architectures</h3>\n<p>Though Home Assistant is very lean and can run great on older or low-spec hardware, the architectures we’re deprecating are definitely on the leaner side of the spectrum. That probably explains why we see such low usage figures, with i386 and armhf architectures representing less than 0.5% of installations each, and armv7 at only 0.95% of installations. More than half of Home Assistant systems using armv7 have hardware that is capable of running 64-bit operating systems, like Raspberry Pi 3 and 4. This hardware can actually upgrade and migrate to a supported 64-bit version of our Home Assistant Operating System</p>\n<p>The broader software and hardware industries have also shifted away from these older 32-bit systems. Most have adopted 64-bit architectures such as amd64 and aarch64, and we are seeing more projects we depend on no longer supporting these 32-bit architectures. There have already been several instances where keeping support for these architectures has held back the development of new features.</p>\n<h2>Your feedback</h2>\n<p>For any major change, it is our goal to make sure the community guides this decision-making. When our maintainers initially proposed these deprecations, we shared this plan with the community (in our forum, GitHub, Discord, Reddit, and other social channels), using it to gather feedback. It was a constructive, civil discussion, and we learned a couple of interesting things that have helped us move this decision forward.</p>\n<p>First, our current wording is confusing to the community. Core and Supervisor are components of Home Assistant OS, but are also similar—or the same—as the names of installation methods, which is not super clear for new users. We also found these installation methods being used in ways we never expected, and there are a good number of people who were already running Home Assistant in custom and unsupported ways, not even realizing they were unsupported.</p>\n<p>Many of those impacted asked for better guidance on how to migrate. A good number were unaware of our expansion of backup and restore features to all installation methods, significantly smoothing their transition to a new platform.</p>\n<h2>Check if you’re affected</h2>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-05-deprecation/system-information.png' alt=\"what the system information dialog looks like\">The blue arrow shows your installation type, and the red arrow displays the architecture.</p>\n<p>If you are unsure which <strong>installation method</strong> you are running:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/system_health/\">this link</a> OR Navigate to <em><strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Repairs</strong></em>, select the three-dotted menu in the top right corner, and select <em><strong>System information</strong></em>.</li>\n<li>Check the Installation type field. If you are running Home Assistant OS, or Container, you are fine as the installation method deprecation doesn’t apply to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/system_health/\">same window</a>, you can find the <strong>architecture</strong> as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The CPU architecture field will tell you exactly which architecture you are using. If you are seeing aarch64 or x86_64 here, you are fine as the architecture deprecation doesn’t apply to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to migrate</h2>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-05-deprecation/methods.png' alt=\"Installation methods and their functionality\">Green are staying, and red are deprecated.</p>\n<p>If it’s been a while since you’ve migrated Home Assistant systems, a lot has improved over the past several years. Switching systems is as easy as <a href=\"/common-tasks/general/#backups\">making a backup</a>, downloading it, and <a href=\"/common-tasks/general/#restoring-a-backup\">restoring</a> it during the initialization of your new system (Home Assistant Cloud subscribers using off-site backups can restore <a href=\"/blog/2025/04/02/release-20254/#onboarding-with-a-home-assistant-cloud-backup\">with just their password</a>). Every Home Assistant installation method now has backups, and you can restore backups from any method onto another regardless of the differences in architecture. In many cases, very little needs to be done once the restore is successful (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1kdip17/are_you_kidding_me/\">to the dismay of tinkerers online</a>). Our documentation has a full list of guides on <a href=\"/installation/\">how to install Home Assistant on different hardware</a>.</p>\n<p>Before you think about migrating to a different installation method, you can always choose to stick with what you have. Just because it becomes unsupported by the Home Assistant project, it doesn’t mean you can’t keep running it like you do today. That choice is up to you.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Need</th>\n<th>Currently using</th>\n<th>Migrate to</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Home Assistant with add-ons</td>\n<td>Supervised</td>\n<td>Home Assistant OS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A system without Home Assistant OS support</td>\n<td>Supervised</td>\n<td>Container (many add-ons can be run as containers alongside Home Assistant)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Full control of the host system</td>\n<td>Supervised</td>\n<td>Run Home Assistant OS in a VM, or Container (alongside add-on containers)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lightweight solution</td>\n<td>Core</td>\n<td>Container</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>For <strong>Home Assistant Core</strong> users, the closest alternative is Home Assistant Container, which is most commonly used with Docker. If you can dedicate a device exclusively to Home Assistant, the recommended installation method is Home Assistant OS, which gives an appliance-like setup.</p>\n<p>For <strong>Home Assistant Supervised</strong> users, we recommend migrating to Home Assistant OS—it supports everything Supervised does, including add-ons. If you want more control over the OS, you can also run Home Assistant OS in a virtual machine, like with Proxmox, or go the Home Assistant Container path alternatively.</p>\n<p>For <strong>deprecated architectures</strong>, there is generally no supported migration path using your existing hardware. You will therefore need to find alternative hardware compatible with Home Assistant OS or Container. Second-hand single-board computers and recycled small-form-factor office machines are affordable and sustainable options. In some cases, your system may be running a 32-bit operating system, but is capable of running a 64-bit one (Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 are examples of systems often running a 32-bit OS despite being capable of running 64-bit). In this case, you will need to install a 64-bit capable operating system and restore Home Assistant on that system.</p>\n<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>If Home Assistant Core is used for development, and part of the developer docs, why not just offer it to end-users?</strong></em><br />\nThis is not just about technical viability, it is also about helping and supporting people with their issues, problems, and questions, in our forums and chat. Having these options available to less technical people leads to support queries, and if they have a bad first experience that reflects poorly on the project. Users are free to continue running their systems the way they would like.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>No support for Core or Supervised—can I still use them?</strong></em><br />\nYou can still use them even if we no longer support them. There are many users running Home Assistant in all kinds of unofficial ways. This change just means we are removing it from our end-user documentation and will no longer recommend using these installation methods from an official standpoint.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>Will the developer documentation on these things remain?</strong></em><br />\nYes, those will remain. The developer documentation for running Home Assistant’s Core Python application directly in a Python virtual environment will remain. This is how we develop. This proposal is about removing end-user documentation and support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>Can I start maintaining these installation methods?</strong></em><br />\nWhile maintaining these methods will require effort, the community is free to move documentation and code to new independent projects. Our maintainers will no longer accept issues or provide end-user documentation, but that shouldn’t stop anyone passionate about them from continuing to run them, or helping others to do the same.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>Can I reproduce any of the installations you offer?</strong></em><br />\nYes, of course! All our pipelines are open source and transparent, you can always recreate any of our pipelines and release artifacts; either automated or manual.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>Is this the first step towards making Home Assistant closed source/proprietary/commercial?</strong></em><br />\nNo, that is impossible. Home Assistant will always remain open source. Home Assistant is owned by the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a>, a Swiss non-profit foundation that is audited and governed, and—by law—bound by its mission. This means it will always be open source and cannot be bought or sold.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

It marked a new chapter for Home Assistant: one where we made our direction clear, set ambitious goals, and invited the whole community along for the ride.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/\">2024</a>, we focused on building a smart home that has a high Home Approval Factor: helping both the maintainer and residents of the smart home unlock more value from Home Assistant without needing to be an expert. This was done by improving the touchpoints that all members of the household will interact with, such as automations, dashboards, and voice interactions, while maintaining the power and depth of the platform for our power users and admins.</p>\n<p>The real challenge lay in building a roadmap from scratch. That meant not only poring through and prioritizing every single feature request, but also increasing transparency and building trust in the roadmap within our organization and our community as a beacon that can help guide the development of the project. Thanks to the feedback, energy, and contributions from our global community, we’ve made huge strides. In the past year, we tackled some of the biggest pain points, such as drag-and-drop dashboard improvements, automation grouping, standard voice assistant hardware, better automated backups, and more.</p>\n<p>Now, in 2025, we are ready to lay the groundwork for the next big step forward: Making Home Assistant <em>truly smart</em> through our collective effort and intelligence.</p>\n<h2>The smart home administrator as an inventor</h2>\n<p>Home Approval Factor means that a successful smart home isn’t just great for the person who set it up, but for everyone who lives there. Whether it’s your partner, kids, or roommates, we want Home Assistant to feel intuitive and supportive for the whole household.</p>\n<p>In some ways, being a smart home administrator is like being an inventor (or, as we would say, a product manager). To be a great inventor, you need to understand your users. What are their needs? What solutions can you invent to solve their problems? How do you know you solved their problems? Can you improve upon the solution?</p>\n<p>Home Assistant provides all the building blocks for our administrators to build whatever they want and let their imaginations run wild, and better yet, it’s easier than ever with the improvements we made last year! However, that’s also the curse of a blank slate. Inventing fun and hyper-personalized solutions for niche problems is a major appeal of Home Assistant, but sometimes, maintenance of a smart home can be a chore — not every single problem requires reinventing the wheel.</p>\n<p>The reality today is that, according to our <a href=\"/blog/2025/04/16/state-of-the-open-home-recap/#research\">community survey</a>, just 46% of partners and only 27% of children of long-time Home Assistant users are directly interacting with Home Assistant. That’s a big gap, and it highlights a broader challenge: Even the most experienced smart home administrators don’t always have the complete picture of their household’s needs. They may not realize what would help until something goes wrong. And it’s unreasonable to expect everyone to be an expert in everything — from automations to dashboards to onboarding new users.</p>\n<h2>From shared wisdom to collective intelligence</h2>\n<p class='img'><img alt=\"wisdom spread across social, chats, and videos\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/shared-wisdom.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Right now, if a smart home admin wants to improve their setup, they have to go hunting—through our community forums, GitHub repos, Reddit threads, YouTube videos, Discord chats… you name it—trying to find tips and tricks that apply to their specific case. You share incredible wisdom with each other every day, but much of it is scattered, short-lived, or hard to apply without lots of customization.</p>\n<p>We believe it’s time for a smarter system.</p>\n<p>What if Home Assistant could learn from our community’s best ideas and use that knowledge to proactively suggest improvements? What if it could guide users based on what others have done in similar situations? That’s the vision we’re working toward: using collective intelligence to power a truly smart home.</p>\n<p class='img'><img alt=\"organized shared wisdom is collective intelligence\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/collective-intelligence.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>To get there, Home Assistant needs to <em>understand</em> what’s in the home. Inside each home, there are the people, the spaces, and the devices. This year, we will start with helping Home Assistant understand devices in terms of (1) <strong>context</strong>: what each device is and how it is used, and (2) <strong>information</strong>: every device that works with Home Assistant and how it is supported.</p>\n<h2>Putting Devices in Context</h2>\n<p>Today, most devices in Home Assistant show up as a bundle of entities: a temperature sensor here, a switch there. This is by design — we want to provide the ultimate flexibility in configuring your system, and will continue to do so. However, it is not without disadvantages.</p>\n<p class='img'><img alt=\"Fridge as a series of entities\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/devices-without-context.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>For example, we don’t always know that those entities together form, say, a fridge, which is essentially a mini house of its own: It may have temperature sensors, a door sensor, a light, and so on, but Home Assistant cannot assume them as any other sensors or lights within a room. Without that context, Home Assistant can’t do much beyond letting users build their own dashboards and automations from scratch.</p>\n<p>As you add more devices, entities pile up, and Home Assistant starts to lose the thread of what’s actually in the home. Your smart home should become more powerful as you add more devices, but at the cost of the difficulty of maintaining them also increasing exponentially.</p>\n<p>When we <strong>put devices in context</strong>, everything changes. A fridge becomes more than a list of entities — it becomes an actual device that can have a dedicated dashboard, default automations, and contextual voice commands.</p>\n<p class='img'><img alt=\"Dashboards, Automation and Voice in context\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/device-context.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Here’s how context unlocks a more streamlined experience across the platform:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Voice:</strong> Assist can currently source the right sensor if it knows the area of the device. In the future, we can also intelligently exclude irrelevant sensors from a voice query. For example, “What’s the temperature in the kitchen?” shouldn’t return the freezer’s internal temperature.</li>\n<li><strong>Dashboards:</strong> Integrations can provide customized cards and dashboards right from the start, providing a much more streamlined experience. For example, we can provide a fridge dashboard. It works with other devices, too. Imagine a car dashboard or a 3D printer dashboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Automations:</strong> By understanding what devices a user has and how they are commonly used, we can intelligently suggest automations created by our community. For example, “fridge door left open” or “fridge water leakage” alerts can be provided without building them manually from scratch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This will be a core architectural change that will be proposed and discussed in the coming months. We’re building on what our contributors already share in integrations: knowledge about how devices are structured and how they should behave. My hope is that this will provide the framework for our contributors to contribute dashboards and automation blueprints to our code in exciting new ways.</p>\n<h2>Introducing the Device Database</h2>\n<p>To make all this work, we also need a centralized, structured place to store and share device knowledge. That’s where the Device Database—a brand new project from the Open Home Foundation—comes in.</p>\n<p>Think of it as a source of truth created, curated, and validated by the community. A place where we gather everything from metadata (like power usage or infrared codes) to factual information (setup instructions such as how to add or reset a device) to real-world setup insights and community creations (such as automation examples). It will contain information users intentionally submit to the database, nothing will be collected automatically without your explicit consent.</p>\n<p>It’s more than just having all device documentation in one place. We want to universalize all our collective experiences about devices in one place, which is more accessible, centralized, and structured than online websites and chat rooms.</p>\n<p>With the Device Database, users both old and new can easily make well-informed choices and pick the best Home Assistant-compatible devices for them based on real usage experiences, allowing them to easily make decisions based on open home values — privacy, choice, and sustainability.</p>\n<p>The data will be used and cross-referenced in Home Assistant and other Open Home Foundation projects, and acts as the backbone of their integrations. For example, a future infrared integration can hypothetically benefit from having access to readily available infrared codes from the database.</p>\n<p class='img'><img alt=\"Protocols, device database, feeding choice\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/working-together.png\"/></p>\n<p>This isn’t something we can build alone. We’re relying on the strength of our global community to turn this vision into reality, and we’re backing it up with our infrastructure, engineering efforts, and partnerships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a> is here to provide the framework to help us collect and collaborate on knowledge easily and safely.</li>\n<li>We’re working with <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/\">Nabu Casa</a>—our commercial partner—to create the most reliable hardware antennas that support more open protocols, such as Z-Wave, Zigbee, Bluetooth, and more, to expand the Home Assistant ecosystem.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://works-with.home-assistant.io/\">Works with Home Assistant program</a> is being strengthened to make it easier to find trusted, high-quality devices for the platform, as you may have witnessed with the <a href=\"/blog/categories/works-with-home-assistant/\">numerous new partners</a> joining in the past few months.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The result? A system where no admin has to figure everything out in isolation on their own. Home Assistant can suggest, guide, adapt, and point users in the right direction, by drawing from the collective intelligence of the community (instead of scraping user data involuntarily like what Big Tech does).</p>\n<h2>And that’s not all for this year!</h2>\n<p class='img'><img alt=\"Devices, Automations, Dashboards, Voice & Music, Frontend\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/roadmap-2025.png\"/></p>\n<p>While device context and the Device Database are the major themes of this year’s roadmap, it doesn’t mean that we are dropping everything else that does not fit. We’re continuing work on other parts of the product experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete revamp of our automation triggers and conditions to make them both easier to use and more powerful.</li>\n<li>A navigation and design system overhaul to improve feature discovery.</li>\n<li>Continued improvements to make dashboards easier to use out of the box, including a new default dashboard and more.</li>\n<li>Enhanced privacy controls for users, guests, and public access (Yes, I am aware of that.)</li>\n<li>Easier setup for Music Assistant.</li>\n<li>Make Assist more conversational, such as the ability to confirm and clarify a query.</li>\n<li>Continued explorations in using LLMs to improve the overall user experience beyond voice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the meantime, we are working on making our roadmap more publicly accessible, so that you can discuss and track our progress with us! Stay tuned.</p>\n<h2>Laying the Groundwork for a Truly Smart Home</h2>\n<p>This roadmap isn’t about the flashy latest tech fad (what is it now anyway?) or abstract features. It’s about creating the enduring foundation to allow our community to build something greater than all of us together: a smart home platform that learns, grows, and adapts — with full respect for privacy, choice, and sustainability.</p>\n<p>The central theme of the roadmap is that making Home Assistant smarter starts with understanding context, such as knowing what devices are and how they’re used, and we will use this collective intelligence to supercharge the main pillars of the user experience — automations, voice, and dashboards.</p>\n<p>We’re making maintenance of a smart home easier, by making it less like a mandatory chore while still keeping the fun of tinkering (say, you wanna go wild on YAML), and by creating tools to help admins solve problems they don’t even know they have yet. We believe that, as our advanced users continue to tinker with their systems, their creations and discoveries will also benefit and elevate every user’s smart home.</p>\n<p>We can’t wait to work on these initiatives for the rest of this year! Let’s build it together! 🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏼‍🚀👨🏼‍🚀</p>\n<p>- <a href=\"https://github.com/Madelena\">Madelena</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jlpouffier\">JLo</a>, &amp; <a href=\"https://github.com/laupalombi\">Laura</a></p>\n",

In the <a href=\"/blog/2025/02/05/release-20252/#iterating-on-backups\">February release</a>,\nwe did an iteration based on your feedback. In this release, we dedicated even more\ntime to iterate and improve backups even further.</p>\n<p>Let’s dive in!</p>\n<h3>Per location backup retention policy settings</h3>\n<p>This release adds a much-requested feature: the ability to set a backup retention\npolicy per location. This is particularly useful if you have multiple backup\nlocations configured in Home Assistant.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the backup retention policy settings for the Microsoft OneDrive integration.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05/backups-retention-per-location.png\" />\n<p>It might be that one of your backup locations has more storage space than\nanother, or that you want to keep more backups in one location than another.\nFor example, maybe you have space to store the last 3 backups in your Google\nDrive, but you want to keep 25 backups on your local NAS server.</p>\n<h3>Backup before upgrading the Home Assistant Operating System</h3>\n<p>Updating the Home Assistant Operating System is as easy as clicking a button. And while the upgrade process has\na fallback mechanism in case the upgrade process fails, it is always a good\nidea to have a recent backup in multiple locations before you start the upgrade process.</p>\n<p>To help you with that, the update dialog for the Home Assistant Operating System\nnow includes the option to create a backup before starting the upgrade process. Selecting this will create a backup that follows the same settings as your automatic backups (and if you don’t have that configured yet, it will just backup your settings, history, and add-ons), uploading this to all enabled backup locations before starting the upgrade process.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the Home Assistant Operating System update dialog, which has a new toggle that asks you if you want to backup before upgrading.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05/backup-before-upgrade-home-assistant-operating-system.png\" />\n<p>This way, you can be sure that you have a backup of your system before\nupgrading, even if something goes wrong beyond the safeguards of the\noperating system upgrade.</p>\n<h3>Set the default backup preference for upgrades</h3>\n<p>The above option to backup before upgrade is great, but the feedback on the\ntoggle to create a backup before upgrade is mixed. Some of you prefer to always\nbackup before upgrading, while others rely on their scheduled backups and don’t\nwant to be bothered with the backup process whenever they upgrade a part\nof Home Assistant.</p>\n<p>To please both groups, we have added a new setting to the backup settings page\nto set the default behavior for the backup before upgrade toggle.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the backup before upgrade toggle preference in the backup settings.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05/backups-select-preference-backup-before-update.png\" />\n<p>When you set the option to “Backup before upgrade”, the toggle will be enabled\nby default, otherwise it will default to disabled. There is an additional\noption to set this behavior for add-ons as well, so you can tweak it to your\nliking.</p>\n<h3>Waiting for the backup to finish on restarts</h3>\n<p>Another small but important improvement is that if you initiate a restart of Home Assistant while a backup is in progress, your system will wait for the backup to finish before restarting.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing Home Assistant waiting for backup to finish before restarting.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05/backups-prevents-restart-when-in-progress.png\" />\n<p>This prevents the unintended situation where a backup is in progress, and you\nabort the process by restarting Home Assistant.</p>\n<h2>Lots of new text-to-speech voice variants for Home Assistant Cloud subscribers</h2>\n<p>If you are subscribed to <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com\">Home Assistant Cloud</a>, you\nnot only get <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/config/backups/\">backup storage included</a>,\nbut you also get access to the most speedy, super accurate <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/config/tts/\">text-to-speech</a>\navailable. If you haven’t tried it yet, now is the perfect time to sign up for the 30-day trial!</p>\n<p>This release extends the already staggering number of text-to-speech voices,\nbut also now includes voice variants and styles. This means that you can\nnow choose between different voice styles and tones, such as “friendly”,\n“angry”, “sad”, “whisper”, etc., allowing you to customize your announcements to\nfit the mood and context of the situation.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a glimpse of the new voice variants for available for Home Assistant Cloud subscribers.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05/new-voice-variants-for-home-assistant-cloud.png\" />\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<div class=\"details-block\">\n  <details class='details-block-item'>\n    <summary class='details-block-title'>\n      <span>Overview of new voice options</span>\n      <div class='details-block-arrow'>\n      <svg class=\"down\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M7.41,8.58L12,13.17L16.59,8.58L18,10L12,16L6,10L7.41,8.58Z\" /></svg>\n      <svg class=\"up\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M7.41,15.41L12,10.83L16.59,15.41L18,14L12,8L6,14L7.41,15.41Z\" /></svg>\n      </div>\n    </summary>\n    <div class='details-block-content' id=\"content_0\">\n<p>We’ve expanded our voice selection dramatically, with some languages seeing huge increases in available options:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Language</th>\n<th>Old choices</th>\n<th>New choices</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Assamese (India) <strong>new</strong></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>German (Germany)</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>English (United Kingdom)</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>English (India)</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>English (United States)</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>132</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spanish (Spain)</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spanish (Mexico)</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>23</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>French (Canada)</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>French (France)</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>22</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hindi (India)</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Italian (Italy)</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>24</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inuktitut (Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics, Canada) <strong>new</strong></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inuktitut (Latin, Canada) <strong>new</strong></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Japanese (Japan)</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Korean (Korea)</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oriya (India) <strong>new</strong></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Punjabi (India) <strong>new</strong></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Portuguese (Brazil)</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Serbian (Latin, Serbia) <strong>new</strong></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chinese (China)</td>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>142</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n  </details>\n</div>\n<h2>Picking entities</h2>\n<p>We are working on improving the context of things shown in the UI. This is to\nensure you always know which device or entity you are looking at, no matter\nwhere you are in the Home Assistant interface.</p>\n<p>In the last release, we already had a small noteworthy change regarding this.\nWe added the device and area to the entity information dialogs, so you always\nknow exactly which entity you are viewing.</p>\n<p>In this release, we have improved the context provided within the entity pickers in our UI. This is the dropdown you see when you select an entity in, for example, a card, automation,\nor script. This picker will now show the device and area name as well!</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new entity pickers, providing more context and improves search capabilities.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05/improved-entity-picker.png\" />\n<p>This enhancement gradually eliminates the need for you to manually rename\nentities or devices to include location information—giving you a much better\nout-of-the-box experience with less setup work.</p>\n<p>Not only has the visual appearance of the picker improved, but the search\nfunctionality has been completely overhauled too! 🔎 Finding the exact entity\nyou’re looking for is now significantly easier thanks to a smarter search\nalgorithm and the addition of more contextual information in the matching\nprocess.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-tip\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:lightbulb-outline'></iconify-icon> Tip</p>\n  <div class=\"alert-content\">\n<p><strong>You might notice that the entity ID isn’t shown in the picker anymore!</strong></p>\n<p>We think we are at a point where you may solely rely on the UI and the\nentity ID is not needed anymore. However, if you <strong>do prefer</strong> to see the\nentity ID in this drop down, <strong>you can enable it</strong> in your profile settings.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the improved entity picker with the show entity ID in entity picker option enabled in my user profile.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05/improved-entity-picker-with-entity-ids.png\" />\n<p>To do so, select your profile picture in the bottom left corner of the\nHome Assistant UI, and under <strong><a href='https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/profile' class='my' target='_blank'>User settings</a></strong> enable\nthe <strong>Display entity IDs in picker</strong> option.</p>\n<p><a href='https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/profile' class='my badge' target='_blank'><img src='https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/profile.svg' /></a></p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2>Z-Wave Long Range support and improved Smart Start</h2>\n<p>We are providing quite a few enhancements to the Z-Wave integration and\nexperience in this release. Our commercial partner <a href=\"https://nabucasa.com\">Nabu Casa</a>\nis working on a not-so-secret Z-Wave antenna, and we want to ensure that\nHome Assistant is ready for it by providing the best user experience\npossible.</p>\n<p>This release, we improved the whole experience in setting up new Z-Wave devices,\nincluding improved support for setting up new Z-Wave devices by scanning the\nSmart Start QR code.</p>\n<p>Z-Wave Smart Start QR scanning now works natively in our <a href=\"https://companion.home-assistant.io/\">mobile companion apps</a>,\nremoving browser limitations. Added devices are immediately visible in\nHome Assistant, even if the device is not yet powered on. Once powered on or rebooted, the\ndevice will automatically be added to your Z-Wave network.</p>\n<p>The most exciting part of this release is the addition of Z-Wave Long Range\nsupport. This is a new Z-Wave technology that allows devices to communicate\nover much longer distances than traditional Z-Wave devices. This is especially\nuseful if you have a specific device that needs to be placed far away,\nfor example, a contact sensor on a gate or mailbox up your driveway.</p>\n<p class='img'>\n<img alt=\"Screenshot showing adding a Z-Wave device with Long Range support.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05/zwave-long-range.png\" />\nYou can choose if you want to add the Z-Wave device to the existing mesh network\nor connect it directly using Long Range.\n</p>\n<p>After scanning the QR code of a Long Range capable device, you will get the\noption to either add it to the existing mesh network or connect it directly\nusing Long Range. Both have pros and cons, mesh networking is recommended for\nmost devices, but if you have a device that needs to be placed far away,\nLong Range might be the better option.</p>\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

No? Well… if you are curious to learn, after upgrading, press\n<code>?</code> anywhere in the UI to see a list of all available keyboard shortcuts.\nNice addition <a href=\"https://github.com/jpbede\">@jpbede</a>!</li>\n<li>Support for the <a href=\"/integrations/matter\">Matter</a> 1.4 water heater device type has been added.\nThanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/lboue\">@lboue</a>!</li>\n<li>When setting up a new device in Home Assistant, you can now directly name\nit during the setup process. Nice! Thanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/bramkragten\">@bramkragten</a>!</li>\n<li>Media players now have an action to search using the <code>media_player.search_media</code>\naction. Thanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/zweckj\">@zweckj</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/piitaya\">@piitaya</a> added a <code>device_name</code> template function to get the name of a device\nin Home Assistant. Cool!</li>\n<li>The <code>floor_id</code> and <code>area_id</code> template methods have been enhanced by <a href=\"https://github.com/formatBCE\">@formatBCE</a>\nto also look for floors or area aliases. Awesome!</li>\n<li>We now have support for trigger-based <a href=\"/integrations/template/\">template entities</a> for switches and\nlights. Amazing work <a href=\"https://github.com/Petro31\">@Petro31</a>!</li>\n<li>Support for modern YAML-syntax was also added to the cover <a href=\"/integrations/template/\">template entities</a>\nby <a href=\"https://github.com/Petro31\">@Petro31</a>. Nice!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/frenck\">@frenck</a> added support for detecting Home Assistant Container installation\ntypes not running in host networking mode. This is important for\nHome Assistant to function properly. It raises a repair issue if it detects\nthis.</li>\n<li>A long-standing issue with iOS and the dropdown items in our user interface\nhas been fixed! No longer will it select the wrong item when you tap on it\nwhile the dropdown is open and the keyboard is shown.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Badges on the dashboard can now be wrapped or scrolled</h2>\n<p>A cool little new feature for dashboards landed this release, which we don’t\nwant to rush past unnoticed. The behavior of the badges in the header of a\ndashboard view can now be configured to either wrap or scroll.</p>\n<p>Wrap was the original and is still the default behavior, but if you have a lot\nof badges and primarily use a mobile device, scrolling might be a better option\nfor you.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the behavior options for the badges shown in the header of a dashboard view: Either scroll or wrap.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05/dashboards-header-badges-behavior.png\" />\n<h2>Improved UI experience when using templates in automations &amp; scripts</h2>\n<p>If you are a power-user, using templates in your automations and script, you\nare probably familiar with the fact that the UI falls back to using YAML for\nany action block that contains a template.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a> to the rescue! He has worked on a solution to improve this\nexperience.</p>\n<p>So, instead of falling back to pure YAML for the whole block, it now only\nfalls back to a code editor for fields containing an action template. This\nmeans the rest of the UI—for all other action fields—remains intact and you\ncan still use the UI to edit the rest.</p>\n<p>As you can see in this screenshot below, the brightness is set using a template,\nwhich is no problem, as the rest of the action is still editable in the UI.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the automation improvements made, when using templates keeping the rest of the UI available in those cases.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05/template-automation-improvement.png\" />\n<p>This is a great improvement for power users, as it allows you to use the UI\nfor most of the automation or script, while still being able to use templates\nwhere needed. It also makes it easier to understand the automation or script,\nas you can see the context of the template in the UI.</p>\n<p>Great improvement there <a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a>! 🙌</p>\n<h2>Pasting automations and scripts YAML directly into the UI</h2>\n<p>Found this great automation or script example in our documentation or the\n<a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/\">community forums</a>, but it is shared in\nYAML format? No problem! You can now paste the YAML directly into the UI.</p>\n<p>When you are editing an automation, you can now simply paste the YAML directly\ninto the UI editor and it will be converted to the UI format. This is regardless of\nwhether the pasted example is a full-blown automation or just a single trigger,\ncondition, or action.</p>\n<p><lite-youtube videoid=\"RRl-G3Igo4E\" videotitle=\"Copy & paste YAML directly into the UI!\"></lite-youtube></p>\n<p>An amazing quality of life improvement, contributed by <a href=\"https://github.com/jpbede\">@jpbede</a>! Thank you! 🙌</p>\n<h2>Discover what Home Assistant is discovering</h2>\n<p>Home Assistant is constantly scanning your network for new devices and\nintegrations using all sorts of discovery protocols. This greatly improves your\nexperience, as it allows you to easily add new devices to your Home\nAssistant installation.</p>\n<p>However, sometimes, you might want to know what Home Assistant is seeing\nor wonder why a certain device is not being discovered. To help with that\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bdraco\">@bdraco</a> added browsing tools for the DHCP, mDNS/ZeroConf, and UPnP/SSDP that\nallow you to see what Home Assistant is seeing. It is quite technical, but\nit is a great way to see what is going on in your network.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of the new ZeroConf/mDNS browser, showing the internal the discovery process of Home Assistant.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-05/discovery-browsers.png\" />\n<p>You can find these new tools in <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Network</strong>. At the\nbottom of that page, you will find the ability to browse all the things\nHome Assistant is seeing on your network for each of the discovery protocols.</p>\n<h2>Patch releases</h2>\n<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.5 in May.\nThese patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch\nrelease every Friday.</p>\n<h3>2025.5.1 - May 9</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix Z-Wave restore nvm command to wait for driver ready (<a href=\"https://github.com/MartinHjelmare\">@MartinHjelmare</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/144413\">#144413</a>)</li>\n<li>fix homekit air purifier temperature sensor to convert unit (<a href=\"https://github.com/tamwahba\">@tamwahba</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/144435\">#144435</a>)</li>\n<li>Add LAP-V102S-AUSR to VeSync (<a href=\"https://github.com/DukeChocula\">@DukeChocula</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/144437\">#144437</a>)</li>\n<li>Bump pylamarzocco to 2.0.1 (<a href=\"https://github.com/zweckj\">@zweckj</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/144454\">#144454</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix Z-Wave reset accumulated values button entity category (<a href=\"https://github.com/MartinHjelmare\">@MartinHjelmare</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/144459\">#144459</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix point import error (<a href=\"https://github.com/fredrike\">@fredrike</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/144462\">#144462</a>)</li>\n<li>Ignore Fronius Gen24 firmware 1.35.4-1 SSL verification issue (<a href=\"https://github.com/farmio\">@farmio</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/144463\">#144463</a>)</li>\n<li>Don’t encrypt or decrypt unknown files in backup archives (<a href=\"https://github.com/emontnemery\">@emontnemery</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/144495\">#144495</a>)</li>\n<li>Bump forecast-solar to 4.2.0 (<a href=\"https://github.com/bdraco\">@bdraco</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/144502\">#144502</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix removing of smarthome templates on startup of AVM Fritz!SmartHome integration (<a href=\"https://github.com/mib1185\">@mib1185</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/144506\">#144506</a>)</li>\n<li>Bump aiodns to 3.4.0 (<a href=\"https://github.com/bdraco\">@bdraco</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/144511\">#144511</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix statistics coordinator subscription for lamarzocco (<a href=\"https://github.com/zweckj\">@zweckj</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/144541\">#144541</a>)</li>\n<li>Update frontend to 20250509.0 (<a href=\"https://github.com/bramkragten\">@bramkragten</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/144549\">#144549</a>)</li>\n<li>Reolink clean device registry mac (<a href=\"https://github.com/starkillerOG\">@starkillerOG</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/144554\">#144554</a>)</li>\n<li>Prevent errors during cleaning of connections/identifiers in device registry (<a href=\"https://github.com/starkillerOG\">@starkillerOG</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/144558\">#144558</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2025.5.2 - May 16</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow dns hostnames to be retained for SMLIGHT user flow.

Eve is at the forefront of the Matter standard and has some great Matter devices focused on local control and privacy in the home. They’re bringing a variety of devices to the program, including a couple of firsts!</p>\n<h2>Eve of a New Day for the Open Home</h2>\n<p>Eve, based in Germany and part of ABB, is known for making high-quality smart home devices. They’ve been an early proponent of Matter, as it really aligns with their philosophy of local and private control. In their own words, <em>“No Eve cloud, no registration and no tracking so your data won’t get exposed. Local intelligence and direct communication between Eve devices and smartphones or hubs without cloud dependency.”</em><!--more--></p>\n<p>Eve has had a wide range of devices Works with Home Assistant certified, all of which connect directly to Home Assistant via Matter. If you’re not aware, Matter is an open smart home standard that allows for local control by directly connecting devices to Home Assistant, keeping your smart home data in your home. In case you missed it, Home Assistant is now <a href=\"/blog/2025/03/10/matter-certification/\">Matter Certified</a>!</p>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-eve/eve-weather.jpg' alt=\"Eve Weather\"/>Built for outdoor weather sensing, Matter, and a cool segmented LCD display---sign me up</p>\n<p>Matter can connect to devices over Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks, but it can also use <a href=\"/integrations/thread/\">Thread</a>, which every Eve device being certified today uses. Thread devices can be directly connected to Home Assistant using a device like the <a href=\"/connectzbt1\">Connect ZBT-1</a>, or can be connected to Home Assistant via an existing hub (Thread Border Router) you may already have from another <a href=\"/integrations/thread#google\">smart home ecosystem</a>. Thread was designed around efficiency and is excellent for low-powered or battery-powered devices. Also, if your smart home balloons up to a hundred devices (or more 😅), you won’t overwhelm your Wi-Fi router, as Thread operates independently.</p>\n<p>Eve isn’t just a fan of Matter; they’re actively shaping the standard. Their team is deeply involved with the development of Matter and the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA), and we were delighted to connect with them at the recent CSA meeting in Chicago. Their commitment runs so deep that Eve licenses its technology to help other manufacturers embrace Matter. In fact, fellow Works with Home Assistant partner <a href=\"/blog/2025/03/27/motionblinds-joins-wwha/\">Motionblinds</a> uses Eve’s technology, proudly displaying “Powered by Eve” on their certified motors.</p>\n<div class=\"alert\">\n    <p>\"Eve and Home Assistant are the perfect match for a local-first, privacy-centric smart home. With Eve devices featuring Matter, Thread, and absolutely no cloud connection in combination with Home Assistant's extensive, local automation capabilities, now everybody can enjoy the smart home the way it was meant to be: with you in control.\" <em style=\"text-align: right; display: block;\">-Jerome Gackel, CEO Eve Systems</em>\n</div>\n<h2>Certified Devices</h2>\n<p>In case you didn’t know, Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box with Home Assistant. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a>, and the support of <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers funds this work.</p>\n<p>Eve has certified the following Matter-over-Thread enabled devices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-door-window\">Eve Door &amp; Window</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-energy-outlet\">Eve Energy Outlet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-energy-outdoor\">Eve Energy Outdoor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-energy\">Eve Energy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-light-switch\">Eve Light Switch (U.S. &amp; Canada)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-dimmer-switch\">Eve Dimmer Switch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-motion\">Eve Motion</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-blinds-collection\">Eve Custom Smart Blinds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.evehome.com/eve-motionblinds\">Eve MotionBlinds Upgrade Kit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-thermo\">Eve Thermo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-weather\">Eve Weather</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Eve-rything You Need</h2>\n<p>It is amazing to have Eve in the Works with Home Assistant program, as we’ve been fans of their focus on privacy and local control for years. The list of devices they certified today is really comprehensive, and I dare say you could build a pretty well-rounded smart home just with their devices. There are even a couple of firsts for the program, including their smart radiator valve, outdoor weather sensor, outdoor outlet, and water-resistant motion sensor. Eve is continuously working on transitioning their complete smart home portfolio over to Matter, so if you spot a device that is not Matter-compatible yet - stay tuned.</p>\n<h3>FAQ on Works with Home Assistant</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>If I have a device that is not listed under ‘Works with Home Assistant’ does this mean it’s not supported?</strong></em> No! It just means that it hasn’t yet gone through testing with our team, either because the brand has not submitted it for testing, or because the device does not fit the program’s requirements (ex. it’s not an end-device or requires cloud connectivity). It may not be the same polished experience you would get from certified devices, but if you’ve been using the device for some time without issue, nothing will change. Our community is quite good at listing the devices they have confirmed to work on the integration page, so this is always worth double-checking if you’re unsure. We may test it down the road, but it’s up to the brand to choose what they submit for testing, so tell them what you want.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>Ok, so what’s the point of the Works with program?</strong></em> It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that the devices must have full functionality within Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud connectivity, and will continue to do so long-term. If you already own one of these devices, congrats! You’re safe in the knowledge that the manufacturers are committed long-term to providing Home Assistant support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>How were these devices tested?</strong></em> All devices in this list were tested using a standard Home Assistant Green, with the Connect ZBT-1 as the radio for the Thread Border Router, and our <a href=\"/integrations/matter/\">certified Matter Integration</a>.  If you have a different hardware configuration that works for you, then great. The above hardware is just what our team uses to ensure consistency across testing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em><strong>Will you be adding more Eve devices to the program?</strong></em> We are always interested in adding more devices. We’re excited to be working closely with the Eve team and look forward to continuing to bring cool new devices to the program. If there are products you’d like to see certified, feel free to let us know!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

They’re all free and will be full of smart people with smart homes. If you don’t see your city on this list, we’re encouraging the community to host their own meetups, so keep reading to learn more.</p>\n<h2>Our biggest party yet</h2>\n<p>I’m sure you’re all wondering, “<em>Missy, what is a Community Day?</em>”. In its simplest form, it’s a single day in which community members around the world set up local meetups with each other. That leaves a lot open, though. <em>Where do you sign up? How do you host your own meetup? How many people should show up? Where’s the best place to hold a meetup?</em> …that’s a lot of questions! 😳 Luckily, I have all the answers 😉.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Locations and registering to attend</h3>\n<p>To coordinate all these meetups, we are using Luma, a site focused on tech meetups. All the current events can be found below or on our <a href=\"https://lu.ma/haday2025\">Home Assistant Community Day</a> calendar.</p>\n<iframe\n  data-src=\"https://lu.ma/embed/calendar/cal-QXZXEJrvB3UaI63/events?lt=light\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"600\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  style=\"border: 1px solid #bfcbda88; border-radius: 4px;\"\n  allowfullscreen=\"\"\n  aria-hidden=\"false\"\n  tabindex=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n<p>All Community Day events are free, so <strong><a href=\"https://lu.ma/haday2025\">register before spaces run out!</a></strong> (No worries, there are waitlists!). We also have people who work full-time on Home Assistant attending these events. To find out who you can meet, head over to Luma 😎!</p>\n<h3>Host your own</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Is your city, country, or continent not on the list</strong></em> ⁉️ Time to take matters into your own hands, and create your own meetup.</p>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-community-day/event.png' alt=\"Example event\"/>Example event page for our London meetup 💂‍♂️🇬🇧</p>\n<p>Using Luma, <a href=\"https://lu.ma/signin\">create an account</a>, and navigate to our <a href=\"https://lu.ma/haday2025\">Home Assistant Community Day</a> event page, select <strong>Submit Event &gt; Create New Event</strong> (the button is above the calendar on the right). Don’t stress if you don’t have a venue yet—you can add it later! So people know you’re part of the worldwide party, we’ve created an <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1xnAIVvsekX1tmfE60f0qrHOoIFK9Cw_R\">invite graphic</a> you can set as the event image. Make sure you follow this checklist when you create your event:</p>\n<p>✅ <strong>Event Name</strong> = “(city name) meetup”<br />\n✅ <strong>Time zone</strong> = your local time<br />\n✅ <strong>Date</strong> = Saturday, May 24<br />\n✅ <strong>Time</strong> = your choosing! (4 hours max)<br />\n✅ <strong>Add Event Location</strong> = your city (or venue once you have one)<br />\n✅ <strong>Capacity</strong> = 50 max (less if the venue is smaller), and toggle the Waitlist on<br />\n✅ <strong>Hosts</strong> = Add me (Missy Quarry - <a href=\"mailto:missy.quarry@openhomefoundation.org\">missy.quarry@openhomefoundation.org</a>) as a host of the event so I can make sure it appears in the main event calendar</p>\n<p>Click <strong>Create Event</strong> once you’ve followed that checklist, then come let everyone know in the Home Assistant Community Day <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/1364989531069091920\">meetup thread on Discord</a> or the <a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/c/social/\">Social section of the Community forum</a>! 🎉</p>\n<p><em><strong>Capacity:</strong></em> If you’re wondering why we capped the capacity at 50, this is mostly to ensure that hosts don’t feel overwhelmed with finding a venue big enough. Also, that’s the average number of attendees who have registered for the last couple of events. You may have more people who want to attend your event - that’s where the waitlist comes in handy. 👏🏻</p>\n<p><em><strong>Location:</strong></em> This will depend on the host, but we highly encourage hosts to check out local venues like cafes, community spaces, or bars. Please make sure the venue agrees to you hosting the event there and that it’s an accommodating and welcoming place for everyone in our community. Consider accessibility and the facilities required for large groups (access to transport, food, drink, and washrooms)—this is also why we ask that people not host at their homes. Feel free to consider other public spaces, for instance, I pulled some strings at Microsoft for a cool space on campus to host the <a href=\"https://lu.ma/qb0hhhkm\">Redmond meetup</a>. Just remember, the venue fees are up to the host to pay.</p>\n<p><em><strong>What to provide/organize:</strong></em> These are free events, and hosts are not obligated to provide anything but good conversation. Keep it simple—this is just a chance for people to meet and chat.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Keep attendees informed:</strong></em>  You can always talk it out with your registered attendees via Luma—hosts will have the ability to “<em>Send a Blast</em>” out to their attendees. Also, the Community Day thread on Discord will be a great way to hook up with attendees on that platform. We’ll promote these events on the Home Assistant socials, to ensure we reach the whole community.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Clashes:</strong></em>  If two or more events are requested in the same city, we’ll link up hosts so they can organize things together.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Have more questions for me?</strong></em> Send me a message on Discord (<a href=\"https://discord.com/users/303933403303247872\">@adorablecyborg</a>) or <a href=\"mailto:missy@openhomefoundation.org?subject=Community%20Day%202025\">email</a>— I’m absolutely happy to help you out where I can! 😌</p>\n<h2>See you soon</h2>\n<p>Our team has been meeting the community all over the world, and y’all never cease to amaze me. People are doing really cool stuff with Home Assistant, and you’ll leave meetups with new automation ideas, cool DIY plans, and maybe even some new friends. Honestly, if you’re like me, every one of my family members are sick of hearing about my smart home, it’s time to meet some people who only want to talk about that! 🤝</p>\n<p>If you can’t make it on  May 24th, don’t fret—there’ll be a Community Day next year! Although Community Day will be special, you can always get on the Home Assistant community <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/1325926382575816725\">meetup channel</a> in Discord or the <a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/c/social/\">Social section of the forum</a> to set up group meetups throughout the year. 😊</p>\n<p>I can’t wait to see all the events added and how many people register for these meetups! 🤩 I’ll share more information as the day approaches, including how you can share your meetup photo 📸, which we’ll feature on our channels. See you on the socials!</p>\n",

Reolink has certified a wide range of their devices including battery-powered and wired options, as well as devices with Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) and Wi-Fi connectivity.</p>\n<p>When someone in the Home Assistant community asks for camera recommendations, Reolink often tops the list. This strong reputation is well-earned, as they prioritize local control, don’t require cloud connectivity for their advanced features, and support open protocols whenever possible.<!--more--></p>\n<h2>Seeing eye-to-eye</h2>\n<p>Founded in 2009, Reolink has been building video security solutions for nearly any setup—whether you need a monster 10-camera PoE system or just a few Wi-Fi-connected cameras. They’ve done this while closely aligning with the Open Home values of privacy, choice, and sustainability.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, they’ve put in great options for maintaining privacy, specifically prioritizing storing video locally, with cloud storage as an optional extra. Files aren’t locked down—wired cameras support multiple streaming protocols, while battery models can send clips to an FTP server—giving users better choice and control.</p>\n<p>While other brands lock features like motion detection behind subscriptions, Reolink devices work fully locally—even without internet access, all advertised features will work now and into the future. With support for streaming protocols and fully local use, these cameras are set to work for years, which is a win for the planet 💚.</p>\n<p>It’s amazing that there is a security camera brand that respects the Open Home values while supporting all the latest features—like resolutions greater than 4K, long battery life, PoE, solar power, color night vision, advanced motion and object detection.</p>\n<h2>Picture perfect integration</h2>\n<p>Another reason these cameras get recommended so often is the platinum-quality <a href=\"/integrations/reolink/\">Reolink integration</a>. This ensures user-friendly features like automatic device discovery, smooth setup, firmware updates, and detailed documentation. Critically, <a href=\"/docs/quality_scale/#-platinum\">platinum integrations</a> include exceptionally efficient and well-written code, improving overall system stability and reliability.</p>\n<p>All Works with Home Assistant-certified devices feature top-quality integrations, but what makes this one special is that it was built by the Home Assistant community. Huge thanks to the Reolink team and <a href=\"https://github.com/starKillerOG\">@StarkillerOG</a> for the effort that brought it to the Platinum level late last year.</p>\n<p>Reolink is a big fan of our active and engaged community and joined Works with Home Assistant to continue this close connection to them.</p>\n<div class=\"alert\">\n    <p>\"Reolink is thrilled to join Home Assistant's ecosystem to empower users with smarter, more integrated security solutions.

I donated Home Assistant to the Foundation, and others in the community followed suit by contributing vital projects that form the core of the Open Home ecosystem. That’s also where we set out our mission: to fight for privacy (your data is yours), choice (no vendor lock-in), and sustainability (devices built to last).</p>\n<p>The Foundation wasn’t just paperwork—it took us from being “just” a bunch of (very big) open-source GitHub projects to being seen as serious industry players. We’re now recognized as a peer, invited to speak at events like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMif_tYODNU\">Connections summit at CES</a>, joining the <a href=\"/blog/2024/09/24/we-are-joining-the-z-wave-alliance-board/\">Z-Wave Alliance board</a>, and even being named by <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91269253/consumer-electronics-most-innovative-companies-2025\">Fast Company as a top innovator</a>—all because we respect user data!

These are some of the biggest open source projects in the world, including Home Assistant, ESPHome, Z-Wave JS, Zigpy, Open Home Matter Server, our voice technology, apps, and more. Many of the founders of these Open Home projects now work for the Open Home Foundation, turning their part-time passions into full-time careers - our in-house expertise is truly industry-leading. Supporting all this work requires a steady stream of income.</p>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/ohf-structure.jpg' alt=\"how we fund our projects\"/></p>\n<p>Nabu Casa existed before the Open Home Foundation, and during State of the Open Home 2025, <a href=\"https://github.com/bbangert\">Ben Bangert</a>, Nabu Casa’s co-founder and CTO, explained why and how it was set up,</p>\n<div class=\"alert\">Our approach at Nabu Casa has always been about sustainable growth. By avoiding the startup model, we can ensure we are under no pressure to compromise on our mission and values. It has driven our ability to hire and expand the company without taking on outside interests that would have goals that don't align with ours.</div>\n<p>Nabu Casa builds and maintains the products that make Home Assistant easier to use, like <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/\">hardware</a>. A big chunk of its profit continues to go to projects like Home Assistant, but now it does so via the Open Home Foundation. The Open Home Foundation builds on Nabu Casa’s original intent of removing outside pressures from the projects it funds, allowing them never to be bought or ruined by commercial meddling.</p>\n<h2>Foundation upgrades</h2>\n<p>In the year since launching the Foundation, more steps have been taken to protect the Open Home. We chose Switzerland to base the Foundation as it provided the best protection for these projects. We recently transitioned from a Swiss Verein to <a href=\"https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/we-are-number-one/#:~:text=Important%20changes%20to%20the%20Open%20Home%20Foundation\">a more protective Stiftung</a>. We also achieved tax-exempt status, meaning your support can go even further. Where previously, all 56 employees worked for Nabu Casa, now all employees who work directly on Foundation projects work for the Foundation, further enhancing the independence of Foundation projects.</p>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/ohf-growth.jpg' alt=\"Employees move from Nabu Casa to the Foundation\"/>The Open Home Foundation is growing</p>\n<p>A big shout-out to <a href=\"https://github.com/pvizeli\">Pascal</a>! He was instrumental in starting the Foundation and has spent the last year fine-tuning its operation.</p>\n<h2>Donations and Partnerships</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: -1.2em;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=nnxO8H4GTtYRuMEL&t=1598\">(00:26:38)</a></p>\n<p>This year, we received several high-profile donations, and at the State of the Open Home, we announced another considerable donation: <a href=\"https://www.espressif.com/\">Espressif</a> has donated $25,000 to the Foundation! Espressif designs many of the chips that power ESPHome. They are supporting Open Home software development to help drive the DIY sensor and controller revolution forward.</p>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/ohf-supporters.jpg' alt=\"Commercial Partner: Nabu Casa. Donors: DuckDuckGo, Espressif. Supporters: Cloudflare, Ghost, GitHub, Lokalise, Netlify, Sentry.\"/>More than donations, we have projects that provide amazing in-kind support</p>\n<p>Late last year, we received <a href=\"https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/the-era-of-open-voice/#:~:text=DuckDuckGo%20donates%20to%20the%20Open%20Home%20Foundation\">$25,000 from DuckDuckGo</a> for being part of a better Internet ecosystem. These two sizeable donations make a meaningful impact on our work, and we are incredibly grateful for the support of these two organizations that believe in our mission. We also always try to support the projects that we believe are vital to our work and the broader Open Home ecosystem. That is why this year we started recurring donations to <a href=\"https://buildroot.org/sponsors.html\">Buildroot</a>, <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/alpinelinux\">Alpine</a>, and <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/aio-libs\">aiohttp</a>.</p>\n<p>As we said previously, we want sustainable funding, and small intermittent donations don’t allow us to effectively financially plan. <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/\">Home Assistant Cloud subscriptions</a> remain the best way for individuals to support us financially.</p>\n<h2>New Open Home Foundation projects</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: -1.2em;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=6LVwbMVNkipqRcma&t=1903\">(00:31:34)</a></p>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/hacs-ma.jpg' alt=\"Music Assistant and HACS become OHF projects\"/></p>\n<p>The Open Home Foundation owns and governs over 240 open standards, drivers, and libraries that support the realization of the Open Home, and it’s time to add a couple more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/marcelveldt\">Marcel van der Veldt</a> joined the live stream to announce that he has donated <a href=\"https://www.music-assistant.io/\">Music Assistant</a> to the Open Home Foundation! Music Assistant has always been deeply entwined with multiple Open Home projects, and we’re excited to see how this extra support will allow more people to take back control of their music, on their players. If you want some interesting insight into Music Assistant, my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=6LVwbMVNkipqRcma&amp;t=1903\">interview with Marcel</a> during the event is a must-watch.</p>\n<p>And there was more! The <a href=\"https://www.hacs.xyz/\">Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)</a>, created by <a href=\"https://github.com/ludeeus\">Joakim Sørensen</a>, has also been donated to the Open Home Foundation! HACS is an amazing tool for the community, giving more choice to Home Assistant users and serving as a great starting point for your development journey. These projects are such a fantastic fit for the Foundation—I wouldn’t be surprised if you already thought they were part of it.</p>\n<h2>Community</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: -1.2em;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=Kxw6dH5h6p8QLdKb&t=2940\">(00:49:00)</a></p>\n<p>When asked at a recent event “What is my North Star?”, my answer came quickly, it is the “Community”. Nothing we do would be possible without our contributions, and supporters. Meeting community members during my travels is one of the best parts of this job.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/frenck\">Franck Nijhof</a>, Home Assistant Lead at the Open Home Foundation, took the stage to celebrate the incredible community. He shared some of the biggest community highlights of the year, including becoming the most active open source project on GitHub (21,000+ unique contributors in 2024!) and winning the most welcoming open-source project award. He emphasized that this success belongs to the entire community, which extends far beyond developers, as there are so many ways to contribute including being a translator, designer, tester, forum helper, or content creator.</p>\n<p>Our community is doing amazing things with Home Assistant,</p>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/runar.jpg' alt=\"Rúnar Björn Herrera using Home Assistant in his home\"/>Check out how Rúnar Björn Herrera is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=D57cJ7Moy2nd5g-z&t=3788\">making his home more accessible</a> and sharing his expertise with the community. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=D57cJ7Moy2nd5g-z&t=3788\">(01:03:08)</a></p>\n<p>One big announcement Franck made was that this year we went from 1 million to over 2 million active installations in 2024! The key to harnessing this community power, Franck explained, is actively listening and building with users, not just for them, but with them. Initiatives like the <a href=\"/blog/2024/11/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck/\">“Month of What The Heck?!”</a> and adapting plans based on feedback (like with backups) demonstrate this commitment to iterating together, even when initial ideas need adjustment.</p>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/HA-community-day.jpg' alt=\"Home Assistant Community Day will be on May 24th 2025\"/></p>\n<p>Looking ahead, the goal is to deepen this collaboration by developing “fully in the open” across all disciplines, fostering a collective intelligence. To further strengthen these connections, Franck announced the first official <strong>Home Assistant Community Day on May 24th, 2025</strong> 🎉, encouraging users worldwide to organize and attend local meetups.</p>\n<h2>Research</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: -1.2em;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=W-QRbgOtwuIwddlX&t=4083\">(01:08:03)</a></p>\n<p>We want the Foundation projects to serve our community, and that’s why we’ve put a bigger focus on research. <a href=\"https://github.com/anakinsbrna\">Annika Schulz</a> is our UX Researcher, and at this year’s State of the Open Home, she gave us a fantastic overview of the privacy-respecting research we’re conducting and the invaluable insights it is bringing.</p>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/ohf-survey.jpg' alt=\"Home Assistant Community Day will be on May 24th 2025\"/>You love choice! but we're still learning what privacy and sustainability mean to you.</p>\n<p>Our 2024 Community Survey was a huge success, with over 8,600 responses! We learned so much about who uses Home Assistant. For instance, a big majority of the people who answered the survey are tech-curious, have been using HA for 3+ years, live in households of 2.8 people on average, and have somewhere between 11-100 devices 😎 (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=W-QRbgOtwuIwddlX&amp;t=4083\">watch the whole segment</a>, there are so many interesting results!). We also delved into their motivations and how deeply our values of Choice and Privacy resonate, even if the practical implementation of privacy remains a challenge for many. Annika’s key message – “User research helps remind us… We are not the users.” – we need to challenge our assumptions and personal biases.</p>\n<h2>Works with Home Assistant</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: -1.2em;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=EeNgbeu5_8eiYsfR&t=5053\">(01:24:13)</a></p>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/wwha.jpg' alt=\"Miranda and Paulus talking about Works with Home Assistant\"/></p>\n<p>With choice playing such a big part in why our community uses Open Home projects, it’s crucial to ensure users can find great devices that align with our values. <a href=\"https://github.com/miranda-gb\">Miranda Bishop</a>, our Partnership Manager, joined me to discuss the “Works with Home Assistant” program. Explaining it isn’t about exclusion but about <em>highlighting</em> manufacturers committed to local control. They also sign an agreement to provide long-term support and be a positive force in the community.</p>\n<p>We had a couple of our existing partners send us messages about joining the program, and thanks for the warm words. Also teased during the live stream were new partners close to formally joining the program, including <a href=\"https://reolink.com/\">Reolink</a>, <a href=\"https://www.evehome.com/en\">Eve</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.shelly.com/\">Shelly</a> (but more details on those soon). Miranda stressed that the program isn’t “pay us money and you can have the badge”; it’s about shared ethics of privacy, choice, and sustainability. The goal remains: within 3 years, to offer certified choices for every device type, everywhere, at all budgets. Your feedback helps drive this – keep telling manufacturers you want local control and point them to the <a href=\"https://works-with.home-assistant.io/\">Works with Home Assistant program</a>, as we’re here to help.</p>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/mob-museum.jpg' alt=\"Video showing the Mob Museum in Las Vegas using Shelly and Home Assistant\"/>Shelly with Home Assistant helps <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=vv6v0F-Pzv-46iMQ&t=6897\">automate Las Vegas' Mob Museum</a>, including its moonshine production! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=vv6v0F-Pzv-46iMQ&t=6897\">(01:54:00)</a></p>\n<h2>Voice &amp; AI</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: -1.2em;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=EskXSERmtLVlyAUg&t=5765\">(01:36:05)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/synesthesiam/\">Mike Hansen</a>, our “Voice Guy,” was the next to take the stage. In case you missed it, this year we launched our first voice hardware device, Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition, which pairs incredibly with all the voice software we’ve been developing. To put it mildly, it’s been a pretty big hit! Mike explained how we built it to help push forward open source voice development, and it’s very much succeeding. Before Voice Preview Edition there wasn’t an Icelandic-speaking voice assistant, this is now being developed—all without a single person at the Foundation speaking this language.</p>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/voice-ai.jpg' alt=\"JLo's voice AI setup\"/>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jlpouffier\">@Jlo's</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=VLjKXJoGuSXZmsRd&t=6157\">AI-powered home in action (01:42:37)</a></p>\n<p>Mike touched on future plans for more conversational interactions and enhanced integration with Music Assistant. He also addressed AI, explaining how we see Home Assistant as the perfect private playground for users to experiment with AI technologies locally, focusing on utility, not monetization, unlike the big players. A landline phone on set even rang during the segment with an AI-powered notification from <em>my own</em> Home Assistant—apologies, it predates silent mode ☎️.</p>\n<h2>Living Our Values</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-top: -1.2em;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=dWjKOI0s8ZE5JV5T&t=7025\">(01:57:05)</a></p>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/values.jpg' alt=\"Paulus, Annika, Franck, and Madelena speaking about values\"/></p>\n<p>We wrapped up with a discussion focused on our values with Annika Schulz, Franck Nijhof, and Madelena Mak. We touched on user privacy concerns Annika uncovered, the diverse ways Franck sees ‘choice’ manifesting (beyond just protocols, including local APIs), and how sustainability, as Madelena explained, connects to durability, energy management, and the right to repair.</p>\n<p>Finally, together with <a href=\"https://github.com/madelena\">Madelena Mak</a>, we looked back at our 2024 <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-introduction/\">roadmap</a> – I’m proud we delivered on nearly everything we set out to do, including top community requests. This builds trust. We gave a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=zc_AKoWOKtx4zIB1&amp;t=7855\">glimpse into our 2025 Roadmap</a> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=H1jmjDisJ4tckLak&amp;t=8211\">02:16:51</a>), including a new focus on harnessing our collective intelligence. This will be driven by a new information architecture that gives context to devices via a device database (expect a detailed post on Roadmap 2025 soon!).</p>\n<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/closing.jpg' alt=\"Paulus, Franck, and Madelena celebrate the shows finale\"/></p>\n<p>The live Q&amp;A session at the end was, as always, a highlight, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=WeI5OUe9lLdcZcii&amp;t=9258\">tackling great questions from the audience</a>.</p>\n<p>It was an energizing day, reaffirming my belief in our mission and the incredible power of this community. We’re building something unique and important together. Thank you to everyone who watched, participated, and continuously supports the Open Home. Your belief in this project makes it all possible.</p>\n<p>And, of course, a huge thank you to all our <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud subscribers</a>.

We introduced the powerful drag-and-drop sections view and plenty\nof new tile card features.</p>\n<p>We’re going a step further by delivering a dashboard that’s immediately\nrelevant, saving you time and effort while still leaving room for personal\ntouches.</p>\n<h3>A new experimental Areas dashboard</h3>\n<p>Until now, our default dashboard has served as a simple starting point—a list\nof <span class='terminology'>entities<span class='terminology-tooltip'>An entity represents a sensor, actor, or function in Home Assistant. Entities are used to monitor physical properties or to control other entities. An entity is usually part of a device or a service.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/entities_domains/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> grouped by <span class='terminology'>area<span class='terminology-tooltip'>An area in Home Assistant is a <a href=\"/docs/organizing/\">logical grouping</a> of devices and entities that are meant to match areas (or rooms) in the physical world: your home. For example, the <code>living room</code> area groups devices and entities in your living room.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/organizing/areas/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> or <span class='terminology'>device<span class='terminology-tooltip'>A device is a model representing a physical or logical unit that contains entities.</span></span>\n<span class='terminology'>domains<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Each integration in Home Assistant has a unique identifier: The domain. It is often shown as the first part (before the dot) of entity IDs.</span></span>. While helpful for beginners, it quickly becomes limited as\na smart home grows. We’ve learned that while some users enjoy building their\nown dashboards, many simply want something that works for their household.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot viewing an area of the new experimental Areas dashboard\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-04/areas-dashboard-detail.png\" />\n<p>The new experimental <a href=\"/dashboards/dashboards/#areas-dashboard\">Areas dashboard</a> automatically generates a ready-to-use\ndashboard based on the areas you’ve set up in your home. It uses <a href=\"/dashboards/sections/\">sections</a> and\n<a href=\"/dashboards/tile/\">tile cards</a> for a modern, clean, and intuitive look—instantly. No more starting\nfrom a blank slate!</p>\n<p>Each <a href=\"/docs/organizing/areas/\">area</a> now has its own dedicated page, giving you a clear and organized view\nof the devices in that space. Entities, such as lights, covers, cameras,\nand more, are automatically grouped by domain so you can easily locate the ones\nyou need.</p>\n<p>Want to tweak it? <em>Yes, you can</em>! You can rearrange, show, or hide entities to\nsuit your preferences. At the top of each area page, temperature and humidity\nbadges quickly indicate room comfort levels, which are configurable in the\narea’s settings.</p>\n<p>On top of all that, the Overview page brings it all together, showing all your\nareas in one place. Each section corresponds to a room in your home, and just\nlike with the area pages, you can rearrange, show, or hide areas here as well,\nbased on your preferences.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the overview page of the new Areas dashboard\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-04/areas-dashboard-overview.png\" />\n<p>If you haven’t <a href=\"/docs/organizing/areas/\">organized your devices into areas</a> yet, now’s the perfect time to\nstart—it’s key to unlocking this new dashboard experience. To get\nstarted with the <a href=\"/dashboards/dashboards/#areas-dashboard\">Areas dashboard</a>, go to\n<strong><a href='https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/lovelace_dashboards' class='my' target='_blank'>Settings &gt; Dashboards</a></strong>, and select\n<strong>Add Dashboard</strong> in the bottom right, next select the <strong>Areas (experimental)</strong>\noption from the dialog:</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of the dialog when adding a new dashboard, showing the new option to add the new experimental Area dashboard\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-04/areas-experimental-dialog.png\" />\n<p>The new experimental <a href=\"/dashboards/dashboards/#areas-dashboard\">Areas dashboard</a> previews what’s to come. We’ve learned from\nour users that they organize their homes in different ways—by rooms,\nby function, by device, and more. They often combine all of the above,\nand therefore, our upcoming default dashboard will accommodate\nall these methods of <a href=\"/docs/organizing/\">organization</a>.</p>\n<p>Over time, this foundation will grow into a flexible system that adapts to\nyour priorities, whether that’s keeping an eye on security, managing energy use,\ngoing through your family calendar and chores, learning about the weather,\nor simply watching your pets.</p>\n<p>Please note that this is experimental, meaning it is subject to change and may\nnot always work as intended. We would love your feedback if you notice some\naspects we can improve. The community’s dashboards, shared over the years,\nhave helped shape this design, and we would love to see how it works\nwith a wide variety of your homes. Even if you already have the perfect\ndashboard built for your home, try it!</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> We had a feedback form in the release notes in this spot, but that’s closed now. Thanks for your input!</p>\n<h3>Time for a new card!</h3>\n<p>It has been a while since we introduced a new card, but this release, we\nthought it might be <em><strong>time</strong></em> to add a new one! Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mrdarrengriffin\">@mrdarrengriffin</a>,\nHome Assistant now features a <a href=\"/dashboards/clock/\">Clock card</a>!</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a dashboard with a large clock card on it, indicating the current time\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-04/card-clock.png\" />\n<p>Yeah, the card is “just” showing the current time, but it is a really nice\naddition to our card collection. It might be a great card for dashboards\nyou are showing on things like a wall-mounted tablet!</p>\n<p>The Clock card offers several customization options, including the ability to\nadjust the clock size, timezone, display the seconds alongside the hours\nand minutes, and the ability to choose between a 12-hour or 24-hour format.</p>\n<p>For more details, check out the <a href=\"/dashboards/clock/\">Clock card documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Voice</h2>\n<p>The <em><strong><a href=\"/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/\">“year of the voice”</a></strong></em> might be behind\nus, but we keep improving the voice experience in Home Assistant! This release\nbrings several enhancements to make interacting with your smart home even better.</p>\n<h3>Improved Voice Wizard</h3>\n<p>If you set up a Home Assistant voice assistant compatible device,\nlike the <a href=\"/voice-pe/\">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a>,\nyou will be guided through setting up your voice assistant, and this experience\nhas been greatly improved in this release.</p>\n<p>As our voice experience is offering more choices, including local options\nlike Speech-to-Phrase, we wanted to make sure you are able to make the right\nchoices for your use case.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Two screenshots showing the new voice wizard that guides you setting up the best possible voice experience\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-04/voice-wizard.png\" />\n<p>The wizard will now help you make a more informed decision based on your\nlanguage, desired functionality, and device capabilities, ensuring you get the\nbest experience with your voice assistant.</p>\n<h3>Continued conversation with LLMs</h3>\n<p>Ever tried to have a conversation with your voice assistant that is hooked up to\nan LLM like ChatGPT? It’s good fun. However, having to say <em>“Ok Nabu”</em>, whenever\nyou answer one of Assist’s questions can really slow things down.</p>\n<p>This release introduces the ability to have a continued conversation with LLMs.\nIf the LLM returns with a question, we will detect that and keep the\nconversation going, without the need for you to say <em>“Ok Nabu”</em> again.</p>\n<p><lite-youtube videoid=\"KyAuzYe4vAw\" videotitle=\"Continued conversation demo\"></lite-youtube></p>\n<p>This is a great way to have a more natural conversation with your voice\nassistants, and it works with all LLMs supported by Home Assistant.</p>\n<h3>Starting conversations</h3>\n<p>During <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6VvzDSI8RU&amp;t=4750s\">Voice chapter 9</a>,\nwe added the ability for Home Assistant <a href=\"/blog/2025/02/13/voice-chapter-9-speech-to-phrase/#home-assistant-phones-home-analog-phones-are-back\">to call analog phones to start a\nconversation</a>. As of this release, this\nfeature is now available for ESPHome-based voice assistants,\nlike the <a href=\"/voice-pe/\">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a>!</p>\n<p>This is a fantastic feature, as it allows you to build your own automations that\ncan send out voice prompts from your voice assistant and listen for a response,\ninstead of you having to trigger the conversation by saying the wake word.</p>\n<p>Imagine, for example, you have left the garage door open, and a few minutes\nlater, your assistant says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hey, I noticed you left the garage door open, do you want me to close it for you?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You simply reply “yes” or “no,” and it handles the rest… 🤯 Or perhaps after a\nlong day at work, you return home, and your assistant greets you warmly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Welcome home, Frenck! Hope you had a great day. Want to hear the news or maybe enjoy some music?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JLo made a great demo video of this one, involving his oven and the assistant\nasking if he wants to set a timer:</p>\n<p><lite-youtube videoid=\"dq7--T_pVNA\" videotitle=\"Starting a conversation from the Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition\"></lite-youtube></p>\n<p>This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for voice-driven automations.\nCurrently, this capability is only available when using LLM integrations,\nbut we’re exploring more use cases where it would be helpful.</p>\n<p>If you listen closely to the demo above, you’ll notice a brief pre-announce\nsound just before the conversation starts. This little notification prevents\nyour assistant from startling anyone by suddenly speaking out of nowhere and\npreventing a jump scare! 🫣</p>\n<p>You could even use custom sounds based on the scenario—like a doorbell chime\nfor visitors or a train station-style jingle when your morning commute gets\ndelayed, giving you extra time to grab that coffee before heading out. ☕</p>\n<h2>Onboarding with a Home Assistant Cloud backup</h2>\n<p>If you are a user of <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/\">Home Assistant Cloud by Nabu Casa</a>, it means\nyou can safely store a backup of your Home Assistant installation in the cloud\nas part of your subscription. A really convenient service that ensures you always\nhave a secure and worry-free backup of your Home Assistant installation, no\nmatter what happens.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s say something did happen, maybe a hardware failure, or maybe you\nare migrating to a new <a href=\"/green/\">Home Assistant Green</a>, as of this release, you can\ndirectly restore your backup from the Home Assistant Cloud during the\nonboarding process of your new Home Assistant installation.</p>\n<p>This means you can get up and running with your new Home Assistant installation\nin no time, with all your settings, automations, and integrations restored from\nyour backup.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the restore from Nabu Casa's Home Assistant Cloud during set up\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-04/restore-from-cloud.png\" />\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

This scale helps us and our contributors to ensure\nintegrations are of high quality, maintainable, and provide the best possible\nuser experience.</p>\n<p>This release, we celebrate several <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> that have improved\ntheir quality scale:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>4 integrations reached platinum</strong> 🏆</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/integrations/azure_storage\">Azure Storage</a>, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/zweckj\">@zweckj</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/integrations/fronius\">Fronius</a>, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/farmio\">@farmio</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/integrations/iron_os\">IronOS</a>, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/tr4nt0r\">@tr4nt0r</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/integrations/incomfort\">inComfort</a>, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/jbouwh\">@jbouwh</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>2 integrations reached silver</strong> 🥈</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/integrations/roborock\">Roborock</a>, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/Lash-L\">@Lash-L</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/integrations/vodafone_station\">Vodafone Station</a>, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/chemelli74\">@chemelli74</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a huge achievement for these integrations and their maintainers.

Thanks for this one <a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a>!</li>\n<li>We now support turning on/off TVs in <a href=\"/integrations/homekit\">HomeKit</a>, nice one <a href=\"https://github.com/bdraco\">@bdraco</a>!</li>\n<li>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/piitaya\">@piitaya</a>, we now support lawn mower devices in <a href=\"/integrations/google_assistant\">Google Assistant</a>\nand <a href=\"/integrations/homekit\">HomeKit</a>!</li>\n<li>Variables in automations &amp; scripts have been greatly simplified and fixed by\n<a href=\"https://github.com/arturpragacz\">@arturpragacz</a>. All variables are now accessible anywhere in the script or\nautomation, greatly simplifying the use of variables. Amazing!</li>\n<li>We now support adding additional interactions to cards! The hold and\ndouble tap actions are now available through the UI. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/piitaya\">@piitaya</a>!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Templates</h2>\n<p>If you are a power user, you probably use <span class='terminology'>templates<span class='terminology-tooltip'>A template is an automation definition that can include variables for the action or data from the trigger values. This allows automations to generate dynamic actions.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/automation/templating/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> in your\nautomations, scripts, or maybe even your dashboard. This release has a few\nadditions to our template engine that you might find useful.</p>\n<p>To start with, in the <a href=\"/integrations/template\">template integration</a> the light and switch templates have\nbeen migrated to support the new and modern YAML style. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Petro31\">@Petro31</a> for\nthis one!</p>\n<p>More noteworthy is the addition of a series of new template functions to make\nworking with data a lot easier:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/docs/configuration/templating/#combining-dictionaries\"><code>combine</code></a> – Combine multiple dictionaries.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/docs/configuration/templating/#find-elements-in-first-list-not-in-second-list\"><code>difference</code></a> – Find elements present in one list but not another.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/docs/configuration/templating/#flatten-a-list-of-lists\"><code>flatten</code></a> – Flatten a list of lists into a single list.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/docs/configuration/templating/#floors\"><code>floor_entities</code></a> – Retrieve entities associated with a specific floor.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/docs/configuration/templating/#find-common-elements-between-lists\"><code>intersect</code></a> – Identify common elements between lists.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/docs/configuration/templating/#hashing\"><code>md5</code>, <code>sha1</code>, <code>sha256</code>, <code>sha512</code></a> – Perform common hashing operations.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/docs/configuration/templating/#shuffling\"><code>shuffle</code></a> – Randomly shuffle items in a list.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/docs/configuration/templating/#find-elements-that-are-in-either-list-but-not-in-both\"><code>symmetric_difference</code></a> – Find items in either list but not in both.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/docs/configuration/templating/#determining-types\"><code>typeof</code></a> – Determine the type of a variable or object for debugging.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/docs/configuration/templating/#combine-all-unique-elements-from-two-lists\"><code>union</code></a> – Merge unique elements from two lists.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Device hierarchy for energy management</h2>\n<p>This release, <a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a> has introduced an improvement to Home Assistant’s\nenergy management system—one that’s been highly requested by the community.</p>\n<p>This means you can now create a <strong>device hierarchy</strong> within your energy\nconfiguration, establishing parent-child relationships between devices.</p>\n<p>For example, imagine having a breaker monitoring the total energy consumption\nof a circuit, but also separately tracking individual devices connected to that\ncircuit. Previously, Home Assistant might double-count this usage. Now, it\nunderstands these relationships and accurately shows the individual device\nusage without duplication.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Sreenshot of the individual device usage graph taken from the energy dashboard\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-04/energy-management-device-hierarchy.png\" />\n<p>In this screenshot, the water heater is a child of the heat pump. Both report\nenergy usage separately, but the water heater’s consumption is also included in\nthe total reported by the heat pump. With device hierarchy enabled,\nHome Assistant correctly shows the usage of each device.</p>\n<p>Awesome addition there <a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a>!</p>\n<h2>Patch releases</h2>\n<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.4 in April.\nThese patch releases only contain bug fixes.

They not only provide all-in-one smart blinds, but also upgrade kits for your existing roller blinds, which is great for cutting down on waste.</p>\n<h2>A window to the future</h2>\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-03-motionblinds/powered-by-eve.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Motionblinds powered by Eve\">\n<p>Motionblinds are definitely a leader in the smart blinds space and have partnered with <a href=\"https://www.evehome.com/en\">Eve</a> Systems, a leading provider of smart home devices, headquartered in Germany and part of ABB. This partnership brings Matter-over-Thread to their motors. Together, we have tested and certified these Matter-certified Eve Motionblinds. It’s easy to tell which are part of Works with Home Assistant, as they’ll include the “powered by Eve” badge.</p>\n<p>Motionblinds that use Bluetooth and 433MHz technology will also be getting the ‘Works With Home Assistant’ treatment, as we’re certifying motors that connect via the Motionblinds Matter Bridge (CM-55). This provides an excellent local way to connect this additional range of products to Home Assistant, allowing many more Motionblinds motors to give the best experience with Home Assistant. Check out our <a href=\"https://next.home-assistant.io/integrations/motionblinds_matter/\">Motionblinds integrations page</a> for a full list of the different motors that are certified. Be aware that standalone, Bluetooth-integrated blinds are not currently certified under the ‘Works With’ program.</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-motionblinds/matter-hub.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Motionblinds Matter Bridge\">Motionblinds Matter Bridge (CM-55)</p>\n<p>Home Assistant was recently <a href=\"/blog/2025/03/10/matter-certification/\">Matter certified</a>, and with these blinds certified to work with Home Assistant, end-to-end these devices are going to give a seamless experience. Every Works with Home Assistant product is tested by our team, works locally, and the brand promises to provide great long-term support.</p>\n<h3>Which devices have been certified?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://motionblinds.com/products/roller\">Roller Shades</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://motionblinds.com/products/double-roller\">Double Roller Shades</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://motionblinds.com/products/venetian\">Venetian Blinds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://motionblinds.com/products/honeycomb\">Honeycomb Shades</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://motionblinds.com/products/curtains\">Curtains</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://motionblinds.com/products/pleated\">Pleated Shades</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://motionblinds.com/products/vertical\">Vertical Blinds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://motionblinds.com/products/roman\">Roman Shades</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://motionblinds.com/products/upgrade-kit\">Upgrade Kit for Roller Blinds</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these devices connect directly to Home Assistant via Matter, provided you pick the “powered by Eve” option, or combine with the Matter bridge.

      "Content": "<p><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-matter-certification/art.jpg' alt=\"Home Assistant is officially matter certified\" class='no-shadow' /></p>\n<p>Matter in Home Assistant has been officially certified! 🎉 The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) has certified <a href=\"https://csa-iot.org/csa_product/home-assistant/\">Home Assistant</a> and the <a href=\"https://csa-iot.org/csa_product/open-home-foundation-matter-server/\">Open Home Foundation Matter Server</a>, the first open-source project to receive this certification. Certification is proof that open source projects can sit among, or even above, big tech when it comes to providing the best smart home experience.</p>\n<p>Home Assistant, as part of the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a>, strongly believes in open standards. They embody our values of choice, privacy, and sustainability in the smart home. When a standard is well supported, consumers get access to a wide range of smart home devices that should work far into the future, which is great for sustainability. Best of all, they work locally, keeping your smart home data in your home.</p>\n<p>All these benefits led us to include open standards certification <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#open-standards-certified-quality\">in our roadmap</a>. Home Assistant’s implementations of Matter, Zigbee, and Z-Wave are already industry-leading, so it only makes sense to clearly signal and give users peace of mind that we provide true compatibility. This most recent certification is not just big for Home Assistant, but read on to see how it also helps any open source project looking to use Matter.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Matter matters</h2>\n<p class=\"img\"><lite-youtube videoid=\"rEugjMk-4II\" videotitle=\"State of Matter 2024\"></lite-youtube>Our live stream from 2024 explains Matter in depth</p>\n<p>Matter is the latest smart home open standard, which is looking to connect and control smart home devices regardless of their manufacturer or which ecosystem you want to control them from. Like the other open standards we support, it can be controlled fully locally, meaning these devices are not reliant on the cloud to work. The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) is the body behind the Matter standard, representing its many members. They certify devices and set the rules on how they work together.</p>\n<p>If you’re not familiar with Matter, I’m not surprised. Though its adoption is growing, it’s only a <a href=\"https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-arrives/\">couple of years old</a>. The most important companies in the smart home space have joined this standard, but support is still growing and becoming more consistent. If it fulfills its promise, any smart home product should work with your ecosystem of choice, and that makes us optimistic about its future.</p>\n<p>More and more Matter devices are entering the market, and if you’re buying new smart devices, it will just be a matter of time 😉 before you own one. To this point, Matter devices are even a part of our <a href=\"https://partner.home-assistant.io/\">Works With Home Assistant</a> program. <a href=\"/blog/2024/09/03/aqara-joins-works-with-home-assistant/\">Aqara was the first</a> to join our program with Matter devices, and we tested these devices ourselves to ensure they give the best experience possible in Home Assistant. This year, we expect many more Matter devices to join the program, and we should have more updates soon.</p>\n<p>From a technical perspective, Matter is really interesting—it can work with different smart home systems at the same time. It also keeps the way devices connect and communicate separate, allowing it to connect to devices over Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and <a href=\"/integrations/thread/\">Thread</a> (a new mesh network technology for smart devices). Read our <a href=\"/blog/2024/01/25/matter-livestream-blog/\">State of Matter blog</a> or watch Paulus’ appearance on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0Y75XEXAXfY?si=nSDpP6THkWhkARuc&amp;t=3493\">the Vergecast Matter Holiday Spec-Tacular</a> for a deeper dive into the standard.</p>\n<h2>What certification brings</h2>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-matter-certification/ha-matter.png' alt=\"Home Assistant Matter certification\"/>Well, this is a bit... awesome</p>\n<p>First and foremost, from a usability perspective, nothing will change for you. We are consistently the first to adopt the newest Matter versions, currently providing the highest version available. We’ll keep on improving the Matter Server and the Matter integration at the same pace, ensuring that all device types in the Matter spec will work perfectly with Home Assistant—just from now on it will come with this certification badge.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://csa-iot.org/csa_product/open-home-foundation-matter-server/\">Open Home Foundation Matter Server</a> is now an officially trusted/certified software component, while <a href=\"https://csa-iot.org/csa_product/home-assistant/\">Home Assistant</a> is a certified “User Interface Component” (more on this distinction below). This allows us to clearly show this with a logo, along with being listed on the Matter website. For new Home Assistant users, this helps build confidence, knowing it is a supported way to use Matter. Similarly, for brands that don’t know much about Home Assistant, these references can be surprisingly helpful, and it’s our goal to have more brands target Home Assistant in their development. Another handy part of being certified is getting more access to pre-test new devices and SDK revisions, which will help development going forward.</p>\n<h3>Why two certifications (and the server add-on)</h3>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-matter-certification/ohf-matter.png' alt=\"Open Home Foundation Matter Server is certified\"/>So much fun we did it twice</p>\n<p>If you’re confused why we certified both Home Assistant and Open Home Foundation Matter Server, there are a couple of legal/procedural reasons, but it comes with some useful benefits. We certified the server as a standalone component to allow any project to use it. Each project that uses it, including Home Assistant, will have to go through a certification process to acknowledge that it uses a certified component as a “User Interface Component”. Certification for the Open Home Foundation Matter Server means it properly connects and communicates with other Matter devices, while certification for Home Assistant is about being able to display the Matter trademark.</p>\n<p>This separation is important because it means that we won’t need to go through recertification every time we update Home Assistant. This way we can keep the Matter-related backend isolated in both a software and certification sense. This is also why we will need to continue to have the Open Home Foundation Matter Server as an add-on, and it cannot be built into <a href=\"/installation/#about-installation-methods\">Home Assistant Core</a>.</p>\n<h2>The road to certification</h2>\n<p>Becoming Matter certified was not easy. When we started certification, the process was tooled up to test and certify devices, not Matter controllers, let alone completely software-based (and open source) controllers. We chose to collaborate with <a href=\"https://www.resillion.com/services/conformance-interoperability/wireless-product-testing/matter-certification/\">Resillion</a> for our certification. They are a testing and certification house based in Belgium with a lot of experience certifying Matter products. They do the formal testing and submit the results to the CSA. Together, we collaborated to write thousands of lines of test scripts, ensuring that as many test cases as possible were automated.</p>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-matter-certification/lab.jpg' alt=\"Marcel van der Veldt at the Resillion lab\"/>My visit to Resillion's lab, I brought my own lab coat</p>\n<p>We really appreciate Resillion for taking on this challenge. Not only were we the first controller they certified, but we also went for all the device types in the Matter 1.3 specification. This was a huge effort for all involved, but now that these test scripts exist, they only require minor updates for each new version; we can reuse them whenever we need to recertify.</p>\n<div class=\"alert\">\n    <p>“At Resillion, we strongly support interoperability in connected home technology, and assure, secure and innovate to help make this technology work for everyone. For us, this was not only a fantastic way to contribute to the Home Assistant open-source project, but also upgrade our own Home Assistant instances with Matter, as enthusiasts of the project running active instances of HA in our own homes.</p>\n    <p>“Working on a controller utilizing the full Matter 1.3 feature set presents a great opportunity to advance HA and Matter, and we look forward to supporting the developed codebase and further contributing to an open smart home.”</p>\n    <em style=\"text-align: right; display: block;\">- Jan Claes, Head of testing services - C&I Global, Resillion</em>\n</div>\n<p>This is another example of something that’s only possible because of the support we get from users subscribing to <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a>. Certification would be very difficult for any other open-source project, but we have the funding first to build a great server and also to pay for the required testing. Now this open source implementation exists and can be used by any project looking to add Matter.</p>\n<h2>The future Matters</h2>\n<p>As we continue improving our Matter implementation, the Matter standard itself is also evolving. Even with the progress it has made in the past year, there are still challenges to overcome. Matter is completely built on IPv6, and its rollout is uncovering the poor state of IPv6 support in today’s network hardware. Also, as it’s a complicated standard, it can be difficult to explain concepts like Thread and Fabrics to the average user, but hopefully users won’t need to be experts in the future to get the most out of Matter in their homes.</p>\n<p>Some might call Matter the smart home standard to replace all others, but we believe that there’s room for multiple standards, each providing its own unique benefits. We are focused on providing the highest support for all local smart home standards (<a href=\"/blog/2024/11/15/roadmap-2024h2/#open-protocols\">certifying other standards is on our roadmap</a>) and ensuring they work far into the future, which is great for consumer choice and sustainability.</p>\n<p>As Home Assistant grows and takes important steps like certification, the more credibility we gain in the industry—it’s a virtuous circle that helps us and Open Home projects continuously improve. Thanks for your support and helping us make this possible 🙏.</p>\n<p><strong>Try the Matter in Home Assistant today:</strong>\n<a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=matter\"><img src='https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"!Open your Home Assistant instance and show the dashboard of an add-on.\"></a></p>\n",

This allows you to add a title and welcoming text to your dashboards\nusing Markdown and even templates. Additionally, this gives you a lot of space\nfor badges next to the header.</p>\n<p>As always, we’ve baked in a lot of customization, with the ability to align the\nheader in multiple different ways. It comes with a responsive layout by default,\nbut you can also set it to always be left-aligned or center-aligned.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-03/dashboard-view-header.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new header feature in the dashboard view.\" />\n<p>The badges can also be positioned below the text (default) or above the text. A\ngreat visual menu makes it easy to choose how you want to organize your header.</p>\n<h2>Tile cards</h2>\n<p>This release has made many improvements and fine touches to the tile card. It\nis one of the most versatile cards in Home Assistant,\nand we have made it even better!</p>\n<h3>Making tile card interactions clearer</h3>\n<p>There is no doubt the tile card can do a lot, but ever since its creation,\nit has had a little flaw that you might have run into yourself…</p>\n<p>How would you know if tapping the icon on the tile card would trigger\nan action or whether it would just display more information? We have addressed\nthis with some subtle visual language in this release!</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-03/tile-card-clear-interactions.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing tile cards with and without direct actions on their icons. The ones that do have a direct action have a circular background, others don't.\" />\n<p>When tapping the icon on the tile card directly performs an action,\nlike for example, turning on a light, the icon will have a circular background\naround it. In all other cases, the little circle will not be displayed.</p>\n<p>Now you know! 👍</p>\n<h3>Position tile card features</h3>\n<p>Since <a href=\"/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/#resize-the-cards-on-your-dashboard\">we added support for resizing cards</a>,\nwe gained the ability to make very wide tile cards. These cards have a lot of\nempty space surrounding them, which can be helpful at times.</p>\n<p>But what if you could do something useful with that space? Now you can!\nAll features of a tile card can now be positioned inline in the tile card!</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-03/tile-card-inline-features.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showcasing the new inline tile card features (versus the existing bottom feature\" />\n<p>This brings a completely new look and feel, which we are sure you will love!\nFrom the settings, you can add a feature, like a brightness slider, and position\nit either below (bottom) or to the right side of the icon (inline).</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-note\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>\n  <div class=\"alert-content\">\n<p>Only the first feature can be positioned inline; the rest will not be displayed.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>New tile card features</h3>\n<p>This release also ships with two new tile card features that can be\nadded to your entities to provide new controls. <a href=\"https://github.com/jpbede\">@jpbede</a> contributed these,\nso a big shout out to him!</p>\n<h4>Switch toggle</h4>\n<p>The first addition is one that is just surprising we didn’t have it before:\nA switch toggle! This allows you to toggle a switch entity directly from the\ntile card.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-03/tile-card-switch-toggle.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new tile card feature for switch entities.\" />\n<h4>Counter actions</h4>\n<p>The second addition is a counter toggle. This allows you to add a button to\nincrease, decrease, or reset a counter entity directly from the tile card.</p>\n<img class=\" no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-03/tile-card-counter-actions.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new tile card feature for counter helper entities.\"/>\n<h3>Tiny interaction improvements</h3>\n<p>More tweaks to the tile card have been made to improve their interaction\nexperience. For example, we now have nice little animations when you hover over\nthe tile card, making it more apparent that it is interactive. Still, when you\ntap the tile card, it will show a little animation to indicate that the\ntap was registered.</p>\n<center>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-03/tile-card-interactions.gif\" alt=\"Screenrecording showing the new tiny micro interactions added to the tile card and a small demo of using keyboard navigation\" />\n</center>\n<p>Another nice addition is that the tile card can now interact with your keyboard!\nTab and shift + tab your way across the screen like the keyboard warrior you are.</p>\n<h3>Editor improvements</h3>\n<p>Not just the tile card itself has been improved, but also the editor for\nthe tile card has been improved.

They only respond once the entire reply is generated, which can take\nfrustratingly long for lengthy responses (you’ll be waiting a while if you ask\nit to tell you an epic fairy tale).</p>\n<p>We’ve added support for LLMs to stream their response to the text chat, allowing you\nto start reading while the response is being generated. A bonus side effect is\nthat commands are now also faster: they will be executed as soon as they come\nin, without waiting for the rest of the message to be complete.</p>\n<p><lite-youtube videoid=\"k6VvzDSI8RU\" videoStartAt=\"3239\" videotitle=\"Voice - Chapter 9\"></lite-youtube></p>\n<p>There was quite a lot more to tell around Assist and the new voice features;\nin case you missed it, you can read all about it in this blog post:</p>\n<p>📰 <a href=\"/blog/2025/02/13/voice-chapter-9-speech-to-phrase/\">Speech-to-Phrase brings voice home - Voice chapter 9</a></p>\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

Nice!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SmartThings</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"/integrations/smartthings\">SmartThings</a> integration has been completely rewritten! 🎉 In December,\nSmartThings shut down the old authentication method, but thanks to\nSmartThings’ hard work and close collaboration with us, <a href=\"https://github.com/joostlek\">@joostlek</a> was able to\nbring back the integration—better than ever.</p>\n<p>No more setting up routing, exposing ports, or creating developer accounts with\naccess tokens—<strong>just log in with your Samsung account</strong>, and you’re good to go!</p>\n<p>And there’s more! Push updates now work without exposing your instance to the\ninternet, making the experience faster, seamless, and more secure! 🚀</p>\n<p>A huge shoutout to our amazing community, who played a key role in this effort!\n💙 When <a href=\"https://github.com/joostlek\">@joostlek</a> shared a guide on gathering test data, the community\nstepped up—sending in valuable test data that helped fine-tune the integration.\nThis collaboration truly made a difference!</p>\n<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>\n<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other\nnoteworthy changes this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ever upgraded Home Assistant and needed to do a hard refresh in your\nbrowser to make it work again? We have been able to reduce the cases in\nwhich this happens! Thanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/bramkragten\">@bramkragten</a>!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/balloob\">@balloob</a> made a small change with a big impact.

Thanks!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Iterating on the legends of graphs</h2>\n<p>Last release, we made <a href=\"/blog/2025/02/05/release-20252/#preparing-our-graphs-for-the-future\">quite a big change to the charts</a>\nby replacing the software we use to make these graphs in Home Assistant. Things\nchanged behind the scenes, but our aim to start was to make it look\nand feel similar.</p>\n<p>However, we received a lot of feedback from the community that the legends shown\non the new graphs were suboptimal. Our UX and frontend teams have been working\nhard to improve this situation and make the new graph legends more similar\nto the old ones.</p>\n<center>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"A screen recording showing expanding and collapsing the legend\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-03/graph-legend.gif\"/>\n</center>\n<p>By default, we show the legend below the graph and show as many data points\nas possible. If there are too many, they will be displayed on demand using the\nlittle ellipsis button.</p>\n<p>When using these cards on your dashboard, if you want to always show the full\nlegend, a new option will allow you to keep it fully visible.</p>\n<p>You can now also zoom in and out, by double clicking on a graph. If you want\nmore control over the range you want to view in your graph, you can press the\nctrl/cmd key and then select the range on the graph you want to zoom in on.</p>\n<h2>Grouping/clustering of trackables on the maps</h2>\n<p>The map card is perfect for visualizing your entities’ locations, but when too\nmany cluster together in the same spot, it can get a bit cluttered.</p>\n<p>To tackle this, we’ve introduced marker clustering, which groups nearby entities\ntogether, making it easier to see them at a glance. When zooming in, the markers\n‘spider’ out, showing individual entity locations with a connecting line to\ntheir original positions. You can temporarily disable clustering with a\nsimple toggle.</p>\n<p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jpbede\">@jpbede</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/marcinbauer85\">@marcinbauer85</a> for this awesome improvement!</p>\n<center>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"The map now nicely clusters the items on the same location. This animation shows the ability to expand the cluster of items.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-03/map-marker-clustering.gif\"/>\n</center>\n<h2>Patch releases</h2>\n<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.3 in March.\nThese patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch\nrelease every Friday.</p>\n<h3>2025.3.1 - March 7</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Check support for demand load control in SmartThings AC (<a href=\"https://github.com/Ishima\">@Ishima</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/139616\">#139616</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix Unit of Measurement for Squeezebox duration sensor entity on LMS service (<a href=\"https://github.com/peteS-UK\">@peteS-UK</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/139861\">#139861</a>)</li>\n<li>Trim the Schema allowed keys to match the Public Gemini API docs.

If you’re <a href=\"/blog/2024/05/09/music-assistant-2/#what-is-music-assistant\">unfamiliar with Music Assistant</a>, it allows you to merge your libraries from leading audio streaming providers and local files, letting you play them on the most popular smart speakers. Since our <a href=\"/blog/2024/05/09/music-assistant-2/\">last update</a>, Music Assistant has had a couple of big releases, but our most recent might just be our platinum record 💿, with a lot of new functionality coming in version 2.4. In case you’ve missed the last few updates, here are the biggest additions.</p>\n<p><strong>Table of contents</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#say-my-name\">Optimized for Assist</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#across-the-universe\">External audio &amp; Spotify Connect</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#radio-ga-ga\">Podcasts &amp; Audiobooks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#new-sensation\">More players and providers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#all-about-that-bass\">Equalizer control &amp; features</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#master-of-puppets\">Home Assistant improvements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#d-d-dont-dont-stop-the-beat\">More stable streaming</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#drop-it-like-its-hot\">Get Music Assistant 2.4 today!</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>“Say My Name”</h3>\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;\">Optimized for Assist</h4>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/voice_ma.jpg' alt=\"audiobooks page\"/>We should have called it Hi-Fi edition</p>\n<p>The most recent release has some great advancements for <a href=\"/voice_control/\">Assist</a> devices, like the <a href=\"/voice-pe/\">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a>. We’ve been working closely with the <a href=\"https://esphome.io/\">ESPHome</a> team to ensure the most optimal audio streaming experience, which has helped make Assist devices into very capable media players. The community has even added some great functionality to fully <a href=\"https://github.com/music-assistant/voice-support\">control your media player with your voice</a>, including choosing songs, artists, and more. Voice Preview Edition has a high-quality DAC that provides very clean audio playback from its 3.5mm jack, allowing you to stream lossless audio to connected speakers (this $59 device puts some of my expensive Hi-Fi gear to shame!).</p>\n<h3>“Across the Universe”</h3>\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;\">External audio & Spotify Connect</h4>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/spotify_connect.jpg' alt=\"Spotify Connect on a Voice PE\"/>Spotify Connect on Voice Preview Edition</p>\n<p>Another feature in the latest release is support for “external audio sources”, which can be provided either by players themselves (source control) or with plugins. The first plugin to deliver this functionality is Spotify Connect. It’s the easiest way to use Spotify with Music Assistant, and can be enabled on any player. This makes any Music Assistant supported device a Spotify Connect supported device (can confirm, Voice Preview Edition is great for this). <a href=\"https://www.music-assistant.io/plugins/spotify-connect/\">To get started</a> go to Music Assistant’s settings, add the Spotify Connect Plugin, choose the devices you would like it to use, and within Spotify you will see the device as a player. Just note, Spotify Connect requires a Premium account to work.</p>\n<p>We’ve got our sights set on adding even more plugins like this down the line (AirPlay, anyone?). We’re also hard at work making the whole setup process super simple, particularly for those using the Voice Preview Edition who might not need every single Music Assistant feature, but still want this simple casting capability.</p>\n<h3>“Radio Ga Ga”</h3>\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;\">Podcasts & Audiobooks</h4>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/audiobooks.png' alt=\"audiobooks page\"/>The full book's progress is tracked, and chapters are clearly shown</p>\n<p>Your library just got a whole lot bigger! Music Assistant now has native support for podcasts and audiobooks. For podcasts, several providers have been added, including <a href=\"https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/subsonic/\">Subsonic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/youtube-music/\">YouTube</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/podcastfeed/\">RSS feeds</a>. Audiobooks can be added via two brand new providers: <a href=\"https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/audible/\">Audible</a> and <a href=\"https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/audiobookshelf/\">Audiobookshelf</a>, or imported directly from your local files. Audiobook playback presents the entire book as a single bar with dots showing each chapter (even if the book is separated into multiple files), allowing you to really track your progress. The entire core has been adjusted to keep better track of your progress through any media, so you will always resume where you left off.</p>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/continue.png' alt=\"Continue listening section\"/>The \"Continue listening\" section on the home page takes you back to where you left off</p>\n<h3>“New Sensation”</h3>\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;\">More players and providers</h4>\n<p>Shortly after our last blog post, we added support for <a href=\"https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> which was one of the most requested additions in the comments. A couple of other new providers were added, including <a href=\"https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/ibroadcast/\">iBroadcast</a> and <a href=\"https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/siriusxm/\">SiriusXM</a>. For new hardware support we’ve added support for <a href=\"https://www.music-assistant.io/player-support/bluesound/\">Bluesound</a> players. If you have a provider or player you love and want to see it in Music Assistant, <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/music-assistant/discussions?discussions_q=sort%3Atop\">request it</a>—but better yet <a href=\"https://github.com/music-assistant/server\">join us in developing it</a>!</p>\n<h3>“All About That Bass”</h3>\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;\">Equalizer control & features</h4>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/eq.png' alt=\"PEQ page\"/>Make your own EQ settings or import pre-made settings for your speaker</p>\n<p>When we released 2.0 there were basic bass and treble controls for devices, but with our new <a href=\"https://www.music-assistant.io/audiopipeline/\">configurable DSP</a> (Digital Signal Processor) you can now fine-tune your audio like never before. This includes input and output gain, along with a powerful <a href=\"https://www.music-assistant.io/dsp/parametriceq/\">parametric equalizer</a> that can be applied per player 📈. You can conveniently view the entire audio pipeline by clicking the quality indicator icon.</p>\n<p><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/audio_path.png' alt=\"Music Assistants next big hit\" class='no-shadow' /></p>\n<p>Another useful feature added was a “<a href=\"https://www.music-assistant.io/usage/#:~:text=Don%27t%20Stop%20The%20Music%20(DSTM)\">Don’t stop the music</a>” mode that keeps music playing even once your queue finishes, playing similar songs from your library. Another way to keep the music playing is through lock screens and widget controls built into many popular operating systems, which can now control Music Assistant.</p>\n<h3>“Master of Puppets”</h3>\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;\">Home Assistant improvements</h4>\n<p>Home Assistant was always designed to work seamlessly with Music Assistant, and it’s only getting better. In the <a href=\"/blog/2024/12/04/release-202412/#new-integrations\">Home Assistant 2024.12 release</a>, we gave the community a Christmas present–Music Assistant moved from HACS to being a native integration (<a href=\"https://www.music-assistant.io/integration/migrate/\">please migrate if you haven’t yet</a>).</p>\n<p>Many people now add all their players to Music Assistant first and then integrate Music Assistant with Home Assistant, eliminating the need to add each device separately. The most recent release added the ability to outsource any player control, including volume or turning it on/off, to a Home Assistant entity. There are other benefits to using them together, like Music Assistant <a href=\"https://www.music-assistant.io/integration/announcements/\">resuming audio playback</a> after an announcement or using Assist to find and play a song (<a href=\"https://github.com/music-assistant/voice-support\">with or without LLMs</a>).</p>\n<h3>“D-D-Don’t Don’t Stop the Beat”</h3>\n<h4 style=\"margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;\">More stable streaming</h4>\n<p>One of the biggest goals for every release is to improve streaming stability across all providers and players. With every release, we’ve been improving stability, and since our last post, we’ve had a big influx of users who have been finding and helping squash bugs. There have been nice improvements to almost every provider helping with stability, speed, and quality. Just in the next patch release 2.4.3, we’ve improved streaming performance on slower network connections. The goal is that the music never stops.</p>\n<h2>“Praise You” - 🙏</h2>\n<p>A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to this release—whether through code, testing, or feedback.

To run this software you needed at least a 133 MHz Pentium processor, 32 MB of RAM, and Windows 95 or later. Nearly thirty years later, Speech-to-Text is much better, but needs orders of magnitude more resources.</p>\n<p>Incredible technologies are being developed in speech processing, but it’s currently unrealistic for a device that costs less than $100 to take real advantage of them. It’s possible, of course, but running the previously recommended Speech-to-Text tool, <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/whisper\">Whisper</a>, on a Raspberry Pi 4 takes at least 5 seconds to turn your speech into text, with varying levels of success. This is why we ended up recommending at least an Intel N100 to run your voice assistant fully locally. That stung. Our opt-in analytics shows over <a href=\"https://analytics.home-assistant.io/\">50% of the Home Assistant OS users</a> are running their homes on affordable, low-powered machines like the <a href=\"/green\">Home Assistant Green</a> or a Raspberry Pi.</p>\n<p>What’s more, advancing the development of Whisper is largely in the hands of OpenAI, as we don’t have the resources required to add languages to that tool. We could add every possible language to Home Assistant, but if any single part of our voice pipeline lacks language support, it renders voice unusable for that language. As a result, many widely spoken languages were unsupported for local voice control.</p>\n<p>This left many users unable to use voice to control their smart home without purchasing extra hardware or services. We’re changing this today with the launch of a key new piece of our voice pipeline.</p>\n<h2>Voice for the masses</h2>\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-02-voice-chapter-9/stp-logo.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Speech-to-Phrase logo\">\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/OHF-voice/speech-to-phrase\">Speech-to-Phrase</a> is based on old, almost ancient, voice technology by today’s standards. Instead of the ability to transcribe virtually any speech into text, it is limited to a set of pre-trained phrases. Speech-to-Phrase will automatically generate the phrases and fine-tune a model based on the devices, areas, and sentence triggers in your Home Assistant server - 100% locally and offline.</p>\n<p><strong>The result:</strong> speech transcribed in under a second on a Home Assistant Green or Raspberry Pi 4. The Raspberry Pi 5 processes commands seven times faster, clocking in at 150 milliseconds per command!</p>\n<p>With great speed comes <em>some</em> limitations. Speech-to-Phrase only supports a subset of Assist’s voice commands, and more open-ended things like shopping lists, naming a timer, and broadcasts are not usable out of the box. Really any commands that can accept random words (wildcards) will not work. For the same reasons, Speech-to-Phrase is intended for home control only and not LLMs.</p>\n<p>The most important home control commands are supported, including turning lights on and off, changing brightness and color, getting the weather, setting timers, and controlling media players. <a href=\"/docs/automation/trigger/#sentence-trigger\">Custom sentences</a> can also be added to trigger things not covered by the current commands, and we expect the community will come up with some clever new ways to use this tech.</p>\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-02-voice-chapter-9/green-pe.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Green and Voice PE join forces\">\n<p align=\"center\"><em>All you need to get started with voice</em></p>\n<p>Speech-to-Phrase is launching with support for English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, and Italian - covering nearly 70% of Home Assistant users. Nice. Unlike the local Speech-to-Text tools currently available, adding languages to Speech-to-Phrase is much easier. This means many more languages will be available in future releases, and <a href=\"/voice_control/contribute-voice\">we would love your help</a> adding them!</p>\n<p>We’re working on updating the Voice wizard to include Speech-to-Phrase. Until then, you need to install the add-on manually:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=core_speech-to-phrase\"><img src='https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_addon.svg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"!Open your Home Assistant instance and show the dashboard of an add-on.\"></a></p>\n<h2>Building an Open Voice Ecosystem</h2>\n<p>When we launched Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition, we didn’t just launch a product; we kickstarted an ecosystem. We did this by open-sourcing all parts and ensuring that the voice experience built into Home Assistant is not tied to a single product. Any voice assistant built for the Open Home ecosystem can take advantage of all this work. Even your DIY ones!</p>\n<p>With ESPHome 2025.2, which we’re releasing next week, any ESPHome-based voice assistant will support making <a href=\"/blog/2025/02/05/release-20252/#new-broadcast-intent\">broadcasts</a> (more on that below), and they will also be able to use our new voice wizard to ensure new users have everything they need to get started.</p>\n<p>This will include updates for the <a href=\"/voice_control/thirteen-usd-voice-remote/\">$13 Atom Echo</a> and ESP32-S3-Box-3 devices that we used for development during the Year of the Voice!</p>\n<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid=\"HMqXHN0KBQM\" videotitle=\"New broadcast feature in action with Atom and Box 3\"></lite-youtube>New broadcast feature in action with Atom and Box 3</p>\n<h2>Large language model improvements</h2>\n<p>We aim for Home Assistant to be <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/07/ai-agents-for-the-smart-home/\">the place for experimentation with AI in the smart home</a>. We support a wide range of models, both local and cloud-based, and are constantly improving the different ways people can interact with them. We’re always running <a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports\">benchmarks</a> to track the best models, and make sure our changes lead to an improved experience.</p>\n<p>If you set up <a href=\"/voice_control/\">Assist</a>, Home Assistant’s built-in voice assistant, and configure it to use an LLM, you might have noticed some new features landing recently. One major change was the new “<a href=\"/blog/2024/12/04/release-202412/#let-your-voice-assistant-fall-back-to-an-llm-based-agent\">prefer handling commands locally</a>” setting, which always attempts to run commands with the built-in conversation agent before it sends it off to an LLM. We noticed many easy-to-run commands were being sent to an LLM, which can slow down things and waste tokens. If Home Assistant understands the command (e.g., turn on the lights), it will perform the necessary action, and only passes it on to your chosen LLM if it doesn’t understand the command (e.g., what’s the air quality like now).</p>\n<p>Adding the above features made us realize that LLMs need to understand the commands handled locally. Now, the <a href=\"/blog/2025/02/05/release-20252/#shared-history-between-the-default-conversation-agent-and-its-llm-based-fallback\">conversation history is shared</a> with the LLM. The context allows you to ask the LLM for follow-up questions that refer to recent commands, regardless of whether they helped process the request.</p>\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-02-voice-chapter-9/shared-history.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Speech-to-Phrase logo\">\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Left: without shared conversations. Right: Shared conversations enable GPT to understand context.</em></p>\n<h3>Reducing the time to first word with streaming<!-- omit in toc --></h3>\n<p>When experimenting with larger models, or on slower hardware, LLM’s can feel sluggish. They only respond once the entire reply is generated, which can take frustratingly long for lengthy responses (you’ll be waiting a while if you ask it to tell you an epic fairy tale).</p>\n<p>In Home Assistant 2025.3 we’re introducing support for LLMs to stream their response to the chat, allowing users to start reading while the response is being generated. A bonus side effect is that commands are now also faster: they will be executed as soon as they come in, without waiting for the rest of the message to be complete.</p>\n<p>Streaming is coming initially for Ollama and OpenAI.</p>\n<h3>Model Context Protocol brings Home Assistant to every AI<!-- omit in toc --></h3>\n<p>In November 2024, Anthropic announced the <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction\">Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP). It is a new protocol to allow LLMs to control external services. In this release, contributed by <a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter\">Allen Porter</a>, Home Assistant can speak MCP.</p>\n<p>Using the new Model Context Protocol <a href=\"/integrations/mcp\">integration</a>, Home Assistant can integrate external MCP servers and make their tools available to LLMs that Home Assistant talks to (for your voice assistant or in automations). There is <a href=\"https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers\">quite a collection of MCP servers</a>, including wild ones like scraping websites (<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/allenporter/b0e9946feb2ab60901c4f467ac1ba6f9\">tutorial</a>), file server access, or even BlueSky.</p>\n<p>With the new Model Context Protocol <a href=\"/integrations/mcp_server\">server integration</a>, Home Assistant’s LLM tools can be included in other AI apps, like the Claude desktop app (<a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user\">tutorial</a>). If agentic AI takes off, your smart home will be ready to be integrated.</p>\n<p>Thanks Allen!</p>\n<h2>Expanding Voice Capabilities</h2>\n<p>We keep enhancing the capabilities of the built-in conversation agent of Home Assistant. With the latest release, we’re unlocking two new features:</p>\n<h4>“Broadcast that it’s time for dinner”<!-- omit in toc --></h4>\n<p>The new <a href=\"/blog/2025/02/05/release-20252/#new-broadcast-intent\">broadcast</a> feature lets you quickly send messages to the other Assist satellites in your home. This makes it possible to announce it’s time for dinner, or announce battles between your children 😅.</p>\n<h4>“Set the temperature to 19 degrees”<!-- omit in toc --></h4>\n<p>Previously Assist could only tell you the temperature, but now it can help you change the temperature of your HVAC system. Perfect for changing the temperature while staying cozy under a warm blanket.</p>\n<h2>Home Assistant phones home: analog phones are back!</h2>\n<p>Two years ago, we introduced the <a href=\"/voice_control/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/\">world’s most private voice assistant</a>: an analog phone! Users can pick it up to talk to their smart home, and only the user can hear the response. A fun feature we’re adding today is that Home Assistant can now <strong>call your analog phone!</strong></p>\n<p>Analog phones are great when you want to notify a room, instead of an entire home. For instance, when the laundry is done, you can notify someone in the living room, but not the office. Also since the user needs to pick up the horn to receive the call, you will know if your notification was received.</p>\n<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid=\"TaoNY1gINWc\" videotitle=\"Have your Home Assistant give you a call\"></lite-youtube>Have your Home Assistant give you a call</p>\n<p>If you’re using an LLM as your voice assistant, you can also start a conversation from a phone call. You can provide the opening sentence and via a new “extra system prompt” option, provide extra context to the LLM to interpret the response from the user. For example,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extra system context: garage door cover.garage_door was left open for 30 minutes. We asked the user if it should be closed</li>\n<li>Assistant: should the garage door be closed?</li>\n<li>User: sure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jaminh\">JaminH</a> for the contribution.</p>\n<h2>Wyoming improvements</h2>\n<p>Wyoming is our standard for linking together all the different parts needed to build a voice assistant. Home Assistant 2025.3 will add support for announcements to Wyoming satellites, making them eligible for the new broadcast feature too.  </p>\n<p>We’re also adding a new microWakeWord add-on (the same wake word engine running on Voice PE!) that can be used as an alternative to openWakeWord. As we collect more real-world samples from our <a href=\"https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/\">Wake Word Collective</a>, the models included in microWakeWord will be retrained and improved.</p>\n<h2>🫵 Help us bring choice to voice!</h2>\n<p>We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again—the era of open voice has begun, and the more people who join us, the better it gets. Home Assistant offers many ways to start with voice control, whether by <a href=\"/voice_control/#expand-and-experiment\">building your own</a> Assist hardware or getting a <a href=\"/voice-pe/\">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a>. With every update, you’ll see new features, and you’ll get to preview the future of voice today.</p>\n<p>A huge thanks to all the language leaders and contributors helping to shape open voice in the home! There are many ways to get involved, from translating or sharing voice samples to building new features—learn more about how <a href=\"/voice_control/contribute-voice\">you can contribute here</a>.

That release set the\nstage for the next iterations and opened up the ability for integrations to\nprovide locations to store backups.</p>\n<p>We’ve received <strong>a lot</strong> of feedback on the new backup system, which is awesome! ❤️\nAll the feedback helped us prioritize the most requested features, and other\nimprovements to the backup system.</p>\n<p>This release includes a lot of the most requested improvements and abilities.</p>\n<h3>Unencrypted backups</h3>\n<p>The new backup system came with a lot of security improvements, including\nencryption of backups. However, as it turns out, many users use these backups\nto extract and restore single files or configurations, a use case in which\nencryption made things more difficult. In this release we made two changes\nto the backup system to address this.</p>\n<h4>Ability to turn off encryption for specific locations</h4>\n<p>While our default recommendation remains to encrypt backups, as of this\nrelease, you can turn off encryption on a per location basis. This allows you\nto store backups on you local NAS, for example, in an unencrypted format.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the option to turn off encryption for a specific backup location.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-02/backups-turn-off-encryption.png\" />\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the backup locations, one location indicates that encryption has been turned off.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-02/backups-encryption-turned-off.png\" />\n<p>There is one exception to this, which is <a href=\"/cloud\">Home Assistant Cloud</a>. Backups\nstored in Home Assistant Cloud will always be encrypted, and encryption cannot\nbe turned off. At Nabu Casa, we take your privacy and security very seriously,\nand we never ever want to be able to access your data.</p>\n<h4>Downloading backups unencrypted</h4>\n<p>When downloading backups from the Home Assistant interface, you will now always\ndownload the backup in an unencrypted format that can be extracted using your\nfavorite archive tool.</p>\n<p>This works for all backups, regardless of the encryption settings of the\nlocation in which they are stored. For instance, if you download an encrypted\nbackup from Home Assistant Cloud through the Home Assistant interface,\nit will decrypt the backup on the fly while you download it.</p>\n<h3>Customize the time of your backups</h3>\n<p>The initial iteration of the backup system scheduled backups to run at 4:45 AM,\nbut this time wasn’t ideal for everyone. Some, for example, turned off their\nnetwork storage during the night, meaning the backup would fail.</p>\n<p>This release, we added the ability to customize the time of your backups to your\nliking. Additionally, if you choose to make weekly backups, you can now select\nthe days of the week you want the backup to run.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the backup configuration options, you can now set your own time and select which days to backup.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-02/backups-customize-backups-change.png\" />\n<h3>Taking backups on an advanced schedule</h3>\n<p>The above backup time changes not flexible enough for you? Well, you are in luck! In this\nrelease, we added an action (<code>backup.create_automatic</code>) that you can use\nto trigger a backup, with your preferred settings, in an automation.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing an automation in the automation editor that is using the new action to create an automated backup.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-02/backups-action.png\" />\n<p>This allows you to create automated backups on any schedule you like, or even\nadd conditions and actions around it. For example, you could make an automation\nthat triggers on a calendar, wakes up your network storage, waits till it is\nonline, and then starts a backup.</p>\n<h3>Re-introduction of the backup toggle on update</h3>\n<p>If you run Home Assistant OS, you get updates for Home Assistant along with\nall your add-ons. The update dialog used to have a toggle to create a backup\nbefore updating, which was removed in the previous release.</p>\n<p>This change was made because this feature was considered redundant when running\nregular automated backups. However, we’ve received a lot of feedback that many\npeople relied on these backups to ensure they had the latest data, for instance,\nif they needed to roll back to a previous version of an add-on. We are\nre-introducing this backup on update toggle in this release, but in a smarter\nway. 🤓</p>\n<h4>Backup on updating Home Assistant</h4>\n<p>When updating Home Assistant, the toggle is now turned off by default and\nshows the last time you made a backup. This allows you to decide whether to make\na new backup before updating.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing an Home Assistant Core update dialog, giving the option to make a backup before update.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-02/backups-before-update-core.png\" />\n<p>If you turn the switch on, a full automated backup is created and synced to\nyour configured locations, before the update is started.</p>\n<p>This full sync is done to ensure you have the most recent backup available in\ncase the update causes issues and you need to restore your system. In the rare\ncase a Home Assistant update fatally fails and you can’t access the backup page,\nif you’ve configured a second backup location, you’ll be able to download it\nfrom there.</p>\n<h4>Backup on updating add-ons</h4>\n<p>Things are slightly different when updating add-ons. The toggle exists here too,\nand is disabled by default. However, when you enable it, only a backup of your\nadd-on and its data is created. That way you can keep around the previous\nversion of the add-on, so you can always roll back to it if needed.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing an Home Assistant add-on update dialog, giving the option to make a backup before update.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-02/backups-addons-before-update.png\" />\n<p>To prevent your system from filling up with old add-on backups, we only retain\none backup per add-on, automatically deleting the previous backup whenever\na new one is created. Add-on backups you created manually, of course,\nremain untouched and will not be deleted automatically.</p>\n<h3>Improved filenames for backups</h3>\n<p>One piece of feedback we’ve seen a lot, is that the filenames created by backups\ncan be a bit cryptic and hard to understand for humans.</p>\n<p>This feedback was fair, as the filename was a hash and originally not designed\nto be human-readable. This method was not newly introduced in the last release,\nbut it was made more apparent with the new backup system and locations.</p>\n<p>So, in this release, we’ve improved the filenames of the backups stored on your\nbackup locations. The filename now includes the date and time the backup was\ncreated, making it easier to understand and identify the backup you are looking\nfor, even outside of Home Assistant.</p>\n<h3>New locations</h3>\n<p>This release also introduces new locations to store your backups. There are new\nintegrations for <a href=\"/integrations/google_drive/\">Google Drive</a> and\n<a href=\"/integrations/onedrive/\">Microsoft OneDrive</a>, and backup support was added to\nthe <a href=\"/integrations/synology_dsm\">Synology DSM</a> integration.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the backup configuration panel, with all possible backup integrations set up!\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-02/backups-new-locations.png\" />\n<h2>Voice</h2>\n<p>Assist, our <a href=\"/voice_control/\">private voice assistant</a>, is getting a few new\nfeatures in this release. If you don’t have Assist set up yet, check out our\n<a href=\"/voice-pe/\">Home Assistant Voice: Preview Edition</a> to get started.</p>\n<h3>Home Assistant will be able to call your analog phone to tell you a message</h3>\n<p>Remember our tutorial on turning an analog phone into the\n<a href=\"/voice_control/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/\">world’s most private voice assistant</a>?\nThanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/jaminh\">Jamin</a>, we now have a way to call\nyour analog phone from Home Assistant!</p>\n<p>You can use <a href=\"/integrations/assist_satellite#action-assist_satelliteannounce\"><code>assist_satellite.announce</code></a>\nto have Home Assistant call your phone and play a message when someone picks up\nthe phone.</p>\n<p>If you use an LLM as the brains for your voice assistant, you can take this one\nstep further with the new <a href=\"/integrations/assist_satellite#action-assist_satellitestart_conversation\"><code>assist_satellite.start_conversation</code></a>\naction. Instead of playing an announcement, it starts a conversation between\nHome Assistant and the user, with Home Assistant saying the first message.\nLeft the garage door open for 30 minutes? No problem, let Home Assistant call\nand ask if they want to close it.</p>\n<p><em>(Starting a conversation with the default conversation agent is a bit more work\nand did not make it this release).</em></p>\n<h3>New Broadcast intent</h3>\n<p>You can now broadcast messages to every other voice assistant in your home.\nTry it by saying <em>“Broadcast it is time for dinner”</em>.\nAs always with new intents, support may vary\n<a href=\"https://ohf-voice.github.io/intents/\">depending on your language</a>,\nbut our language leaders are working hard on making sure it will be supported\nsoon in your language!</p>\n<h3>Setting Temperature on Thermostat</h3>\n<p>A few releases ago we introduced an intent to get the current temperature from\na climate device. As of this release, you can also set the target temperature\nof your thermostat by voice.</p>\n<p>By saying <em>“Set the temperature to 19 degrees”</em> this will smartly target the\narea you are in (if you have a thermostat per area, such as thermostatic valves\non your radiators) or the floor you are in (if you only have a central unit).\nYou can also target specific devices by name if you prefer.</p>\n<h3>LLMs meet calendars</h3>\n<p>Without complex custom tooling, LLM-based conversation agents previously could\nnot fetch events from your calendar. This release changes that. Out of the box,\nLLM-based agents can now retrieve today’s and this week’s events from any of\nyour calendars. Don’t forget to\n<a href=\"/voice_control/voice_remote_expose_devices/\">expose your calendar entities</a>\nto enable this functionality.</p>\n<h3>Shared history between the default conversation agent and its LLM-based fallback</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/blog/2024/12/04/release-202412/\">2024.12</a> we introduced a lovely feature\nthat allowed you to use our fast and local default conversation agent for most\nqueries while still being able to fall back to a much more powerful LLM-based\nagent for more complex queries.</p>\n<p>This introduced some interesting behaviors. From a user perspective, it looked\nlike you were talking to the same assistant, whereas, in reality, nothing was\nshared between the two agents. This led to some less-than-optimal scenarios,\nsuch as this one:</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of missing history in the conversation\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-02/conversation-history-before.png\" />\n<p>The first command is processed locally by our default agent, but the follow-up\nrequest is processed by the LLM-based agent. Since no memory is shared, it does\nnot understand what device you want to turn off.</p>\n<p>Starting with this release, both agents now share the same command history,\nhelping address this issue.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of the new improved behavior\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-02/conversation-history-after.png\" />\n<h3>Model Context Protocol</h3>\n<p>This release adds the <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction\">Model Context Protocol</a>\nto Home Assistant thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter\">Allen</a>. Home Assistant can both be an\n<a href=\"/integrations/mcp_server/\">MCP server</a> and an\n<a href=\"/integrations/mcp/\">MCP client</a>. From the MCP website:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To give it a try yourself, <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/allenporter/b0e9946feb2ab60901c4f467ac1ba6f9\">check out this client demo</a>.</p>\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

We have entirely replaced the software library that renders\nthese graphs in the frontend.</p>\n<p>You can most definitely tell things have changed, but everything still looks\nvery similar. The latter was our goal for now, as we wanted the existing\nexperience to be familiar.</p>\n<p>However, this change is a preparation for the future. We have many plans and\nideas for our graphs, and this change was a necessary step to make those plans\npossible.</p>\n<h2>Patch releases</h2>\n<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.2 in February.\nThese patch releases only contain bug fixes.

      "Content": "<img src='/images/blog/2025-01-backups/art.jpg' alt=\"3 2 1 backup\">\n<p>Home Assistant is a powerful tool that can save you time and money by automating your home. Pretty important things around the home, from heating to an automatic fish feeder, need to depend on it. However, as your setup grows more complex, maintaining it—what we call <em>“digital housekeeping”</em>—can become a time-consuming task. Backups are a critical part of this maintenance, yet they’re often overlooked, especially by new users, often until it is too late when disaster strikes.</p>\n<p>To make backups effortless, we’ve introduced new automated and off-site backup features in <a href=\"/blog/2025/01/03/release-20251/\">the latest release of Home Assistant</a>. These improvements will make it easier than ever to safeguard your setup. As we step into the New Year, we would encourage you to adopt a simple yet crucial resolution: regularly back up your data. With our new tools, it takes just five minutes to set up and provides lasting peace of mind.</p>\n<p>Learn more about our backups below, or get started now by <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/updates/\">updating</a> and visiting the <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/backup/\">backups</a> page.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>What’s in a backup?</h2>\n<p>Backups are essential for a reliable smart home. They protect your system from hardware failures, natural disasters, and cyberattacks, allowing you to quickly restore operations. A solid backup strategy follows the 3-2-1 rule:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3 copies of your data</li>\n<li>2 stored on different media</li>\n<li>1 kept off-site</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While this may seem excessive, consider a scenario like a lightning strike: both your Home Assistant system and any local storage, like network-attached storage (NAS), could be destroyed. That’s why an off-site backup is non-negotiable for true resilience, and a comprehensive backup strategy should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular and frequent backups of critical data</li>\n<li>Following the 3-2-1 rule for redundancy</li>\n<li>Encrypting backups to protect against theft and corruption</li>\n<li>Testing backups to ensure they are functional</li>\n<li>Defining how long backups should be retained</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To support these best practices, we have worked hard to introduce Automatic Backups and seamless integration with off-site backup location providers, such as <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a>. These updates, part of <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#home-assistant-cloud-peace-of-mind\">our 2024 roadmap</a>, make it easier than ever to provide peace of mind to our users, by implementing a robust backup strategy, and keep your smart home running smoothly.</p>\n<h2>Backups have never been this easy</h2>\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-01-backups/backups.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"the backup page\">\n<p>Home Assistant backups are incredibly good, backing up every setting and add-on, making restores feel a bit like magic. It even works across different CPU architectures! Up until recently setting up a 3-2-1 backup strategy in Home Assistant was not entirely straightforward. This changes with Home Assistant 2025.1, where we’re elevating our backup experience with three new important features.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automatic encrypted backups</strong> - You can now schedule automatic backups every night or once a week, ensuring you always have a recent backup at hand.</li>\n<li><strong>Automatic cleanup</strong> - No longer worry about backups overrunning your disk space, as you can now set the maximum number of backups that should be stored.</li>\n<li><strong>Backup locations</strong> - We have added a new system for integrations to provide backup locations (also known as <a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/platform/backup\">backup agents</a>), allowing you to sync backups to both local or off-site storage. It’s launching with support for <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/storage/\">network shares</a> and <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> (included at no additional cost to subscribers), with more locations to follow.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Get started with our Backup Wizard</h3>\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-01-backups/wizard.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"the backup wizard\">\n<p>The new automatic backup feature in Home Assistant 2025.1 comes with a new easy to use backup wizard. With a couple of clicks, you can backup your Home Assistant system on a regular schedule and easily choose the places where backups are stored. New users will be prompted with a wizard to make sure they set up automatic encrypted backups. Selecting the recommended settings ensures that a backup is made every night, that three backups are kept, and that they are uploaded to all available locations.</p>\n<h3>Backup locations</h3>\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-01-backups/locations.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"backup locations\">\n<p>At launch, only a few backup locations will be available, but we’ve made it easy for developers to integrate more, so expect a lot of options to follow. As part of this renewed focus on smart home resilience set out in <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#next-priority-encrypted-cloud-backup\">our roadmap</a>, cloud backup has been added to <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a>, which will be available day one to all subscribers for no additional cost. It will only store the latest backup, which must be under 5GB (you’ll be notified to repair it if it is too large to upload). If you lose your other backups, you can always go to <a href=\"https://account.nabucasa.com/\">your Cloud account page</a> and download the latest backup.</p>\n<p>New Home Assistant features like this supercharged backup capability is only possible with funding from our Home Assistant Cloud subscribers. Adding backup to the subscription at no additional cost, was the least we could do to thank them for their continued support.</p>\n<h3>Secure by default</h3>\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-01-backups/encrypt.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Encryption key page\">\n<p>Backups contain all Home Assistant data, including all the keys to every integrated device in your smart home and the history of how you live your life. This data is very important to keep secure. With automatic backups and the 3-2-1 approach we are promoting to users to store their backups off-site. This is why all automatic backups are fully encrypted.</p>\n<p>When a user configures automatic backups, they will be presented with the encryption key and the option to download an emergency kit. The emergency kit contains all the important information, including a link to <a href=\"/more-info/backup-emergency-kit\">the instructions on how to use it to restore a backup</a>. If you were to ever delete your emergency kit, it is available to re-download in the <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/backup/\">backup configuration page</a>.</p>\n<h4>Apply 3-2-1 to your backups</h4>\n<p><lite-youtube videoid=\"nSSkMVBqChM\" videotitle=\"How to setup automatic backups\"></lite-youtube></p>\n<p>Check out the above video tutorial or read our docs to learn more about setting up <a href=\"/integrations/backup/\">automatic and off-site backups</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Too often, people just starting their smart home journey move forward a little too fast and make a mistake that causes some downtime. This impacts the household’s confidence, as something that should be making their lives easier is actually seen as unreliable. Avoid this early pitfall and build a resilient smart home with 3-2-1 backups.</p>\n",

Let’s be honest: they’re one of the most important yet\noften overlooked tasks. But when disaster strikes, like a hardware failure,\nhaving a reliable backup can save the day. Wouldn’t you love to be back up and\nrunning after disaster strikes?</p>\n<p>While Home Assistant’s previous backup system has proven to be solid\nand reliable over the years, it didn’t exactly make following best\npractices—like regular backups, encryption, and off-site\nstorage—easy. Many of you had to rely on custom add-ons, automations,\nor blueprints for backups to fill the gaps.</p>\n<p><strong>That changes with this release! 🎉</strong></p>\n<p>We’ve completely reworked the Home Assistant backup experience to help you set\nup a solid backup strategy, using best practices in just a few clicks;\ngiving you peace of mind when it comes to your backups.</p>\n<p>No worries, if you are using any custom solution for backups, they will continue\nto work today. Even with everything new, we’ve made sure to keep everything\nbackward compatible.</p>\n<p>So, without further ado, let’s dive into the new backup system!</p>\n<h3>Automated backups 🤖</h3>\n<p>Yes, you read that right—Home Assistant now supports automated backups!</p>\n<p>Using a schedule, backups will be created on a regular basis without you having\nto lift a finger. This ensures you always have a recent backup available,\nwithout having to worry about it.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the bew backup overview page which shows you exactly when your last backup took place\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-01/backups-status.png\" />\n<p>When you navigate to your backups in the settings menu, you will be\ngreeted with a new overview page that shows you exactly when your last backup\ntook place and when the next one is scheduled. Instant peace of mind!</p>\n<p>Automated backups are taking place at 4:45 AM. So, while everyone in your home\nis sleeping, Home Assistant makes sure your data is safe and sound. Backing up\nat this early hour also means Home Assistant is done with its internal database\nmaintenance, ensuring your backup is as compact as possible.</p>\n<p>If something ever goes wrong during the automated scheduled backup process,\nHome Assistant will notify you through the repair center, ensuring you are\naware of it and can take action.</p>\n<h3>Triggering an off-schedule automated backup 👆</h3>\n<p>Automated backups on a schedule are great, but sometimes, you might want to\ntrigger a backup <strong>right now</strong>! Maybe you are about to make big changes or\nupgrade a whole bunch of things during an evening of tinkering.</p>\n<p>No worries! You can now trigger an off-schedule automated backup from the backup\npage at any time. This will immediately create a backup with the same\nconfiguration as your scheduled automated backups.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the backup now button + dialog that allows you to trigger an off-schedule backup at any time\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-01/backups-backup-now.png\" />\n<p>The ability to trigger an on-demand automated backup is excellent, as it covers\nall your backup settings in a single click. However, the ability to create\nmanual backups also still exists. This allows you to create a very specific\nbackup with the exact contents you want to have in it.</p>\n<h3>Home Assistant Cloud backups 😎</h3>\n<p>Are you a <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/\">Home Assistant Cloud by Nabu Casa</a> subscriber? Then you’re in for a\ntreat! You can now automatically store your latest, fully encrypted, backup in\nyour Home Assistant Cloud account.</p>\n<p><strong>This feature provides 5GB of storage at no extra cost, offering fully\nencrypted off-site protection for your data! 🎁</strong></p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Home Assistant Cloud is now a backup target location, that is included with the Home Assistant Cloud subscription at no additional costs\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-01/backups-home-assistant-cloud.png\" />\n<p>The backup can be downloaded from Home Assistant itself, but also from the\n<a href=\"https://account.nabucasa.com/\">Home Assistant Cloud account page</a> @ Nabu Casa\nin case you need it. This way, you can always access your latest backup, even\nin case your Home Assistant hardware completely fails.</p>\n<h3>Backup locations are extendable by design 🧩</h3>\n<p>So, automated backups can be stored on your local disk and in Home Assistant\nCloud, but what if you want to store your backups somewhere else?</p>\n<p>Choice is an important aspect of Home Assistant; we want to make everything as\nflexible as possible without vendor lock-in. Therefore, the backup system\nis designed to be <strong>extendable</strong>.</p>\n<p>This means <strong>integrations</strong> can offer new storage locations—such as NAS devices,\nGoogle Drive, Backblaze B2, or other storage providers—in the future.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing an potential example storage provider provided by an integration\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-01/backups-integration-location.png\" />\n<p>Currently, this feature is brand new ✨, so <strong>no</strong> integrations offer additional\nlocations yet. However, we expect to see a few more integrations that provide\nbackup locations in the next release.</p>\n<p>This extensibility ensures you can store your backups where you want them,\ngiving you the flexibility and choice to choose the storage solution you\nprefer and trust.</p>\n<h3>Encrypted backups by default 🔒</h3>\n<p>With the addition of Home Assistant Cloud as an off-site backup location, and\nthe potential for integrations to offer even more (off-site) backup locations,\nsecurity has become more important than ever. Your backups not only contain the\naccess credentials to your smart home devices but also the history of your home,\nand no one should be able to access information that sensitive! <strong>Ever!</strong></p>\n<p>That is why all backups are now <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard\">AES-128</a> encrypted by default. To prioritize\nyour backups’ security we replaced the previous optional password\nwith a mandatory encryption key.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"The new backup overview page shows you exactly when your last backup took place\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-01/backups-encryption.png\" />\n<p>When you set up your backups for the first time, an encryption key will be\ngenerated for you. Make sure to store this key in a safe place, as you will need\nit to restore your backups. To make this easier, you can download the key as\npart of an emergency kit during setup—or anytime later from the backup settings\npage. Keep it safe! 🔑</p>\n<h3>Restoring backups available to all installation methods 🤗</h3>\n<p>More good news—restoring backups is now supported across\n<strong>all installation methods!</strong> 🎉</p>\n<p>Previously, only Home Assistant OS installations could restore backups. But\nwith this release, this feature is now available for all installation methods!\nNo matter how you run Home Assistant, even if you use our containers in a Docker\nenvironment, you can now restore your Home Assistant backups.</p>\n<p>This also means you can restore backups from local storage, Home Assistant\nCloud, or any future backup locations added through integrations.</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, all backup features, including everything we release today,\nwill be available regardless of the installation method you are using. We want\neveryone to have a solid backup strategy.</p>\n<h3>Backup retention 🗑</h3>\n<p>Our previous backup system made solid backups, which was good, but if you didn’t\nclean them up manually, eventually, you’d annoyingly run out of disk space. 😬</p>\n<p>So! Backup retention is now a thing! You can now configure how many backups you\nwant to keep, and Home Assistant will handle the rest.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"You can now configure a retention policy for your backups, allowing Home Assistant to clean it up automatically\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-01/backups-retention.png\" />\n<p>This cleanup will happen automatically after each backup. If you create a backup\nmanually for whatever reason, those will remain untouched, giving you full\ncontrol over special cases and workflows.</p>\n<h3>Setting up backups for the first time 🚀</h3>\n<p>Getting started with the new backup system is quick and easy!</p>\n<p>The first time you open the backup settings after upgrading, you will be greeted\nby a <strong>setup wizard</strong> that will guide you through setting up your backups\nstep-by-step.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of the our friendly wizard that will help you setting up your backups\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-01/backups-wizard.png\" />\n<p>The wizard will help you set up your encryption key, configure your backup\nfrequency, and set up your backup retention policy. And when it is ready, it\nwill immediately kick off your first backup!</p>\n<p>All set! One less thing to worry about 🎉</p>\n<h3>3…2…1… Backups 🎊</h3>\n<p>We are super excited about this new backup system! As we enter the new year,\nwe encourage you to get serious about your backups.\nA good New Year’s resolution, maybe? 😉</p>\n<p>So, stop what you are doing right now and set up your backups! Go ahead and set\nup that 3-2-1 backup strategy. Not sure what that is?</p>\n<p><strong>You can read all about it in our <a href=\"/blog/2025/01/03/3-2-1-backup/\">3…2…1… Backup blog post</a>.</strong></p>\n<h2>Month of “What the Heck?!”</h2>\n<p>December’s <strong><a href=\"/blog/2024/11/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck/\">Month of “What the Heck?!”</a></strong>\nwas an absolute blast! 🎉</p>\n<p>A big thank you to everyone who contributed by sharing their “What the Heck?!”\nmoments and ideas for improving Home Assistant. Your input is incredibly\nvaluable and helps shape our roadmap and priorities moving forward.</p>\n<p>Quite a bunch of shared “What the Heck?!” moments have been addressed in this\nrelease already 🚀 —and we’re not stopping there! Expect to see even more\nimprovements inspired by your feedback in upcoming releases.</p>\n<h3>Setting categories and labels when creating automations and scripts</h3>\n<p>For the first WTH item that has been resolved, we have <a href=\"https://github.com/jpbede\">@jpbede</a> to thank!\nAnd this one is also one of the higher-voted ones, so it is a good one!\nAndrew Jackson wrote:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-can-you-not-add-categories-labels-etc-when-creating-an-automation/802562\"><em><strong>“WTH can you not add categories, labels etc when creating an automation”</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Yeah, that is a good WTH! Whenever you create a new automation or script, you\nprobably want to organize it right away and not have to go back to the settings.\n<strong>FIXED</strong>! 🎉</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"If you press the d on your keyboard, it will pop up the Quickbar for devices\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-01/wth-category-labels-new-automation.png\" />\n<p>When you create a new automation or script, and also when renaming it,\nyou can now set the description, category, labels, and areas right away!\n🏷️ Nice!</p>\n<h3>Quickly navigate to a device</h3>\n<p>You might be aware that you can bring up our quick navigation bar anywhere in\nHome Assistant by pressing the <code>c</code> key on your keyboard to navigate various\nplaces and the <code>e</code> key to search and navigate to any entity. However…</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-is-there-no-quick-bar-for-devices/802310\"><em><strong>“WTH is there no quick bar for devices?”</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Well, that is a good question that Andreas Brett raised! There is indeed no\nsuch thing for devices. <a href=\"https://github.com/jpbede\">@jpbede</a> to the rescue! You can now navigate to any\ndevice using the quick bar by pressing the <code>d</code> key on your keyboard.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"If you press the d on your keyboard, it will pop up the quick bar for devices\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-01/wth-quickbar-devices.png\"/>\n<h3>Zoom &amp; Pan for charts</h3>\n<p>KNXBroker raised the following WTH topic:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-lets-upgrade-history-graphs/802568\"><em><strong>“WTH lets upgrade History Graphs”</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>You are right! The history graphs in Home Assistant are basic but functional!\nNevertheless, we can do better! 🚀</p>\n<p>One of the bigger items in that WTH topic was the ability to zoom and pan…\nThanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/MindFreeze\">@MindFreeze</a>, you can now zoom and pan in any graph\nin Home Assistant! 📈</p>\n<p class=\"img\">\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Zoom any graph in Home Assistant, by holding ctrl or command and scrolling your mouse wheel!\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-01/wth-zoom-graphs.gif\"/>\nZoom and drag any graph in Home Assistant, by holding ctrl (or command on mac)\nand scrolling your mouse wheel!\n</p>\n<p>Hold the control key (or command on macOS) and scroll to zoom in and out using\nyour mouse. You can also click and drag to pan around the zoomed graph.</p>\n<p>In addition to this change, <a href=\"https://github.com/MindFreeze\">@MindFreeze</a> enabled small micro-animation for the\nhistory graphs, making them look more alive and less static.</p>\n<h3>Controlling the default exposure of new entities to Assist</h3>\n<p>mathd made the following point in a Month of “What the Heck?!” topic:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-are-all-new-entities-exposed-to-assist-by-default/803889\"><em>“WTH Are all new entities exposed to Assist by default?”</em></a></p>\n<p>We hear you! Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/jpbede\">@jpbede</a>, you can now control the default exposure of\nnew entities to Assist. You can now toggle this on or off in the Home Assistant\nVoice Assistant settings.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Zoom any graph in Home Assistant, by holding ctrl or command and scroll your mouse wheel!\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-01/wth-default-expose-to-assist.png\" />\n<h3>More “What the Heck?!” improvements</h3>\n<p>Many smaller improvements originate from the Month of “What the Heck?!” in this\nrelease. Here are some of the other noteworthy ones:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-there-is-no-hotkey-for-assist/802403\"><em><strong>“WTH there is no hotkey for Assist”</strong></em></a>**</p>\n<p>Well, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/jpbede\">@jpbede</a>, you can now press the <code>a</code> key on your keyboard\nanywhere in Home Assistant to summon Assist! 🎙️ Nice!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-doesnt-ha-ask-if-i-want-to-save-automations/804030\"><em><strong>“WTH doesn’t HA ask if I want to save automations?”</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Whoa! That is a good one! Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/jpbede\">@jpbede</a>, Home Assistant will now ask if\nyou want to save your automation before leaving the editor if there are unsaved\nchanges. 🤖</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-is-in-energy-dashboard-the-individual-devices-not-able-to-reorder/805051\"><em><strong>“WTH Is in Energy Dashboard the individual devices not able to reorder”</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Thanks for that one yormedia! Honestly, this one has been raised in previous\neditions of the Month of “What the Heck?!” a few times. Reason enough for\n<a href=\"https://github.com/karwosts\">@karwosts</a> to pick this up and make it happen!

In the same way Home Assistant made private and local home automation a viable option, we believe the same can, and must be done for voice assistants.</p>\n<p>Since we began developing our open-source voice assistant for Home Assistant, one key element has been missing - great hardware that’s simple to set up and use. Hardware that hears you, gives you clear feedback, and seamlessly fits into the home. Affordable and high-quality voice hardware will let more people join in on its development and allow anyone to <em>preview</em> the future of voice assistants today. Setting a standard for the next several years to base our development around.</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/vpe-packaging.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Voice Preview Edition with packaging\"></p>\n<p>We’re launching <a href=\"/voice-pe/\">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a> to help accelerate our goal of not only matching the capabilities of existing voice assistants but surpassing them. This is inevitable: They’ll focus their efforts on monetizing voice, while our community will be focused on improving open and private voice. We’ll support the languages big tech ignores and provide a real choice in how you run voice in your home.</p>\n<p><strong>The era of open, private voice assistants begins now, and we’d love for you to be part of it.</strong></p>\n<h3>Table of contents</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#introducing-home-assistant-voice-preview-edition\">Introducing Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#why-preview-edition\">Why Preview Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#built-for-home-assistant\">Built for Home Assistant</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#advanced-audio-processing\">Advanced audio processing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#bringing-choice-to-voice\">Bringing choice to voice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#fully-open-and-customizable\">Fully open and customizable</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#community-driven\">Community-driven</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#conclusion\">Conclusion</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#see-what-voice-can-do-today\">See what voice can do today</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Introducing Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</h2>\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/voice-preview-edition.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Voice Preview Edition with packaging\">\n<p>Our main goal with Voice Preview Edition was to make the best hardware to get started with <a href=\"/voice_control/\">Assist</a>, Home Assistant’s built-in voice assistant. If you’re already using other third-party hardware to run Assist, this will be a big upgrade. We prioritized its ability to hear commands, giving it an industry-leading dedicated audio processor and dual microphones - I’m always blown away by how well it picks up my voice around the room.</p>\n<p>Next, we ensured it would blend into the home, giving it a sleek but unobtrusive design. That’s not to say it doesn’t have flair. When you get your hands on Voice Preview Edition the first thing you’ll notice is its premium-feeling injection-molded shell, which is semi-transparent, just like your favorite ‘90s tech. The LED ring is also really eye-catching, and you can customize it to your heart’s content from full gamer RGB to subtle glow.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;\">\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/vpe-finish.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"3 different views of Voice Preview Edition\">\n</div>\n<p>It’s hard to convey how nice the rotary dial is to use; its subtle clicks paired with LED animations are hard not to play with. Most importantly, the dial lets anyone in your home intuitively adjust the volume. The same can be said for the multipurpose button and mute switch (which physically cuts power to the microphone for ultimate privacy). We knew for it to work best, it needed to be out in the open, and let’s just say that <a href=\"https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/open-home-approval-factor/#:~:text=2023.1%20release%20notes.-,Home%20Approval%20Factor,-We%20have%20a\">Home Approval Factor</a> was very front of mind when designing it.</p>\n<p>We also worked hard to keep the price affordable and comparable to other voice assistant hardware at just $59 (that’s the recommended MSRP, and pricing will vary by retailer). This isn’t a preorder, it’s available now!</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n<img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/vpe-price.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Voice Preview Edition price\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n  <a href=\"/voice-pe/\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2024-12-voice-chapter-8/buy-now.png\"\n         style=\"border: 0; box-shadow: none;\"\n         alt=\"buy now\">\n  </a>\n</div>\n<h3>Why Preview Edition</h3>\n<p>For some, our voice assistant is all they need; they just want to say a couple of commands, set timers, manage their shopping list, and control their most used devices. For others, we understand they want to ask their voice assistant to make whale sounds or to tell them how tall Taylor Swift is - this voice assistant doesn’t entirely do those things (<a href=\"/voice_control/assist_create_open_ai_personality/\">yet</a>). We think there is still more we can do before this is ready for every home, and until then, we’ll be selling this <em>Preview</em> of the future of voice assistants. We’ve built the best hardware on the market, and set a new standard for the coming years, allowing us to focus our development as we prepare our voice assistant for every home. Taking back our privacy isn’t for everyone - it’s a journey - and we want as many people as possible to join us early and make it better.</p>\n<h3>Built for Home Assistant</h3>\n<p>Many other voice assistants work with Home Assistant, but this one was <em>built</em> for Home Assistant. Unlike other voice hardware that can work with Assist, this doesn’t require flashing firmware or any assembly. You plug it into power, and it is seamlessly discovered by Home Assistant. A wizard instantly starts helping you set up your voice assistant, but critically, if you haven’t used voice before, it will quickly guide you through what you need to get the best experience.</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/wizard.webp' alt=\"Video of Assist wizard\">Get up and running with Voice Preview Edition in minutes with our new wizard</a>\n<p>This is not a DIY product. We’ve worked to make the experience as smooth as possible, with easy and fast updates and settings you can manage from the Home Assistant UI.</p>\n<h3>Advanced audio processing</h3>\n<p>If you have been following our work on voice, you know we’ve tried a lot of different voice assistant hardware. Most available Assist-capable hardware is bad at its most important job - hearing your voice and then providing audiovisual feedback. That was really what drove us to build Voice Preview Edition.</p>\n<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid=\"DS_8cDZKBPc\" videotitle=\"Music Assistant - VPE\"></lite-youtube>Voice Preview Editions mics and audio processors effortlessly hear commands through loud music it is playing</p>\n<p>Our Assist software could only do so much with substandard audio, and its functionality is massively improved with clear audio. The dual microphones combined with the XMOS audio processing chip are what makes it so capable. Together, they allow Voice Preview Edition to have echo cancellation, stationary noise removal, and auto gain control, which all adds up to clearer audio. This combined with an ESP32-S3 with 8 MB of octal PSRAM - one of the fastest ESP and RAM combinations available - makes for an incredibly responsive device. This is the best Assist hardware you can buy today, and it will continue to give a great experience as Assist’s feature set expands in the years to come.</p>\n<h3>Bringing choice to voice</h3>\n<p>Assist can do something almost no other voice assistant can achieve - <em>it can run without the internet</em> 🤯. You can speak to your Voice Preview Edition, and those commands can be processed completely within the walls of your home. At the time of writing this, there are some pretty big caveats, specifically that you need to speak a <a href=\"/voice-pe/#language-support\">supported language</a> and have pretty powerful hardware to run it (we recommend a Home Assistant system running on an Intel N100 or better).</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/local-cloud.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"graphic of local vs cloud\">Diagram of cloud vs local speech processing</p>\n<p>If you use low-powered Home Assistant hardware, there is an easy and affordable internet-based solution; <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a>. This privacy-focused service allows you to offload your speech-to-text and text-to-speech processing, all while being very responsive and keeping your energy bill low. Speech-to-text is the harder of the two to run locally, and our cloud processing is almost always more accurate for more languages (visit our <a href=\"/voice-pe/#language-support\">language support checker here</a>).</p>\n<p>Our goal is for Assist to run easily, affordably, and fully locally for all languages. As someone who has seen the rapid development of this technology over the past several years, I’m optimistic that this will happen, but until then, many languages have a good range of choices that provide strong privacy.</p>\n<h3>Fully open and customizable</h3>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/3d-prints.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Some interesting cartoon-inspired 3D prints for Voice Preview Edition\">We are sharing the design files if you want to 3D print a new case... these ones were inevitable</p>\n<p>We’re not just launching a new product, <em><strong>we’re open sourcing all of it</strong></em>. We built this for the Home Assistant community. Our community doesn’t want a single voice assistant, they want the one that works for them – they want choice. Creating a voice assistant is hard, and until now, parts of the solution were locked behind expensive licenses and proprietary software. With Voice Preview Edition being open source, we hope to bootstrap an ecosystem of voice assistants.</p>\n<p>We tried to make every aspect of Voice Preview Edition customizable, which is actually pretty easy when you’re working hand-in-hand with ESPHome and Home Assistant. It works great with the stock settings, but if you’re so inclined, you can customize the Assist software, ESP32 firmware, and XMOS firmware.</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/grove.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Voice Preview Edition with packaging\">Connecting Grove sensors allows you to use your Voice Preview Edition as a more traditional ESPHome device - here is it acting as a voice assistant and air monitor.</p>\n<p>We also made the hardware easy to modify, inside and out. For instance, the included speaker is for alerts and voice prompts, but if you want to use it as a media player, connect a speaker to the included 3.5mm headphone jack and control it with software like <a href=\"https://music-assistant.io/\">Music Assistant</a>. The included DAC is very clean and capable of streaming lossless audio. It can also be used as a very capable ESP32 device. On the bottom of the device is a <a href=\"https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System/\">Grove port</a> (concealed under a cover that can be permanently removed), which allows you to connect a large ecosystem of sensors and accessories.</p>\n<p>We’ve also made it quite painless to open, with easy-to-access screws and no clips. We even included exposed pads on the circuit board to make modifying it more straightforward. We’re providing all the <a href=\"https://voice-pe.home-assistant.io/resources/\">3D files</a> so you can print your own components… even cartoon character-inspired ones. We’re not here to dictate what you can and can’t do with your device, and we tried our best to stay out of your way.</p>\n<h3>Community-driven</h3>\n<p>The beauty of Home Assistant and ESPHome is that you are never alone when fixing an issue or adding a feature. We made this device so the community could start working more closely together on voice; we even considered calling it the <em>Community</em> edition. Ultimately, it is the community driving forward voice - either by taking part in its development or supporting its development by buying official hardware or Home Assistant Cloud. So much has already been done for voice, and I can’t wait to see the advancements we make together.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Home Assistant <del>values</del> champions choice. Today, we’re providing one of the best choices for voice hardware. One that is truly private and totally open. I’m so proud of the team for building such a great working and feeling piece of hardware - this is a really big leap for voice hardware. I expect it to be the hardware benchmark for open-voice projects for years to come. I would also like to thank our language leaders who are expanding the reach of this project, our testers of this Preview Edition, and anyone who has joined in our voice work over the past years.</p>\n<p>The hardware really is only half the picture, and it’s the software that really brings this all together. Mike Hansen has just written the <a href=\"/blog/2024/12/19/voice-chapter-8-assist-in-the-home/\">Voice Chapter 8 blog</a> to accompany this launch, and this explains all the things we’ve built over the past two years to make Assist work in the home today. He also highlights everything that Voice Preview Edition was built to help accelerate development.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"/blog/2024/12/19/voice-chapter-8-assist-in-the-home/\">See what voice can do today</a></h3>\n",
