The brand new target picker. 🎯</p>\n<p>It’s one of those changes that seems simple on the surface, but makes such a huge difference in how you build automations. You can finally see exactly what you’re targeting, with full context about which device an entity belongs to and which area it’s in. No more guessing whether you’re controlling the right ceiling light when you have three of them!</p>\n<p>But that’s just the beginning. We’re continuing with the automation editor improvements, this time with a completely redesigned dialog for adding triggers, conditions, and actions. It’s cleaner, easier to read, and sets the foundation for some really exciting stuff coming in future releases. 🤫</p>\n<p>And speaking of making things clearer, you can now control exactly how entity names appear on your dashboard cards. Want to show just the entity name? The device name? The area? Or combine them? Even if you rename things, your dashboards will stay perfectly in sync. No more manual updates needed!</p>\n<p>Oh, and energy dashboard fans will appreciate the new pie chart view for device energy, complete with totals displayed in the corner of every energy card. 🥧</p>\n<p>Enjoy the release!</p>\n<p>../Frenck</p>\n<p>PS: Oh, and pssst… Don’t tell anyone 🤫, but there might be something exciting being released on November 19th. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSRvso6cbf0\">Hit the bell on this announced YouTube stream to not miss it</a>.

Or tried to figure out how many lights you’re actually controlling when you target an entire floor or area?</p>\n<p>We’ve all been there. Until now, the target picker didn’t show you the full picture. You couldn’t see which device an entity belonged to or which area it was assigned to. And when you selected a floor or area as your target, you had no idea how many entities you were actually affecting. This uncertainty meant many of you stuck with targeting individual entities, even though larger targets (like areas and floors) can make your automations much more flexible.</p>\n<p>The new target picker changes all that. Now you get full context for everything you’re targeting, and you can see exactly how many entities will be affected by your action.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of a light action configuration with targets picked.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-11/target-picker.png\" />\n<p>Want to dig deeper? You can expand any floor, area, or device to see exactly which entities are included and where they’re coming from.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of the details of a target.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-11/target-details.png\" />\n<p>This makes it so much easier to build automations that scale with your home. When you target an area or floor, your automation automatically adapts as you add or remove devices. No more updating your automations every time you add a new light or sensor. Your automations just work, which is exactly how it should be.</p>\n<h2>A brand new way to add triggers, conditions, and actions in your automations</h2>\n<p>It’s no secret that we’re currently working hard on making automations easier to create. After the release of the automation sidebar <a href=\"/blog/2025/09/03/release-20259/#automation-editor-sidebar\">two releases ago</a>, we are now introducing a new dialog to add triggers, conditions, and actions.</p>\n<p>The changes are purely cosmetic: the dialog is bigger, so the description of each block is simpler to read, with a two-pane layout to ease both navigation and block selection.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of the new dialog to add an action.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-11/add-automation-dialog.png\" />\n<p>The building blocks (which are used to perform more complex conditions or sequences of actions, such as repeating actions or branching out your sequence into multiple paths) have been moved into the main dialog on a second tab. There is now a single entry point to add something to an automation instead of two, greatly reducing the number of buttons in complex automations.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of the new dialog to add a building block to an action.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-11/add-automation-dialog-blocks.png\" />\n<p>As mentioned above, these changes are purely cosmetic, for now! But this new dialog is the foundation of what’s coming next, and we cannot wait to present that to you once it finally lands.</p>\n<h2>Naming entities on your dashboard</h2>\n<p>A few releases ago, we gave the entity picker a big upgrade by adding more context so you could easily see where each entity belongs (<a href=\"/blog/2025/05/07/release-20255/#picking-entities\">May 2025 release</a>). In this release, we’re bringing that same flexibility to your dashboards.</p>\n<p>You can now choose how names appear on your cards: show the entity, device, area, floor, or even combine them. This gives you full control over how your dashboards look and feel. For example, in a dedicated section for a specific device, you might choose to display only the entity name to avoid repeating the device name on every card.</p>\n<p>Of course, you can still set a custom name if you want complete control over the text shown.</p>\n<p>And the best part? If you rename an entity or device, your dashboards will automatically stay in sync. No more manual edits needed; everything just updates itself.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of the configuration dialog of a tile card.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-11/card-naming.png\" />\n<h2>Energy pie</h2>\n<p>We’ve added a new layout to the devices energy graph: “pie” 🥧. You can toggle between the regular bar chart and the new pie chart by clicking the icon in the top-right corner.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the devices energy graph in pie layout.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-11/pie-chart.png\" />\n<p>Doing this made the top-right corner of the other energy cards feel empty, so we used that space to display the total energy for the selected period. For example, if the date picker is set to today, the total solar energy for today will be displayed in the corner of the solar production graph card.</p>\n<h2>Progress for Home Assistant and Add-on updates</h2>\n<p>With this release, you can now track the progress of updates to Home Assistant and Add-ons (managed by the Supervisor)! The progress includes the stages of downloading and unpacking, so the time required will vary based on your internet speed, CPU performance, and system load. As a result, the progress is not reflected as perfectly linear, but it does still provide a good estimate of how far along the update is.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screen recording showing an add-on update with progress reporting.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-11/supervisor-progress-report.gif\" />\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> and improvements to existing ones!

The integration has not been working since the API v1 that it used was taken offline in September 2023.</li>\n<li><strong>IBM Watson IoT Platform</strong> has been removed. On September 8, 2020, IBM announced the withdrawal of its support for the IBM Watson IoT Platform and successively discontinued all versions until September 30, 2022.</li>\n<li><strong>Plum Lightpad</strong> has been removed. Their servers have been shut down, which made the integration non-functional.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>\n<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other noteworthy changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/thecode\">@thecode</a> added <a href=\"/integrations/group\">group</a> support for valves, so you can group multiple valves into one.</li>\n<li>Searching in data tables got a lot better; you can now search over multiple columns at once.

We’ve made our logging system way more efficient. 🚀</p>\n<p>You might not realize it, but all those Home Assistant logs you can find in <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Logs</strong> were actually being stored on your disk twice. 🙈</p>\n<p>Home Assistant OS keeps all logs for everything, including Home Assistant itself, in a very efficient way, even across restarts! But on top of that, we were also writing them to a log file in your Home Assistant configuration folder.</p>\n<p>That’s not ideal. It takes twice the disk space, but more importantly, it causes unnecessary wear on your storage medium, which means it will fail sooner. This is especially concerning if you’re using an SD card in, for example, a Raspberry Pi.</p>\n<p>As of this release, we’ve stopped writing logs to the configuration folder. You can still view and download all logs from the Home Assistant settings page, just like before. We’ve adapted that page to read the logs from the OS directly instead.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-tip\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:lightbulb-outline'></iconify-icon> Tip</p>\n  <div class=\"alert-content\">\n<p>Are you more into the command line? No worries, our Home Assistant CLI has you covered. Check it out by running <code>ha core logs --help</code> for more information.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>The new Home Dashboard keeps getting smarter</h3>\n<p>Following the improvements introduced in the latest releases, this release makes the experience even smoother and more intuitive.</p>\n<p>We’ve simplified and reorganized things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suggested entities and favorites are now combined into a single, smart section, showing you what’s most relevant in one place.</li>\n<li>Areas are now grouped by floor, making it easier to browse and understand your home’s layout at a glance.</li>\n<li>The Lights, Climate, and Security views have been moved to their own dedicated dashboards, so you can access them directly under <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Dashboards</strong>. These dashboards now also include devices that aren’t assigned to any specific area, ensuring nothing is overlooked.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These improvements bring everything together more naturally, helping your Home Dashboard feel less like a setup and more like a true reflection of your home.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"New built-in dashboards in dashboards config panel\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-11/config-dashboards.png\" />\n<h2>Patch releases</h2>\n<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.11 in November.\nThese patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch\nrelease once a week, aiming for Friday.</p>\n<h3>2025.11.1 - November 7</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve scan interval for Airthings Corentium Home 2 (<a href=\"https://github.com/LaStrada\">@LaStrada</a> -

ELTAKO’s robust relay switches have formed the blueprint for smart building and smart home control across Europe for decades – <em>and</em> happen to be the first Matter relays to join the program.</p>\n<p>You may never have seen one of ELTAKO’s little blue devices before, and that’s the point. They usually sit quietly behind walls, furniture and in distribution boards, doing their jobs without interfering with interiors. Now, thanks to their joining the Works with Home Assistant program, you can bring these professional-level installations to your own smart set-up.<!--more--></p>\n<h2>Out of the blue and into the open home</h2>\n<p>ELTAKO has been a well-known name in the German building trade and throughout Europe for more than 75 years. In fact, the name itself derives from ‘<strong>EL</strong>ektrischer <strong>TA</strong>st-<strong>KO</strong>ntakt’ (electrical push-button contact) in a nod to ELTAKO’s first impulse switch innovation that started it all back in 1949.</p>\n<p>For those of us who haven’t been around quite that long, an impulse switch (also known as a latching or step relay) toggles a circuit on or off each time it receives an electrical pulse. Instead of requiring constant power, it ‘remembers’ its state until the next signal. As well as using less energy, this means it’s possible to control a single light or system from multiple switches without complex wiring – with obvious advantages for the smart home. So synonymous is the brand with this type of device that impulse switches are still referred to as ‘ELTAKOS’ by the professional electricians and engineers who use them.</p>\n<p>Because of this innovative spirit, it’s perhaps no surprise that over the years ELTAKO has broadened its range to a full ecosystem of sensors, dimmers, and energy meters – all based on wired or wireless technologies, such as RS485, EnOcean, Modbus or DALI, which are built for longevity and local control, rather than cloud dependency.</p>\n<p>True to that philosophy, ELTAKO has embraced open standards such as Matter, ensuring its products speak the same languages that support our mission to keep homes open, private, and locally controlled.</p>\n<div class=\"alert\">\n<p>\"As a manufacturer that has relied on open standards like Matter and EnOcean from the very beginning, joining the Works with Home Assistant program is a natural step for us. This allows us to make our products accessible to an even larger community and enables our customers to integrate them seamlessly into diverse smart home environments. We are convinced that the future lies in openness and interoperability – which is why we deliberately embrace partnerships that offer users long-term investment security and maximum flexibility.\"</p>\n<em style=\"text-align: right; display: block;\">- Kai Sepp, Sales Director North & West Europe at ELTAKO</em>\n</div>\n<h2>Devices</h2>\n<p>ELTAKO’s <a href=\"/integrations/eltako/\">integration</a> with Home Assistant starts with items from the 64 series, which was awarded the SmartHome Germany Award this year. This is the brand’s line that uses Matter over Wi-Fi, showing just how serious they are about interoperability moving forward.</p>\n<p>We were also lucky enough to see the ELTAKO team at ISE Barcelona this year, and we’ll be catching up with them again at the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) meeting in November, also in Barca. Since CSA certification is a must for brands joining the program, it’s great to see ELTAKO so engaged.</p>\n<p>As always, all the devices below have gone through our rigorous certification process to ensure they meet our standards for performance, reliability and open-home compatibility.</p>\n<p>What devices have been certified?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.eltako.com/en/catalog/products/1761/eud64npn-ipm\">ELTAKO Universal Dimming Actuator EUD64NPN-IPM</a> (and the previous version <a href=\"https://www.eltako.com/en/catalog/products/1238/eud62npn-ipm110-240v/\">here</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.eltako.com/en/catalog/products/1760/esr64pf-ipm/\">ELTAKO Impulse Switch ESR64PF-IPM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.eltako.com/en/catalog/products/1759/esr64np-ipm\">ELTAKO Impulse Switch ESR64NP-IPM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.eltako.com/en/catalog/products/1792/esb64np-ipm/\">ELTAKO Shading Actuator ESB64NP-IPM</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These Matter devices that work over Wi-Fi are all about giving you freedom to control your current hardware – switch lights on and off and dim them automatically – without replacing it all. The shading actuator is particularly useful in continental Europe, where shutters are more common. It has a good energy-saving use case to reduce the need for air conditioning, since automatic shutters help keep your home cool in summer and warm in winter, potentially reducing utility bills. This also reflects ELTAKO’s wider focus on sustainability – from low-power devices to recyclable packaging and shipping materials.</p>\n<p>In case you didn’t know, when using Matter devices with Home Assistant you have local control with no need for external internet for day-to-day operation. If you do want to access your dashboard while you’re away from home, using <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> is a simple, secure, way to do this (and help fund Home Assistant’s development in the process!).</p>\n<h2>Professional quality, support for all</h2>\n<p>Like all brands within the Works with Home Assistant program, ELTAKO isn’t just adding our little blue logo to their little blue products – they’re joining our community. That means active engagement and shared expertise to help everyone get the best from their devices. Because ELTAKO’s products are built to professional standards, installation can sometimes require a qualified electrician – especially for wired set-ups. That’s where ELTAKO’s directory of system partners and specialists in many regions, as well as a tech support hotline, can help you find the installation advice you need, whether you’re a complete novice or electrical enthusiast.</p>\n<p>With ELTAKO on board, we hope Home Assistant users will have further flexibility to explore new devices and experiment with different set-ups, as well as open up more ways to mix and match products to build a professional-standard smart home.</p>\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: If I have a device that is not listed under ‘Works with Home Assistant’ does this mean it’s not supported?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No! It just means that it hasn’t gone through a testing schedule with our team or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program. It might function perfectly well but be added to the testing schedule later down the road, or it might work under a different connectivity type that we don’t currently test under the program.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: OK, so what’s the point of the Works with program?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that the devices must have key functionality within Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud, and will continue to do so long-term.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How were these devices tested?</strong></p>\n<p>A: All devices in this list were tested using a standard HA Green Hub and with our <a href=\"/integrations/matter/\">certified Matter Integration</a>. If you have another set-up that’s not a problem, but we test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will you be adding more ELTAKO devices to the program?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Why not! We’re thrilled to foster a close relationship with the team at ELTAKO to work together on any upcoming releases, or add in further products that are not yet listed here. We’re really excited about what ELTAKO are doing with EnOcean and green power generally, but we haven’t tested or certified any of these products yet. We don’t have this protocol as part of the Works with Home Assistant certification (even if people are already using <a href=\"/integrations/enocean/\">EnOcean in Home Assistant</a>), and could explore how we certify these kinds of products.</p>\n",

In this chapter, we will tell you how our assistant can now control more things in the home, in multiple languages at the same time, all while not talking your ear off. What’s more, our list of supported languages has grown again with several languages that big tech’s voice assistants won’t support. Join us for a deeper look at this voice chapter in our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIkguv0NEQI\">livestream</a> on Wednesday, October 29. It’s been a couple of months, we’ve been building up our voice, and now have a lot to say, so let’s get to it!<!--more--></p>\n<h2>Multilingual assistants</h2>\n<p>Our original goal for the <a href=\"/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/\">Year of Voice back in 2023</a> was to “let users control Home Assistant in their own language”. We’ve come a long way towards that goal, and really broadened our language support. We’ve also provided options that allow users to customize voice assistant pipelines with the services that best support their language, whether run locally or in the cloud of their choice. But what if you speak two languages within your home?</p>\n<p>For some time, users have been able to create <a href=\"/voice_control/\">Assist</a> voice assistant pipelines for different languages in Home Assistant, but interacting with the different pipelines has either required multiple voice satellite devices (one per language) or some kind of automation <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/ZgoaoTpIhm8?t=3902\">trigger to switch languages</a>.</p>\n<p>Since even the tiniest voice satellite hardware we support is capable of running <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/26/voice-chapter-7/#3x-wake-words-and-2x-accuracy\">multiple wake words</a> now, we’ve added support in 2025.10 for configuring <strong>up to two wake words</strong> and voice assistant pipelines on each Assist satellite! This makes it straightforward to support dual language households by assigning different wake words to different languages. For example, “Okay Nabu” could run an English voice assistant pipeline while “Hey Jarvis” is used for French.</p>\n<p>Multiple wake words and pipelines can be used for other purposes as well. Want to keep your local and cloud-based voice assistants separate? Easy! Assign a wake word like “Okay Nabu” to a fully local pipeline using our own <a href=\"/blog/2025/02/13/voice-chapter-9-speech-to-phrase/\">Speech-to-Phrase</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/blob/master/piper/DOCS.md\">Piper</a>. This pipeline would be limited to basic voice commands, but would not require anything to run outside of your Home Assistant server. Alongside this, “Hey Jarvis” could be assigned to a different pipeline that uses external services like Home Assistant Cloud and an LLM to answer questions or perform complex actions.</p>\n<p>We’d love to hear feedback on how you plan to use multiple wake words and voice assistants in your home!</p>\n<h2>Voice without AI</h2>\n<p>The whole world is engulfed in hype about AI and adding it to all the things — <a href=\"/blog/2025/09/11/ai-in-home-assistant/\">we’re not exactly quiet about the cool stuff we’re doing with AI.</a> While powering your voice assistants with AI/LLMs makes them much more flexible and powerful, it comes at a cost: paying to use cloud-based services like OpenAI and Google, or pricey hardware and energy to run local models via systems like Ollama. We started building our voice assistant before AI was a thing, and thus it was designed without requiring it. We continue to make great progress towards delivering a solid voice experience to users who want to keep their home AI free — keeping <a href=\"https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/ai-is-optional-privacy-isnt/\">AI opt-in only and not required</a> are guidelines we follow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/voice_control/\">Assist</a>, our built-in voice assistant, can do a lot of cool things without the need for AI! This includes <a href=\"/voice_control/builtin_sentences/\">a ton of voice commands in dozens of languages</a> for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turning lights and other devices on/off</li>\n<li>Opening/closing and locking/unlocking doors, windows, shades, etc</li>\n<li>Adjusting the brightness and color of lights</li>\n<li>Running scripts and activating scenes</li>\n<li>Controlling media players and adjusting their volume</li>\n<li>Playing music on supported media players via <a href=\"/integrations/music_assistant/\">Music Assistant</a></li>\n<li>Starting/stopping/pausing multiple timers, optionally with names</li>\n<li>Adding/completing items on to-do lists</li>\n<li>Delaying a command for later (“turn off lights in 5 minutes”)…</li>\n<li>…and more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Want to include your own voice commands? You can quickly add <a href=\"/voice_control/custom_sentences/\">custom sentences</a> to an automation, allowing you to take any action and tailor the response.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to get started is with <a href=\"/voice-pe/\">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a>, our small and easy-to-start with Voice Assistant hardware. This, combined with a <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud subscription</a>, allows any Home Assistant system to quickly handle voice commands, as our privacy-focused cloud processes the speech-to-text (turning your voice into text for Home Assistant) and text-to-speech (turning Home Assistant’s response back into voice). This is all without the use of LLMs, and supports the development of Home Assistant 😎.</p>\n<p>For users wanting to keep all voice processing local, we offer add-ons for both speech-to-text and text-to-speech:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/blob/master/whisper/DOCS.md\">Whisper</a> is a powerful speech-to-text system that comes in <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages\">different sizes with varying hardware requirements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/2025/02/13/voice-chapter-9-speech-to-phrase/\">Speech-to-Phrase</a> is our speech-to-text system that trades flexibility for speed</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/blob/master/piper/DOCS.md\">Piper</a> is our fast neural text-to-speech system with <a href=\"https://rhasspy.github.io/piper-samples/\">broad language support</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this together shows just how much can be done without needing to include AI, even though it can do <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mLtFUG4YG1A\">some pretty amazing things</a>. And we’re continuing to close the gap with the features highlighted in this blog post, including multilingual assistants, improved sentence matching, and the ability to ask questions from automations.</p>\n<h3>More intents</h3>\n<p>Intents are what connect a voice command to the right actions in Home Assistant to get something done. While the end result is often simple, such as turning on a light, intents are designed as a “do what I mean” layer above the level of basic actions. In the previous section, we listed the sorts of voice commands that intents enable, from turning on lights to adding items to your to-do list. Over the last three years, we’ve been progressively adding new and more complex intents.</p>\n<p>Recently, we’ve added three new intents to make Assist even better. To control media players, you can now set the <strong>relative</strong> volume with voice commands like “turn up the volume” or “decrease TV volume by 25%”. This adds to the existing volume intent, which allows you to set the absolute volume level like “set TV volume to 50%”.</p>\n<p>Next, it’s now possible to set the speed of a fan by percentage. For example, “set desk fan speed to 50%” or even “set fans to 50%” to target all fans in the current area. Make sure you <a href=\"/voice_control/voice_remote_expose_devices/\">expose</a> the fans you want Assist to be able to control.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you can now tell the kids to “get off your lawn” because your robot is going to mow it! Making use of the <a href=\"/integrations/lawn_mower\">lawn_mower</a> integration, your voice assistant can now understand commands like “mow the lawn” and “stop the mower”. Paired with the existing smart vacuum commands, you may never need to lift a finger again to keep things clean and tidy.</p>\n<h3>Ask question</h3>\n<p><em>Picture this:</em> you come home from work and, as you enter the living room, your voice assistant asks what type of music you’d like to hear while preparing dinner. As the music starts to play, it mentions you left the garage door open and wants to know if you’d like it closed. After dinner, as you’re hanging out on the couch, your voice assistant informs you that the temperature outside is lower than your AC setting and asks for confirmation to turn it off and open the windows.</p>\n<p><em>Surely you’d need a powerful LLM to perform such wizardry, right?</em> With the <a href=\"/integrations/assist_satellite/#action-assist_satelliteask_question\">Ask Question action</a>, this can all be done locally using Assist and a few automations!</p>\n<div class=\"contain\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2025-10-voice-chapter-11/automation.webp\" alt=\"Ask Question LLM in action\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:unset;\">\n</div>\n<p>Within an automation, the <a href=\"/blog/2025/07/02/release-20257/#let-assist-ask-the-questions\">Ask Question</a> action allows you to announce a message on a voice satellite, match the response against a list of possible answers, and take an action depending on the user’s answer. While answers can be open-ended, such as a musical artist or genre, limiting the possible answers allows you to use the fully local <a href=\"/blog/2025/02/13/voice-chapter-9-speech-to-phrase/\">Speech-to-Phrase</a> for recognizing speech without an internet connection.</p>\n<h2>Improved sentence matching</h2>\n<p>Assist was designed to run fast and fully offline on hardware like the Raspberry Pi 4 for many different languages. It works by matching the text of your voice commands against sentence templates, such as “turn on the {name}” or “turn off lights in the {area}”. While this is very fast and straightforward to <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/intents/\">translate to many languages</a>, it can also be inflexible, resulting in the dreaded “Sorry, I couldn’t understand that” or other errors.</p>\n<div class=\"contain\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2025-10-voice-chapter-11/sentence-matching.webp\" alt=\"Conversation with sentence matching\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:420px;\">\n</div>\n<p>Starting in <a href=\"/blog/2025/09/03/release-20259/\">Home Assistant 2025.9</a>, we’ve included an improved “fuzzy matcher” that is much better at handling extra words or alternative phrasings of our supported voice commands.</p>\n<div class=\"contain\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2025-10-voice-chapter-11/fuzzy-matching.webp\" alt=\"Conversation with fuzzy matcher\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:420px;\">\n</div>\n<p>The fuzzy matcher is pre-trained on the existing sentence templates, so we will be able to use it for all of our supported languages. However, this is initially only available for the English language and we’re working to determine the best way to enable this for other languages.</p>\n<h2>Non-verbal confirmations</h2>\n<p>After a voice command, Assist responds with a short confirmation like “Turned on the lights” or “Brightness set”. This lets you know it understood your command and took the appropriate actions. However, if you’re in the same room as the voice assistant, this confirmation is redundant; you can see or hear that appropriate actions were taken.</p>\n<p>Starting with <a href=\"/blog/2025/10/01/release-202510/\">Home Assistant 2025.10</a>, Assist will detect if the voice command’s actions all took place within the same area as the satellite device. If so, a short confirmation “beep” will be played instead of the full verbal response. Besides being less verbose, this also serves as a reminder that your voice command only affected the current area.</p>\n<p>Non-verbal confirmations will not be used in voice assistant pipelines with LLMs, since the user may have specific instructions in their prompt, such as “respond like a pirate”, and we wouldn’t want to deprive you of a fun response, me mateys 🏴‍☠️.</p>\n<h2>Text-to-speech streaming</h2>\n<p>Large language models (LLMs) can be especially verbose in their responses, and we quickly realized that this exposed a weakness in Home Assistant’s text-to-speech (TTS)  implementation. For most of its life, TTS in Home Assistant has required the full response to be generated before any audio can be played. This meant a lot of waiting for multi-paragraph LLM responses, especially with local TTS systems like Piper.</p>\n<p>Fixing this required an overhaul of the TTS architecture to allow for <strong>streaming</strong>. Instead of waiting for the entire audio message to be synthesized before playing, we enabled TTS services within Home Assistant to work with chunks of text (input) and audio (output). As chunks of text are streamed in from an LLM, the TTS service can synthesize audio chunks and send them out to be played immediately.</p>\n<p>To demonstrate the benefit of streaming, we asked an LLM to “<a href=\"/blog/2025/09/11/ai-in-home-assistant/#:~:text=Prompt%3A%20%E2%80%9CTell%20me%20a%20long%20story%20about%20a%20frog%E2%80%9D\">tell me a long story about a frog</a>” and timed how long it took to start speaking the (multi-paragraph) response. Without streaming, both Home Assistant Cloud and Piper took more than five seconds to respond! This is long enough to make you wonder if your voice assistant heard you 😄 With streaming enabled, both TTS services took about half a second to start talking back. A 10x improvement in latency!</p>\n<h2>New Piper voices</h2>\n<p>Piper, our homegrown text-to-speech tool, continues to grow with support for several new languages! These new voices were trained from publicly available voice datasets, and are available now in the <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=core_piper\">Piper add-on</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daniela (Argentinian Spanish)</li>\n<li>Pratham, Priyamvada, Rohan (Hindi)</li>\n<li>News TTS (Indonesian)</li>\n<li>Maya, Padmavathi, Venkatesh (Telugu)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Want to know what the new voices sound like? You can <a href=\"https://rhasspy.github.io/piper-samples/\">listen to samples</a> of every available Piper voice or even <a href=\"https://rhasspy.github.io/piper-samples/demo.html\">run Piper entirely within your web browser</a> for free.</p>\n<p>If your language is missing from Piper, or you don’t like the existing voices for your language, we’re always looking for volunteers to contribute their voices! Please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:voice@openhomefoundation.org\">voice@openhomefoundation.org</a></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In the past three years, we’ve made great strides with Home Assistant Voice on both the hardware and software fronts. Users today have a wide variety of choices when it comes to voice: from fully local to using the latest and greatest AI to power their smart homes. The great thing about our experimentation with AI is that there are no investors looking for returns, fake money, or “rug-pulls”. We do everything for you, our community. We’re in this for the long haul, and want this all to be your choice, keeping you in full control of whether you want to use this technology or avoid the hype completely.</p>\n<p>Much of the advanced work done on voice is only possible with the support of our community, especially those who subscribe to <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> or anyone who has purchased our <a href=\"/voice-pe/\">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a> (both great ways to get started with voice).</p>\n",

Rest assured, it will continue to receive software support far into the future.<!--more--></p>\n<p>I’m Carl, Vice President of Commercial at Nabu Casa, the organization that builds and sells official hardware for the Open Home Foundation. I couldn’t be more proud of our hardware achievements over the past 12 months, including <a href=\"/voice-pe/\">Voice Preview Edition</a> and <a href=\"/connect/zwa-2/\">Connect ZWA-2</a> (including its cool new <a href=\"/blog/2025/10/13/portable-z-wave-with-wifi-and-poe/\">Wi-Fi and PoE experimental firmware</a>).</p>\n<p>Home Assistant Yellow was similarly groundbreaking at launch and helped fund Home Assistant’s development. However, for reasons I’ll explain below, the time has come to end production. This means that if you were considering buying a Home Assistant Yellow, you’ll need to act fast, as stock will not be replenished (check the <em>Order Now</em> button on the <a href=\"/yellow\">Home Assistant Yellow page</a> to see if your local retailer still has stock).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/\">Nabu Casa</a> is now exploring what hardware could replace Home Assistant Yellow, so if you have any suggestions on what we should do next, <strong>please</strong> <strong>tell us in the comments!</strong> In the meantime, the good news is that there are already <a href=\"/installation/\">plenty of other great ways to run Home Assistant</a>. For example, if you’re looking for hardware that’s both easy to start with and supports the Open Home Foundation, we’d recommend the <a href=\"/green\">Home Assistant Green</a>.</p>\n<h2>A golden era</h2>\n<p>There is a long yellow brick road that brought us to today. All the way <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPR-shzT_VQ\">back in 2021</a>, we announced Home Assistant Yellow (originally called Amber). It included some pretty unique features, including its built-in Zigbee or Thread adapter, optional PoE, and overall expandable approach. As it used the Raspberry Pi Compute Module platform, included GPIO, and had an NVMe slot, there were a lot of different ways you could upgrade it over time (including people <a href=\"/blog/2024/11/27/home-assistant-yellow-gets-cm5-support/\">being able to upgrade from CM4 to CM5</a>, which was quite the <a href=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/home-assistant-yellow-instant-2x-iot-speedup-cm5\">speed bump</a> 🏎️).</p>\n<p>It wasn’t all smooth sailing with Home Assistant Yellow. We essentially launched the device in the middle of the great Pi shortage. It definitely complicated things for a time, but it all eventually stabilized. In late 2023, we launched <a href=\"/green\">Home Assistant Green</a>, which became the easiest way to get started with Home Assistant. This new product led us to <a href=\"/blog/2024/08/01/streamlining-the-home-assistant-yellow-lineup/\">end the sale</a> of Home Assistant Yellow devices that shipped with a CM4 already installed (called the <em>Home Assistant Yellow Standard</em>), which allowed us to focus the product line on the kit versions.</p>\n<p class=\"img\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2025-10-yellow-eol/yellow.webp\" alt=\"Exploded view of the Home Assistant Yellow\">\n    Small, but so much room for activities\n</p>\n<p>Home Assistant Green continues to have strong sales, but Home Assistant Yellow sales have been naturally slowing down, as happens a couple of years into any product’s life. This month, it finally reached the point where it no longer made sense to have another production run, which ultimately pushed us to discontinue Home Assistant Yellow.</p>\n<p>Technology changes, and small-form-factor computing has always moved fast. For instance, in the early days of Home Assistant, the community’s de facto recommendation was always the most recent Raspberry Pi device, but we’re seeing more people gravitate towards Mini PCs. We’re now exploring what we could build next for our power users, but we’re still some way off, so don’t wait if you need something today.</p>\n<h2>Software support continues</h2>\n<p>As long as it’s possible to run Home Assistant on Yellow, we will continue to provide builds. If you want living proof of this commitment, take our first hardware device: Home Assistant Blue. It ended production in 2022, but still receives new builds of Home Assistant, something that shows no signs of changing for a long time. We continue to streamline and make Home Assistant more efficient, as it’s our goal for you to run it on the hardware you have.</p>\n<h2>Say ‘ellow to the future</h2>\n<p>I’d just like to take a moment to thank everyone who bought a Home Assistant Yellow over the years, and for all the great feedback you shared with us. We’re sad to say goodbye to our trusty little expandable powerhouse, but it’s had a good run and we’re super proud of how far we’ve come. Also, we’ll soon be announcing the date of our next hardware product (not a computing device… but something very cool nonetheless), so stay tuned!</p>\n",

Today, we’re announcing a new, experimental firmware that allows you to do even more with the ultimate Z-Wave adapter.</p>\n<p>I’m <a href=\"https://github.com/kbx81\">Keith</a>, a Senior Hardware and Software Engineer at <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/\">Nabu Casa</a>, but you also might know me from my work on the ESPHome project. If you weren’t aware, Nabu Casa is the commercial partner of the Open Home Foundation, and the organization that helps build official Home Assistant hardware.</p>\n<p>During the launch, one piece of feedback we often received was that people wanted more flexibility in where they could place Connect ZWA-2 in their home — often far away from their Home Assistant system. It was no easy feat (more on that below), but we were able to build a solution that allows you to put it anywhere you have a network connection.</p>\n<p>This experimental firmware will allow you to not only leverage the Wi-Fi chip inside the Connect ZWA-2, but also use it with other hardware to facilitate the use of the much-requested PoE. 🎉 This new firmware is only possible because of the second-generation platform we built Connect ZWA-2 on, which is open by design, allowing you to tinker and extend the device you own. Every piece of Home Assistant hardware reflects Nabu Casa and the foundation’s philosophy of constant evolution, and the software it launches with is just the beginning. Whenever we think of a cool new capability, we will work together to add it.</p>\n<p>If you want to <a href=\"https://toolbox.openhomefoundation.org/home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/\">start using your Connect ZWA-2 with Portable Z-Wave today</a>, visit the <a href=\"https://toolbox.openhomefoundation.org/\">brand new home for all the foundation’s web-based tools</a>.

Do not use it if you’re looking for the most stable Z-Wave experience.\n</div>\n<p>To get started using your Connect ZWA-2 over your local network, you can use one of the two following configurations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wi-Fi</strong> - the new firmware will be installed on the Connect ZWA-2 and use its built-in Wi-Fi chip to communicate over your network.</li>\n<li><strong>PoE</strong> - the new firmware will be installed on an <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4h2T2q7\">external development board</a> that supports Power-over-Ethernet (PoE); Connect ZWA-2 will use its stock firmware and will plug into this new device via USB.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>First, before installing this new firmware, make sure to <a href=\"/integrations/zwave_js/#backing-up-your-z-wave-network\">back up your Z-Wave network</a> and ensure your Home Assistant instance is running version 2025.10.2 or later. Only after those steps should you use the <a href=\"https://toolbox.openhomefoundation.org/home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/\">toolkit website for Portable Z-Wave</a>. The toolkit’s wizard will walk you through the whole process of installing and connecting your device to your network. When the installation is complete, it should join your network and be discovered by both the ESPHome and Z-Wave integrations in Home Assistant.</p>\n<p>This firmware has proven to work well in our lab and home environments, but the real world is a different place; your local network and Z-Wave network might behave differently. For this reason, we’re seeking your feedback. If you try it out, please let us know about your experience – good or bad, brief or long-winded – by leaving a comment below. We’re eager to know how and where we can improve it!</p>\n<h2>The Portable Z-Wave experiment</h2>\n<p>Before we launch any of our hardware products, we try to get our pre-production batch to as many testers as possible – most are hobbyists and tinkerers from the community, and of course, the first thing they tend to do is get out the screwdriver and open it up (to be fair, it’s designed to be easy to open — no glue, no clips). When looking at the insides of Connect ZWA-2, they were instantly greeted with an ESP32 chip, and were equally excited and confused. It was initially included just as a USB controller, and yes, an ESP32-S3 is a bit overkill for this specific task, but we wanted to give the device room to grow. This brings us to the experiment we are sharing with you today…</p>\n<h3>Making things mesh</h3>\n<p>When you use a Z-Wave adapter with Home Assistant, which relies on the Z-Wave JS add-on, they use USB to communicate via a specialized Z-Wave serial protocol. And yes, it is technically possible to run this Z-Wave serial protocol over your network (serial-over-IP), but our testing reveals that it’s not as reliable or as easy as we’d like. Some parts of the Z-Wave serial protocol are latency (delay) sensitive, specifically the acknowledgment of Z-Wave packets. If your network is busy and decides to take its sweet time with one of those critical packets, your Z-Wave device’s connection can time out and fail. This can stall Z-Wave device communication, or even completely break it.</p>\n<p>For Z-Wave to work over a network, we need to address the latency-sensitive parts on the actual device; everything else can be forwarded over the network. This is where <a href=\"https://esphome.io/\">ESPHome</a> steps in: it’s the open source software for network-capable microcontrollers that runs on ESP32 devices. We built an ESP32 into the Connect ZWA-2, and it has the horsepower (and Wi-Fi antenna) to handle this task.</p>\n<p>To help make this all possible, we added <a href=\"https://next.esphome.io/components/zwave_proxy/\">Z-Wave support to ESPHome</a>, allowing it to talk to Z-Wave chips. We then added the ability for Home Assistant and Z-Wave JS to communicate with Z-Wave adapters via ESPHome. As this work is open source, it shouldn’t be limited just to our Connect ZWA-2. Theoretically, it should be able to work with any certified Z-Wave adapter connected to an ESP32. However, before we look at supporting other adapters, we want to ensure that it’s stable when running on the Connect ZWA-2.</p>\n<p class=\"img\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2025-10-z-wave-portable/with-wifi.png\" alt=\"Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 using the built-in Wi-Fi chip\">\n    Home Assistant connected to the ZWA-2 via its integrated Wi-Fi chip.\n</p>\n<p class=\"img\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2025-10-z-wave-portable/with-poe.png\" alt=\"Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 using POE via an adapter\">\n    Home Assistant connected to the ZWA-2 via the PoE module.\n</p>\n<p>ESPHome handles serial message acknowledgments internally, then leverages its API (specifically its <a href=\"https://developers.esphome.io/architecture/api/\">Protobuf implementation</a>) to send the messages over the network more reliably than serial-over-IP. Even if your home network is bogged down by some spikes in traffic, ESPHome will have you covered, keeping your Z-Wave network stable. That’s not to say this has no impact on performance, but it may be less than you think – or can even notice!</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<p>Wi-Fi is very convenient, but the million-dollar question is: <strong>how will it impact your Z-Wave network?</strong> To find out, we ran some benchmarks to see how Portable Z-Wave stacks up to its USB counterpart.</p>\n<p>Compared to a direct serial (USB) connection, a data packet <em>will</em> take longer to travel between Home Assistant/Z-Wave JS and your Z-Wave network when routed through your local network. On a network with only a low to moderate workload, the additional delay is very small and is generally not noticeable. That said, if your network is heavily stressed or the Wi-Fi signal is poor, you should expect packets to take longer to move around, which can lead to a perceivable delay. It can still control your lights and other devices, but it may be a bit slower. Here are some numbers illustrating the typical latency that we were able to achieve across our test environments:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Connection type</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Min (ms)</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Max (ms)</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Mean (ms)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">USB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">4</td>\n<td align=\"left\">9</td>\n<td align=\"left\">5.36</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Ethernet</td>\n<td align=\"left\">15</td>\n<td align=\"left\">32</td>\n<td align=\"left\">25.14</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Wi-Fi</td>\n<td align=\"left\">15</td>\n<td align=\"left\">92</td>\n<td align=\"left\">29.16</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Your results will likely differ somewhat, especially in less ideal conditions and environments. For instance, if you place your Connect ZWA-2 in a spot with really poor Wi-Fi connectivity, you might notice devices not reflecting their actual state or other buggy behavior. Avoid using VPNs or other complex network routing or configuration, as that will add latency. Also, don’t worry about Wi-Fi interfering with your Z-Wave network, as they operate on totally different radio frequencies that don’t interact. I think with a healthy dose of common sense, you can find a great spot that gets both great Wi-Fi connectivity <a href=\"https://support.nabucasa.com/hc/en-us/articles/28670284336925-Finding-an-installation-location-for-the-Home-Assistant-Connect-ZWA-2\">while nicely optimizing your Z-Wave network</a>.</p>\n<h2>Thanks</h2>\n<p>This project was brought to you by a collaboration between Nabu Casa and the people below from the Open Home Foundation.

The code is <a href=\"https://next.esphome.io/components/zwave_proxy/\">part of ESPHome 2025.10</a>, Home Assistant 2025.10.2, and Z-Wave JS v15.15.0. We chose Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 as the first device with support since it already contains an ESP32-S3. If you’d like to try it out with your favorite Z-Wave adapter, you should start by <a href=\"https://github.com/esphome/zwa-2\">taking a look at our ESPHome configuration</a> for the ZWA-2 (all that should need changing are <a href=\"https://github.com/esphome/zwa-2/blob/main/home-assistant-zwa-2-poe/home-assistant-zwa-2-poe.yaml#L43-L46\">the vendor and product IDs</a> to match the Z-Wave adapter).</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Is the Portable Z-Wave experiment limited to Home Assistant?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No. It is made to work directly with Z-Wave JS. If you use Z-Wave JS v15.15.0, either standalone or with another smart home platform, you are able to use it, too! Configure Z-Wave JS to connect to <code>esphome://&lt;IP OF THE ZWA-2&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I use Ethernet instead of Power-over-Ethernet?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes. Use a Power-over-Ethernet injector in combination with the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4h2T2q7\">Waveshare ESP32-S3-ETH board</a>.</p>\n",

As members of the community, they know how hard it can be to connect the devices that are already built into your home, whether they’re smart or not. That’s why Konnected’s first product was their drop-in replacement alarm panel boards, which allow you to take decades-old wired alarm systems and add them into Home Assistant.</p>\n<p>Another challenge the community was facing was garage door openers (GDOs), especially cloud-based openers. In the early days of Home Assistant, the community figured out the APIs for these providers and controlled them that way. Some manufacturers noticed this and <a href=\"/blog/2023/11/06/removal-of-myq-integration/\">put barriers up</a> blocking people from controlling the devices they own, claiming it as “unauthorized usage” 🙄.</p>\n<p>The community was naturally incensed, and did what tinkerers tend to do when a cloud gets in their way — they began tinkering with hardware. A community emerged to take back control of these devices, starting with projects like ratgdo, which Konnected used as a base for their work. Today, because of these projects, there are multiple great open source tools to control a large number of these GDOs, ranging from DIY schematics to finished controllers. Konnected has an open source solution which works locally, as well as having the form factor and safety standards to match. Even better, Konnected devices are available in over 60 countries.</p>\n<p>For anyone who has used Konnected for quite some time, you’ll notice that they had their own integration, which has <a href=\"/integrations/konnected/\">now been deprecated</a> in favor of the ESPHome firmware, so that it’s always straightforward to find (or build) the firmware you need. They even <a href=\"https://github.com/konnected-io\">publish all their code on GitHub</a> 👏, which allows the community to help them fix issues and add features.</p>\n<div class=\"alert\">\n<p>\"We've been users of Home Assistant ourselves since 2018 and thrilled to finally be officially part of the Works with Home Assistant program. Konnected shares many of the same founding principles as Home Assistant, including our commitment to 100% local control, open-source firmware, and high-quality hardware that makes your home smarter, safer and accessible to everyone.\"</p>\n<em style=\"text-align: right; display: block;\">- Nate Clark, Founder / CEO at Konnected</em>\n</div>\n<p>Konnected is another example of <a href=\"/integrations/esphome/\">ESPHome</a> (a project from the Open Home Foundation) fostering an entirely new ecosystem of Open Home projects. It works fully locally, and it’s perfect for tinkerers, allowing you to build DIY smart home devices yourself (get started with one of our <a href=\"https://esphome.io/projects/\">ready-made projects</a>). Konnected also have a thriving <a href=\"http://community.konnected.io\">community</a> of their own if you have questions or comments.</p>\n<p>Creators can also use it to make pre-built, plug-and-play products that give users a really seamless experience. Devices are easily discovered and added to your Wi-Fi network and Home Assistant, along with a one-click update within Home Assistant. To learn more about how Konnected uses ESPHome, look out for Nate on the next <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YfRkqCdD4c\">ESPHome live stream</a> on October 14!</p>\n<p>Remember, the development of projects like ESPHome from the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a> is supported by <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers and anyone who purchases Home Assistant hardware. While all of Konnected’s devices work locally, if you’re interested in remote access, allowing you to keep tabs on your home’s security when you’re out and about, check out <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a>.</p>\n<h2>Devices</h2>\n<p class=\"img\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2025-10-konnected/garage-door-opener.webp\" alt=\"Konnected Smart Garage Door Opener blaQ\">\n    The Konnected Smart Garage Door Opener blaQ\n</p>\n<p>For anyone new to the Works With Home Assistant program, it’s a way for us to formally certify devices that have been tested by our team, and help you know what works great out of the box with Home Assistant. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates. Works With Home Assistant is operated by the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a>, and the support of <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers funds this work. These items were all tested by members of the ESPHome team to see exactly how they function in their own homes.</p>\n<p>The Konnected certified devices are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://konnected.io/products/smart-garage-door-opener-blaq-myq-alternative\">Konnected Smart Garage Door Opener blaQ</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://konnected.io/products/smart-garage-door-opener\">Konnected Smart Garage Door Opener White (v2)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://konnected.io/collections/smart-alarm-panels\">Konnected Alarm Panel Pro</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Let’s Konnect</h2>\n<p>A nice benefit of retrofitting your old wired security system is not needing to maintain loads of battery-powered sensors 🪫. The Alarm Panel Pro has the ability to connect 12 zones (security speak for individual or joined up sensors), it also allows you to connect keypads and sirens, and includes 12V power for the devices that need that.  It’s highly customizable, and there’s also plenty of support available if you need <a href=\"https://support.konnected.io/\">help with installation</a>.  You can power it using 12V or Power-over-Ethernet, or both! The Alarm Panel Pro is designed to be always-on, and they’ve designed it to consume very little power. This also allows it to easily run for hours on their <a href=\"https://konnected.io/products/backup-battery\">backup battery</a>.</p>\n<p>You’ll also probably be wondering why there are two different variants of the garage door openers, and that’s because each supports a different set of manufacturers. There is a <a href=\"https://konnected.io/collections/shop-now\">wizard</a> to help you figure out which variant will work with your opener. Between the Konnected GDO blaQ and White, you get support for some of the biggest manufacturers out there, including Chamberlain, LiftMaster, Craftsman, Merlin, Genie, Stanley, and more.</p>\n<p>Even with the Konnected controlling your garage door opener, you’re still able to use the included remote or the original manufacturer’s app (if you like that kind of torture). The GDO White features a built-in optical laser sensor that detects whether your garage door is open or closed. The GDO blaQ offers control over the opener’s light and lock, and can even partially open the door (for openers that support these features).</p>\n<p>As we mentioned at the top, it’s great to have more products added to the program that help people get the most out of the things they already own. A big part of the Open Home Foundation’s mission is sustainability in the smart home, and Konnected are helping our community get longer lasting use of their existing security and garage door systems.</p>\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: If I have a device that is not listed under ‘Works with Home Assistant does this mean it’s not supported?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No! It just means that it hasn’t gone through a testing schedule with our team or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program. It might function perfectly well, but has not yet been added to the testing schedule, or it might work under a different connectivity type that we don’t currently test under the program.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Ok, so what’s the point of the Works with program?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that the devices must have full functionality within Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud and will continue to do so long-term.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How were these devices tested?</strong></p>\n<p>A: All devices in this list were tested using a standard Home Assistant Green Hub with the ESPHome integration.  If you have another set-up that’s not a problem, but we test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will you be adding more Konnected devices to the program?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Why not! Konnected are also looking to do some exciting things with Matter soon, so we’re excited to work together on any upcoming releases or add in further products that are not yet listed here.</p>\n",

Thanks for all the feedback! ❤️</p>\n<h3>The sidebar is resizable</h3>\n<p>Working on an action that is too complex for a small sidebar? Maybe one with a few YAML fields? You can now resize the sidebar to adapt the layout to your current task!</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the automation editor with the sidebar expanded on the right. The sidebar is larger in this screenshot, as it can now be resized.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-10/automation-editor-resizable-sidebar.png\" />\n<h3>CTRL+V</h3>\n<p>We previously introduced keyboard shortcuts to copy and cut.</p>\n<p>Pasting was more complex to bring to life because you can paste a block (trigger, condition, action) in many different locations in your automation. In this release, we introduce a really simple pattern. If you previously copied a block, you can paste it below any block simply by selecting it and pressing CTRL+V.</p>\n<p>Another very simple, but very welcome, quality-of-life improvement to the automation editor!</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screen recording showing how to copy and paste blocks in the automation editor; it especially highlights how a pasted block is pasted after the block you've selected.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-10/automation-editor-copy-paste.gif\" />\n<h3>The overflow menu is back</h3>\n<p>We initially relocated the overflow menu (the menu that appears when you click the <code>⋮</code>) with all the options related to a block on the sidebar, thinking this would make the flow cleaner.</p>\n<p>Due to popular demand and helpful feedback that some actions were more difficult to reach (such as testing a condition or running an action), we decided to bring it back to the main section of the editor as well.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the automation editor with the overflow menu open on an item in the automation editor flow. This showcases all items are back, including disabling, copy, and pasting parts.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-10/automation-editor-overflow-menu.png\" />\n<h3>Undo/Redo</h3>\n<p>We’ve all been there: you’re building a complex automation, make a mistake, and want to revert it, only to find out that it’s really not simple. Up until now, the only way to revert some unsaved changes made to an automation was to close it and start over again… A very painful workflow.</p>\n<p>This release introduces an Undo functionality (and its associated Redo). You can now undo up to 75 steps back in your automation editing history (and redo them if you want). Standard keyboard shortcuts (CTRL+Z and CTRL+Y) are also available! An amazing contribution from <a href=\"https://github.com/jpbede\">@jpbede</a>, thanks!</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screen recording showing how to undo and redo changes in the automation editor with the new back- and forward-arrows that are shown in the top right of the automation editor.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-10/automation-editor-redo-undo.gif\" />\n<h3>Repeat repeat repeat repeat</h3>\n<p>Finally, we noticed some unwanted complexity in our <a href=\"/docs/scripts/#repeat-a-group-of-actions\">“repeat” building block</a>, which allows you to repeat one or multiple actions for as long as you need to.</p>\n<p>This complexity stemmed from the fact that we were trying to cover four main use cases in a single block.</p>\n<p>We decided to split this building block into four smaller ones, with simpler descriptions explaining each use case. Nice!</p>\n<p>Here’s how they were separated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Repeat multiple times</strong> - Repeat a sequence of actions a fixed number of times.</li>\n<li><strong>Repeat until</strong> - Repeat a sequence of actions until a condition is satisfied. The condition is checked after each run of the sequence.</li>\n<li><strong>Repeat while</strong> - Repeat a sequence of actions as long as a condition is satisfied. The condition is checked before each run of the sequence.</li>\n<li><strong>Repeat for each</strong> - Repeat a sequence for each element of a list.</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the repeat building block, now consisting of four distinct blocks for each use case.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-10/automation-editor-split-repeat.png\" />\n<div class=\"alert alert-note\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>\n  <div class=\"alert-content\">\n<p>For our advanced users: This evolution is only cosmetic. The YAML format of the repeat block does not change; this means your existing automations will not be affected by this change.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Automation editor feedback</h3>\n<div class=\"alert alert-tip\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:lightbulb-outline'></iconify-icon> Tip</p>\n  <div class=\"alert-content\">\n<p>One of Home Assistant’s greatest strengths is our community.

build with this!</p>\n<h2>Dashboards get smarter - let your home suggest what to show</h2>\n<p>In the last release, we introduced the Home dashboard, offering a simpler way to control and monitor your smart home if you don’t have the time, energy, or need to customize your own dashboard in detail.</p>\n<p>Now we’ve added a new concept: sections of suggested entities. This follows a basic algorithm that suggests entities you have interacted with the most in the past. It then shows these entities based on the hour of the day, with only relevant controls being suggested.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new prediction entities that are now put onto the experimental home dashboard. These are common entities you often interact with.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-10/home-dashboard-prediction-entities.png\" />\n<div class=\"details-block\">\n  <details class='details-block-item'>\n    <summary class='details-block-title'>\n      <span>Adding prediction entities to any dashboard</span>\n      <div class='details-block-arrow'>\n      <svg class=\"down\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M7.41,8.58L12,13.17L16.59,8.58L18,10L12,16L6,10L7.41,8.58Z\" /></svg>\n      <svg class=\"up\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M7.41,15.41L12,10.83L16.59,15.41L18,14L12,8L6,14L7.41,15.41Z\" /></svg>\n      </div>\n    </summary>\n    <div class='details-block-content' id=\"content_1\">\n<p>If you’re creating a manual dashboard with sections, you can integrate these prediction controls directly into it. The setup follows a section-based approach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add a new section.</li>\n<li>Open and edit the YAML of that section.</li>\n<li>Replace the entire section YAML with the following snippet:</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"language-yaml highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code data-lang=\"yaml\"><span class=\"na\">strategy</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"na\">type</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">common-controls</span>\n  <span class=\"na\">title</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">Common controls</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n</div>\n  </details>\n</div>\n<div class=\"alert alert-tip\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:lightbulb-outline'></iconify-icon> Tip</p>\n  <div class=\"alert-content\">\n<p>One of Home Assistant’s greatest strengths is our community. We’re building this dashboard together, and your input will shape where it goes next. There are two ways to get involved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2pOf7WWNxmvcC8lH3NM5Ssf63y2pN3xP9HdlY09pr9goPqQ/viewform?usp=dialog\">Share your thoughts in our survey</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/1351536906437005313\">Join the conversation in the dashboard development channel on Discord</a></p>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2>Voice</h2>\n<h3>Hello, hola</h3>\n<p>For a very long time, ESPHome-based voice assistants (even the tiny Atom Echo) secretly <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/26/voice-chapter-7/#3x-wake-words-and-2x-accuracy\">supported multiple wake words</a> under the hood. With this release, we’re finally opening up this feature to you!</p>\n<p>You can now define two wake words and two assistants for every voice assistant in your home!</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the device page of a Home Assistant Voice PE, showcasing the new entities for setting the second wake word and voice pipelines associated with it.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-10/voice-2-wake-words.png\" />\n<p>This makes it straightforward to support dual-language households by assigning different wake words to different languages. For example, <em>“Okay Nabu”</em> could be used for French, while <em>“Hey Jarvis”</em> is used for English.</p>\n<p>Multiple wake words and assistants can be used for other purposes as well. Want to keep your local and cloud-based voice assistants separate? Easy! <em>“Okay Nabu”</em> could be used for a cloud-based assistant while <em>“Hey Jarvis”</em> is used for a local one.</p>\n<p>We’d love to hear feedback on how you plan to use multiple wake words in your home!</p>\n<h3>Beep boop</h3>\n<p>After a voice command, Assist responds with a short confirmation like <em>“Turned on the lights”</em> or <em>“Brightness set”</em>. This lets you know that it understood your command and took the appropriate actions. However, if you’re in the same room as the voice assistant, this confirmation can feel redundant since you can see or hear that the appropriate actions were taken.</p>\n<p>Starting with this release, Assist will detect if your voice command’s actions all took place within the same area as the satellite device. If so, a short confirmation “beep” will be played instead of the full verbal response. Besides being less verbose, this also serves as a quick reminder that your voice command only affected the current area.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-note\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>\n  <div class=\"alert-content\">\n<p>This feature does not work for AI-enabled Assistants, as they can generate a wide variety of responses that can’t be replaced with a simple beep.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

Thanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/felipecrs\">@felipecrs</a>!</li>\n<li>Using a <a href=\"/docs/automation/trigger/#webhook-trigger\">webhook trigger</a> in your automation? You can now make it even more dynamic by using a template for the <code>webhook_id</code>. Thanks, <a href=\"https://github.com/RoboMagus\">@RoboMagus</a>!</li>\n<li>We now have support for <code>MCF</code> (1000 Cubic Feet) as an alternate unit of measure for volume, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/ekobres\">@ekobres</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/xtimmy86x\">@xtimmy86x</a> added <code>m/min</code> for speed sensors, and <a href=\"https://github.com/pioto\">@pioto</a> added <code>inH₂O</code> pressure unit support.

The ‘more information’ dialogs for media players have a revamped design, offering a cleaner and more intuitive interface.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new more information dialog when you click on a media player entity. It now features album art and great controls over your media player.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-10/more-info-media-player.png\" />\n<h3>Sync zooming charts in the history panel</h3>\n<p>When you have multiple charts in the history panel, zooming in on one chart will now automatically zoom in on all other charts as well. This makes it easier to compare data across different entities. Well done, <a href=\"https://github.com/birrejan\">@birrejan</a>!</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screen recording showing the effect of all charts being in sync when scrolling or zooming. The recording shows how a change in one graph, affects all the others in the same way.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-10/history-sync-zoom.gif\" />\n<h3>Template &amp; YAML editors get a toolbar</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/TCWORLD\">@TCWORLD</a> has contributed a toolbar for the YAML and template code editors in our UI. This solves an issue where the previous floating button would float over the content of the editor and obscure it from view.</p>\n<p>The new toolbar also includes undo and redo buttons, bringing <a href=\"#undoredo\">the same convenient undo and redo functionality</a> we introduced for the automation editor to these code editors as well. Plus, there’s a nice little copy button to quickly copy your code! Nice!</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a YAML editor in our UI with the brand new toolbar that now additionally provides undo, redo, and copy buttons!\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-10/template-yaml-editor-toolbar.png\" />\n<h2>Patch releases</h2>\n<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.10 in October.\nThese patch releases only contain bug fixes.

Last month, we asked for submissions on how Home Assistant helps you, and today we will highlight our favorites! We will also take a look at all the cool milestones over the past year in the project, thanks to contributions from you all, and the new things coming up for the community. <!--more--></p>\n<h2>It’s a communal effort</h2>\n<p>When I (Missy Quarry) joined as the Community &amp; Social Media Manager in February 2024, I was still new to how an open source project the size of Home Assistant manages its community. Over the past 18 months, I’ve seen Home Assistant community members from all walks of life — whether DIY tinkerers or people simply looking to make small improvements at home — contribute in their own ways. By sharing your stories and inspiring others, you’ve helped the project grow.  For our 12th birthday, I want to celebrate these contributions, no matter the size or complexity. 😌</p>\n<p>Before I jump into celebrating all your amazing contributions and how they shape the projects managed by the Open Home Foundation, I have a couple of birthday presents for you. 🎁</p>\n<p>First, I’m thrilled to share our <a href=\"/community\">new Community website</a>! Right now, it’s a simple hub to find community information with ease, but we expect to evolve this over the coming months (or so). You’ll find links to our official community platforms, information on events, and details on meetups, including how to get reimbursed for certain fees as a host. In the future, I’d like to include links to regional communities we’re aware of and showcase more of the kinds of stories I’ll be sharing today.</p>\n<p><em>Feel like something’s missing from this new page? <a href=\"mailto:community@openhomefoundation.org\">Let me know</a>!</em></p>\n<p>Next, we’ve been working hard to do more of our development in the open. Last September, I redesigned the Discord server and in doing so I gated the <em>Developer</em> category behind a role. This has made it more difficult to develop in the open with the channels hidden behind a role, so we’re switching things up.</p>\n<p>As of this week, the Developer category is now <strong>read-only</strong> for every member. Want to take a peek into the future of Home Assistant? Head to the <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/1346914401508392980\">#projects channel</a> and see what contributors are talking about! Want to join in and contribute with either your feedback or skills? I’ve created <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/1346952081881436331\">an info thread</a> for the channel that explains how to assign yourself either the Developer or Designer role and unlock the ability to chat in the threads.</p>\n<p>Let’s jump into those submitted stories now… 🤩</p>\n<h2>Happily ever after</h2>\n<p>In my opinion, the best thing about Home Assistant is its flexibility - you can integrate such a wide range of devices into it and use their data to build a unique-to-your-home experience. And that’s exactly why I wanted to hear how you, the community, use it in your own home to benefit you. Here are my favorite stories you submitted - I hope one inspires your next project. ✨</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://jordan.roher.me/projects/home-automation/\">A coffee automation to improve Home Approval Factor</a>. ☕️ Jordan made a morning automation to avoid having the coffee grinder grind his morning mood.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>u/katschung helped their girlfriend fully accept Home Assistant by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1hrkku1/pokemon_style_floorplan/\">creating a dashboard with a retrogame-style floor plan</a>. 🕹️</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sythsaz uses Home Assistant to make sure their pupper is fed. 🐾 “<em>I’ve managed to make it so my dog’s food auto emails the vet then the response to the email gets put on my calendar so I know how long a bag of food lasts as well as adding the receipts to Google Drive.</em>”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://github.com/johannyren/PowerDisplayESPHome/tree/main\">PowerDisplayESPHome</a>, JannickBlmndl <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/JannickBlmndl/ESPHome-Dynamic-Prices-LEDMatrix\">made an LED matrix</a> that helps their household be more sustainable by being energy flexible. It displays the live energy prices from their energy provider. 📊</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TanoSpirits\">Tano Spirits</a> in Melbourne, Australia, uses Home Assistant to automate their Japanese Shochu distillery, inspired by a small brewing company in Singapore. 🍻</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Several years ago, HillPhantom found that Home Assistant wasn’t quite ready for him. Over the past year, though, he’s now got Ollama set up with his Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition and has been building guides on how to make your own <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb-4l93st8A\">mmWave radar sensors in Home Assistant</a>. 👋🏻</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Over just a few weeks, Pieter van Kampen recently integrated 190 devices that respond to voice control and more than 1200 active entities from his KNX home to create over 30 automations to help with everything from mowing the lawn to controlling shades based on the sun’s location and intensity. 🪟</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>MB used Zigbee buttons to help collect data for their son’s doctor after he developed some trouble sleeping. This gave excellent insight for the doctor to start looking into causes, and they even used the system remotely while doing further evaluation. 📈</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Graham Hosking took automations to another level (before we did) with his <a href=\"https://github.com/ITSpecialist111/ai_automation_suggester\">AI Automation Suggester</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/ITSpecialist111/Automation-Inspector\">Automation Inspector</a>. It takes the load off your brain by helping come up with new, clever automations! 🤖</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wessam Lauf fell down the rabbit hole that is Home Assistant once he got his setup running. Inspired by the Graphite theme and after some LLM vibe-coding, he wrote a template for his very own theme, <a href=\"https://github.com/wessamlauf/homeassistant-frosted-glass-themes\">Frosted Glass</a> - now available in <a href=\"https://www.hacs.xyz/\">HACS</a>. 🎨</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Too many of us anthropomorphize our homes, telling it to chill out when five things break the same day. Biofects took that to heart and created this <a href=\"https://streamable.com/hnoc63\">Home Assistant avatar</a> for his home (here’s a bonus, nightmare fuel <a href=\"https://streamable.com/xah2va\">first version</a>). 🫣</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Developers! 👏🏻 Developers! 👏🏻 Developers! 👏🏻</h2>\n<p>Our community is more than developers, it’s true. But we wouldn’t be the <a href=\"https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/\">largest open source project</a> on GitHub if we didn’t have a vibrant and active developer community. This ship sails largely due to their contributions, and we genuinely appreciate all of their efforts.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re eager to interview community members when we open new roles at the foundation. We’ve employed community members like <a href=\"https://github.com/joostlek\">Joostlek</a> (who designed the new <a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/\">Integration Quality Scale</a> and helps onboard new integrations into Core), <a href=\"https://github.com/TimoPtr\">Timo</a> (who is our first ever Android developer and has focused on <a href=\"/blog/2025/07/23/companion-app-for-android/\">polishing the Android app</a>), and <a href=\"https://github.com/maximmaxim345\">Maxim</a> (a talented developer from the Music Assistant community who works on both Music Assistant and ESPHome and is one of our newest additions to the team). Their contributions have helped shape how things work around here, but it was their contributions as community members that helped pave the way for their joining the foundation. These are just a select few of the <em>several</em> new hires at the foundation who were active community members.</p>\n<p>(Have you checked our <a href=\"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/openhomefoundation/\">jobs page</a> recently to see what roles are open? 👀)</p>\n<p>With our community of contributors and working with Nabu Casa on the hardware design, we have successfully launched a few new pieces of hardware. The <a href=\"/voice-pe/\">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a> brought in language experts from every corner of the world to help ensure our language coverage is the most robust in the industry. Thanks to contributors, we support languages like Greek, Icelandic, and more recently Irish Gaeilge! 😎 We had community contributors help make sure the Home Assistant <a href=\"/connect/zwa-2/\">Connect ZWA-2</a> was prepared for launch last month. Sincerely, we couldn’t be more grateful for your support and efforts in these spaces.</p>\n<p>Here are some fun stats from our GitHub contributors (<a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/core/graphs/contributors?from=9%2F9%2F2023\">commits on our Core repo</a>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Last 12 months (Sept - Aug) - 14,385</li>\n<li>Previous 12 months - 14,503</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A SPECIAL CONGRATULATIONS to <a href=\"https://github.com/bdraco\">bdraco</a>, who just last week surpassed <a href=\"https://github.com/balloob\">balloob</a> (the founder of Home Assistant) as the contributor with the most commits!</p>\n<div class=\"contain nb\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2025-09-12th-anniversary/contributors.webp\" alt=\"Top 8 contributors of all time for home-assistant/core\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:700px;\">\n    The top 8 contributors of all time in home-assistant/core👏🏻\n</div>\n<p>This is just a small peek into all the hard work that goes into maintaining Home Assistant - we have more repositories than just Core, and every single contribution is valued.</p>\n<p>Honorable dev mention from the submitted community stories - I couldn’t leave Joostlek’s (joke) submission out. 🤣</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our very own Head of Developer Relations (his words), Joost Lekkerkerker, says Home Assistant helps keep him off the street. He’s just launched <a href=\"https://joostlek.dev/what-is-a-smart-home/\">his new blog</a> that talks about his vision of a smart home, and how he was inspired to not buy Tuya Wi-Fi lights after seeing my experience with some path lights.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Our humble gratitude</h2>\n<p>Community is the core of what we do and the heart of Home Assistant. We thrive because you care and contribute your valuable time to support our collective success. Whether you found our platform because you wanted more privacy from big tech, were intrigued by the number of choices implemented into a single app, or needed something to track your sustainability efforts — you support our values every day. Thanks for choosing us, and thank you for all you do to help support the foundation and the projects we maintain.</p>\n<p>A very special thanks to all our <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers and anyone who has purchased our official Home Assistant hardware. These support the full-time development of Home Assistant (along with ESPHome, Music Assistant, and so much more), and are the easiest way to ensure these projects keep getting cool new features!</p>\n<p>We have more things coming down the line for you. In the near future, we plan on announcing a new merch store 👕. In the first half of next year, I’ll announce when Home Assistant Community Day 2026 will be. We’re already working with Nabu Casa on the next exciting hardware announcement (no spoilers…for now). And that’s not even touching the industry events we plan on attending, the State of the Open Home, and so much more. I’m excited to take you all on the journey we’re already working on over the next 12 months, and I’m always looking forward to another year of amazing contributions. 😌</p>\n<script>\n    if (!document.cookie.split('; ').find(row => row.startsWith('12th-blog-confetti='))) {\n        const d = new Date();\n        d.setTime(d.getTime() + (24*60*60*1000)); // Once a day only\n        let expires = \"expires=\"+ d.toUTCString();\n        document.cookie = \"12th-blog-confetti=1;\" + expires + \";path=/\";\n\n        const script = document.createElement('script');\n        script.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/canvas-confetti@1.9.3/dist/confetti.browser.min.js';\n        script.onload = () => {\n            // launch confetti.

      "Content": "<img src='/images/blog/2025-09-ai/art.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Building the AI-powered local smart home\">\n<p>Last year, we laid out <a href=\"/blog/2024/06/07/ai-agents-for-the-smart-home/\">our vision for AI in the smart home</a>, which opened up experimentation with AI in Home Assistant. In that update, we made it easier to integrate all sorts of local and cloud AI tools, and provided ways to use them to control and automate your home. A year has passed, a lot has happened in the AI space, and our community has made sure that Home Assistant has stayed at the frontier.</p>\n<p>We beat big tech to the punch; we were the first to make AI useful in the home. We did it by giving our community complete control over how and when they use AI, making AI a powerful <em>tool</em> to use in the home. As opposed to something that takes over your home. Our community is taking advantage of AI’s unique abilities (for instance, its image recognition or summarizing skills), while having the ability to exclude it from mission-critical things they’d prefer it not to handle. Best of all, this can all be run locally, without any data leaving your home!</p>\n<p>Moreover, if users don’t want AI in their homes, that’s their choice, and they can choose not to enable any of these features. I hope to see big tech take an approach this measured, but judging by their last couple of keynotes, I’m not holding my breath.</p>\n<p>Over the past year, we’ve added many new AI features and made them easy to use directly through Home Assistant’s user interface. We have kept up with all the developments in AI land and are using the latest standard to integrate more models and tools than ever before. We’re also continuing to benchmark local and cloud models to give users an idea of what works best. Keep reading to check out everything new, and maybe you can teach your smart home some cool new tricks.</p>\n<p class=\"img\">\n    <lite-youtube videoid=\"iZ-JdpxEx3o\" videotitle=\"Multiple commands with Ollama\"></lite-youtube>\n    Local AI is making the home very natural to control\n</p>\n<p>Big thanks to our AI community contributor team:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter\">@AllenPorter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/shulyaka\">@shulyaka</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/tronikos\">@tronikos</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/IvanLH\">@IvanLH</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Joostlek\">@Joostlek</a>!</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Supercharging voice control with AI</h2>\n<p>We were doing voice assistants before AI was cool. In 2023, we kicked off our <a href=\"/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/\">Year of the Voice</a>. Since then, we’ve worked towards our goal of building all the parts needed for a local, open, and private voice assistant. When AI became the rage, we were quick to integrate it.</p>\n<p>Today, users can chat with any large language model (LLM) that is integrated into Home Assistant, whether that’s in the cloud or run locally via a service like <a href=\"/integrations/ollama/\">Ollama</a>. Where <a href=\"/voice_control/\">Assist</a>, our home-grown (non-AI) voice assistant agent, is focused on a predetermined list of mostly home control commands, AI allows you to ask more open-ended questions. Summarize what’s happening across the smart home sensors you’ve <a href=\"/voice_control/voice_remote_expose_devices/\">exposed to Assist</a>, or get answers to trivia questions. You can even <a href=\"/voice_control/assist_create_open_ai_personality/\">give your LLM a personality</a>!</p>\n<p>Users can also leverage the power of AI to speak the way <em>they speak</em>, as LLMs are much better at understanding the intent behind the words. By default, Assist will handle commands first. Only questions or commands it can’t understand will be sent to the AI you’ve set up. For instance, <em>“Turn on the kitchen light”</em> can be handled by Assist, while <em>“It’s dark in the kitchen, can you help?”</em> could be processed by an AI. This speeds up response times for simple commands and makes for a more sustainable voice assistant.</p>\n<p>Another powerful addition from the past year is context sharing between agents. So your Assist agent can share the most recent commands with your chosen AI agent. This shared context lets you say something like <em>“Add milk to my shopping list,”</em> which Assist will act on, and to add more items, just say <em>“Add rice.”</em> The AI agent understands that these commands are connected and can act accordingly.</p>\n<p class=\"img\">\n    <lite-youtube videoid=\"mLtFUG4YG1A\" videotitle=\"Current state of conversational AI - September 2025\"></lite-youtube>\n    Here is an excellent walkthrough video of JLo's AI-powered home, showing many of these new features in action\n</p>\n<p>Another helpful addition keeps the conversation going; if the LLM asks you a question, your Assist hardware will listen for your reply. If you say something like “It’s dark”, it might ask whether you’d like to turn on some lights, and you could tell it to proceed. We have taken this even further than other voice assistants, as you can now have Home Assistant initiate conversations. For example, you could set up an automation that detects when the garage door is open and asks if you’d like to close it (though this can also be done without AI with a very clever <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.home-assistant.io%2Fblueprints%2Fblog%2F2025-07%2Fask_yes_no_question.yaml\">Blueprint</a>).</p>\n<p>AI pushed us to completely revamp our Text-to-Speech (TTS) system to take advantage of streaming responses from LLMs. While local AI models can be slow, we use a simple trick to make the delay almost unnoticeable. Now, both <a href=\"https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl\">Piper</a> (our local TTS) and <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> TTS can begin generating audio as soon as the LLM produces the first few words, improving the speed of the spoken response by a factor of ten.</p>\n<p><strong>Prompt: “Tell me a long story about a frog”</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Setup</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Time to start speaking</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Cloud, non-streaming</td>\n<td>6.62 sec</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cloud, streaming</td>\n<td>0.51 sec (13x faster)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Piper, non-streaming</td>\n<td>5.31 sec</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Piper, streaming</td>\n<td>0.56 sec (9.5x faster)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>Ollama gemma3:4b on an RTX 3090, and Piper on an i5</em></p>\n<h2>Great hardware to work with AI</h2>\n<p>People built some really cool voice hardware, from landline telephones to little talking robots, but the fact that it was so DIY was always a barrier to entry. To make our voice assistant available to everyone, we released the <a href=\"/blog/2024/12/19/voice-preview-edition-the-era-of-open-voice/\">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a>. This is an easy and affordable way to try Home Assistant Voice. It has some seriously powerful audio processing hardware inside its sleek package. If you were on the fence about trying out voice, it really is <a href=\"/voice-pe/\">the best way to get started</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"img\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2025-09-ai/voice-pe.webp\" style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition\">\n    Voice Preview Edition is not only open and powerful, but it looks and feels great too!\n</p>\n<p>It’s now easier than ever to set up your Assist hardware to work with LLMs with our <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/voice_assistants/\">Voice Assistants</a> settings page, and you can even assign a different LLM to each device. The LLM can recognize the room it’s in and the devices within it, making its responses more relevant. Assist was built to be a great way to control devices in your home, but with AI, it becomes so much more.</p>\n<h2>AI-powered suggestions</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/2025/08/06/release-20258/\">Last month</a>, Home Assistant launched a new opt-in feature to leverage the power of AI when automating with Home Assistant. The goal is to shorten the journey from a blank slate to your finished idea.</p>\n<p>When saving an automation or script, users can now leverage the new Suggest button: <img src=\"/images/blog/2025-09-ai/suggest.webp\" style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'> When clicked, it will send your automation configuration along with the titles of your existing automations and labels to AI to suggest a name, description, category, and labels for your new automation. Over the coming months, we’re going to explore what other features can benefit from AI suggestions.</p>\n<div class=\"contain nb\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2025-09-ai/suggest-button.webp\" alt=\"A rename modal open with the new Suggest button top right\">\n</div>\n<p>To opt-in to this feature, you need to take two steps. First, you need to configure an integration that provides an <a href=\"/integrations/?cat=ai\"><em>AI Tasks</em> entity</a>. For local AI, you can configure Ollama, or you can also leverage cloud-based AI like Google, OpenAI, or Anthropic. Once configured, you need to go to the new <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_ai_task/\">AI Task preferences pane</a> under <strong><em>System -&gt; General</em></strong> and pick the AI Task entity to power suggestions in the UI. If you don’t configure an AI Tasks entity, the Suggest button will not be visible.</p>\n<div class=\"contain nb\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2025-09-ai/ai-suggestions.webp\" alt=\"The AI Suggestions setting within Home Assistant\">\n</div>\n<h2>AI Tasks gets the job done</h2>\n<p>Enabling <a href=\"/integrations/ai_task/\">AI Tasks</a> does more than quickly label and summarize your automations; its true superpower is making AI easy to use in templates, scripts, and automations. AI Tasks allow other code to leverage AI to generate data, including options to attach files and define how you want that data output (for instance, a JSON schema).</p>\n<p>We have all seen those incredible community creations, where a user leverages AI image recognition and analysis to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1lytyv9/parking_spot_detection/\">detect available parking spots</a> or <a href=\"https://houndhillhomestead.com/google-gemini-powered-goose-coop-door/\">count the number of chickens in the chicken coop</a>. It’s likely that AI Tasks can now help you easily do this in Home Assistant, without the need for complex scripts, extra add-ons, or HACS integrations.</p>\n<p>Below is a template entity that counts chickens in a video feed, all via a short and simple set of instructions.</p>\n<div class=\"language-yaml highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code data-lang=\"yaml\"><span class=\"na\">template</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n<span class=\"na\"> - triggers</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n<span class=\"na\">     - trigger</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">homeassistant</span>\n<span class=\"na\">       event</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">start</span>\n<span class=\"na\">     - trigger</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">time_pattern</span>\n<span class=\"na\">       minutes</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">/5\"</span>\n<span class=\"na\">   actions</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n<span class=\"na\">     - action</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">ai_task.generate_data</span>\n<span class=\"na\">       data</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n<span class=\"na\">         task_name</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">Count chickens</span>\n<span class=\"na\">         instructions</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"pi\">&gt;-</span>\n<span class=\"err\"> </span><span class=\"s\">          This is the inside of my coop.

It defines that the output should always be a number, since we want to use that information in Home Assistant. All of this is embedded in a template entity that automatically updates every 5 minutes. An AI Task could also be embedded in an automation, a script, or any other place that can execute actions.</p>\n<div class=\"contain\">\n    <img src=\"/images/blog/2025-09-ai/activity.webp\" alt=\"Activity view in Home Assistant of the doorbell image analyzed by AI Tasks\">\n    An automation triggers an AI Task to identify what caused motion on a camera.\n</div>\n<p>Lastly, users can set a default AI Task entity. This allows users to skip picking an entity ID when creating AI automations. It also lets you migrate everything that uses AI Tasks to the latest model with a single click. This also makes it easy to share blueprints that leverage AI Tasks, like this blueprint that analyzes a camera snapshot when motion is detected:</p>\n<p><a href='https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.home-assistant.io%2Ft%2Fai-camera-analysis%2F911634' class='my badge' target='_blank'><img src='https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg' /></a></p>\n<h2>MCP opens a whole new world</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/integrations/mcp/\">Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP) is a thin layer allowing LLMs to integrate <em>anything</em>. When the specification was announced, we quickly jumped on it and integrated it into Home Assistant. Effectively, these servers give Home Assistant’s Assist conversation agent access to all sorts of new tools. You could connect MCP servers that give Assist access to the latest news stories, your to-do lists, or a server that catalogues your vinyl collection, allowing you to have richer conversations (<em>“Okay Nabu, which Replacements albums do I have, and which aren’t on my Vinyl-to-Purchase list?”</em>).</p>\n<p>On the flip side, you can also <a href=\"/integrations/mcp_server/\">turn Home Assistant into an MCP server</a>, allowing an AI system to access information about your home. For instance, you could create a local AI that’s great at making Home Assistant automations, and it could include all your entity names or available actions. MCP keeps gaining more support, and there are some great cloud and self-hosted solutions available.</p>\n<h2>How to pick a model</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of models available, it’s hard to know where to start. Luckily, Home Assistant’s resident AI guru <a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter\">@AllenPorter</a> is here to help. He has put together an incredibly useful <a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports\">Home LLM Leaderboard</a>. This dataset includes his extensive tests of cloud and local LLM options, and even has tests that give small local LLMs a fighting chance (see <a href=\"https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports#assist-mini\">assist-mini</a>).</p>\n<p>Currently, the charts show the big cloud players’ most recent models ranking pretty close to each other, while recent local models that use 8GB or more of VRAM are nearly keeping up. In the past, there was a big disparity between most models, but now it’s hard to go wrong.</p>\n<p>This is especially helpful as the options for LLMs in Home Assistant have just grown exponentially with the addition of <a href=\"/integrations/open_router\">OpenRouter</a>, a unified interface for LLMs. With OpenRouter, users can access over 400 new models in Home Assistant, and it supports AI Tasks right from day one. We really are spoiled for choice.</p>\n<h2>The future is Open, and Open Source</h2>\n<p>Home Assistant is open. We believe that you should be in control of your data, and your smart home. All of it. Local LLMs and the way we have architected Home Assistant extends this choice to the AI space, all while maintaining your privacy.</p>\n<p>Most crucially, we’ve made all of this open source. We are community-driven and work on this together with our community. The Open Home Foundation has no investors and is not beholden to anyone but our users. Our work is funded through hardware purchases and <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscriptions, allowing us to make all the technology we build free and open.</p>\n",

You can read all about it in our <a href=\"/blog/2025/08/13/home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/\">announcement blog 📰</a> or re-watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-pUkM6XIuA\">product launch live stream on YouTube 📺</a>.</p>\n<p>It was a busy month, as we also had two new <a href=\"https://works-with.home-assistant.io/\">Works with Home Assistant</a> program partners joining this month as well: <a href=\"/blog/2025/08/21/airgradient-joins-works-with-home-assistant/\">AirGradient</a> and <a href=\"/blog/2025/09/02/frient-joins-works-with-home-assistant/\">Frient</a>! 🎉</p>\n<p>While the above was happening this month, as if the project wasn’t already busy enough, we kept on pushing to prepare for this release; and it is an absolute <strong>massive</strong> one! 🤯</p>\n<p>This month introduces a new experimental Home dashboard, which aims to become the new default dashboard for Home Assistant in a future release. A first iteration, of which we love to see your feedback and input on. As you know, we develop and iterate in the open. Give it a shot and let us know what you think!</p>\n<p>Talking about dashboards, my personal favorite card is definitely the <a href=\"/dashboards/tile/\">tile card</a>; it is just so versatile. And this release brings in a staggering amount of new features for it! Most notably, the ability to add a trend graph to the tile card! 📈</p>\n<p>I’m the most excited about the visual changes to the automation editor this release brings: a sidebar. It is a huge and very visible change, that just makes so much sense. This release denotes the start of a whole series of improvements to the automation editor in this, and upcoming releases. As automations make a smart home feel magical, I personally can’t wait to see how this evolves. 🤖</p>\n<p>Enjoy the release!</p>\n<p>../Frenck</p>\n<!--more-->\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#automation-editor-sidebar\">Automation editor sidebar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#introducing-the-home-dashboard\">Introducing the Home dashboard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#new-tile-card-features\">New tile card features</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#trend-chart\">Trend chart</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#media-player-controls\">Media player controls</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#bar-gauge\">Bar gauge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#fan-direction-and-oscillation-controls\">Fan direction and oscillation controls</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#buttons\">Buttons</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#valve-openclose-and-position-controls\">Valve open/close and position controls</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#setting-the-date\">Setting the date</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#integrations\">Integrations</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#new-integrations\">New integrations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#noteworthy-improvements-to-existing-integrations\">Noteworthy improvements to existing integrations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#integration-quality-scale-achievements\">Integration quality scale achievements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#now-available-to-set-up-from-the-ui\">Now available to set up from the UI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#farewell-to-the-following\">Farewell to the following</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#other-noteworthy-changes\">Other noteworthy changes</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#analog-clock\">Analog clock</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#storage-insights\">Storage insights</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#patch-releases\">Patch releases</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#202591---september-5\">2025.9.1 - September 5</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#202592---september-12\">2025.9.2 - September 12</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#202593---september-13\">2025.9.3 - September 13</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#202594---september-19\">2025.9.4 - September 19</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#need-help-join-the-community\">Need help?

We have big plans, all based on tons of research, and with this release… we are shipping the first part of all this work, with the intent to gradually add more improvements over multiple releases!</p>\n<p>This release tweaks the automation editor user interface experience by introducing a sidebar! If you select an item in your automation, instead of that item expanding, it will open a new sidebar to the right with the settings for that selected item.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showcasing a sidebar in our automation editor.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-09/automation-sidebar.png\" />\n<p>This allows you to keep an overview of your automation on the left side of your screen, while you can tweak its behavior on the right. Of course, we have thought of smaller screens as well. On mobile, instead of the sidebar, a sheet will pop up at the bottom of the screen. This pop-up is also resizable, making it easier than ever to edit an action while reviewing your triggers.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing how on a smaller screen device a sheet is shown from the bottom of the page.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-09/automation-bottom-sheet.png\" />\n<p>Besides the sidebar, we have made tons of other little improvements as well. Tiny layout and styling changes that you will definitely notice as they really help with the overall readability. For example, small lines and borders around grouped elements have been added, making it easier to distinguish between different parts of your automation. Oh! And drag-and-drop support is now available on mobile! 🎉</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-tip\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:lightbulb-outline'></iconify-icon> Tip</p>\n  <div class=\"alert-content\">\n<p>One of Home Assistant’s greatest strengths is our community.

We’ve looked at a lot of your dashboards you’ve shared on socials, and talked to many of you about how you organize all your smart home devices and services. The goal? Making dashboards faster and easier to create, while still making them very customizable.</p>\n<p>With this release, we’re introducing a brand-new <em>Home dashboard</em>. The purpose is simple: to give you easy access to the right information at the right time.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of the new Home dashboard\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-09/home-dashboard.png\" />\n<p>The dashboard adapts to your Home Assistant experience level: powerful enough for advanced users, yet approachable for newcomers. We’re working to have it earn its name, and hope it will eventually become your new <em>Home</em> page. As always, it’s optional; you can always pick your own dashboard. This is the first iteration, and we’ll continue developing it in the open.</p>\n<p>When you first open the Home dashboard, it gives you a quick way to navigate to useful summaries for your light, climate, security, and media devices. You can also browse by areas, getting an overview of all the devices and services associated with that part of your home.</p>\n<p>We’re also introducing Favorites. You can pin any entity to the top, whether it’s a light, climate, or a person. We’d love to see what you choose (more on this in the future).</p>\n<p>The Home dashboard is not just about quick control. It also brings insights and information about your home. This first release includes weather and energy cards. It’s a simple start, and we have a lot of ideas to explore with you. For example, helping you create your first automation, or show discovered devices.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot of the new Home dashboard viewing the living room area\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-09/home-dashboard-area.png\" />\n<p>For now, the Home dashboard is considered experimental. Configuration options are limited, and it’s guaranteed to evolve. It won’t appear automatically, and if you want to try it you’ll need to add it manually in the <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/lovelace_dashboards/\">dashboard settings</a>, by adding a new “Home” dashboard.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-tip\">\n  <p class=\"alert-title\"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:lightbulb-outline'></iconify-icon> Tip</p>\n  <div class=\"alert-content\">\n<p>One of Home Assistant’s greatest strengths is our community. We’re building this dashboard together, and your input will shape where it goes next. There are two ways to get involved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://forms.gle/2Djeie5Cbwqmy8BR9\">Share your thoughts in our survey</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/1351536906437005313\">Join the conversation in the dashboard development channel on Discord</a></p>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2>New tile card features</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/dashboards/tile/\">tile card</a> is the most versatile card we have in our arsenal\nof <a href=\"/dashboards/\">cards for our dashboards</a>.</p>\n<p>One superpower of the tile card is its “features”, which are small additions where you can add quick interactions to these cards. For example, a slider to control the brightness of a light or buttons for the speed presets of a fan. Features have been extended quite a bit in this release by a dedicated group of community members.</p>\n<h3>Trend chart</h3>\n<p>This release, an absolute banger is the addition of the trend chart features for tile cards created by <a href=\"https://github.com/MindFreeze\">@MindFreeze</a>.</p>\n<p>This feature adds a handy quick graph to the tile card, showing the history of a specific entity over time. For this initial version, the time window shown is 24 hours.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a tile card using the new trend graph feature\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-09/tile-features-trend-graph.png\" />\n<h3>Media player controls</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/timmo001\">@timmo001</a>, added tile card features for media player controls and volume! This makes the tile card now a viable alternative to the media player card. Awesome!</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a tile card using the new media player features\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-09/tile-features-media-player.png\" />\n<h3>Bar gauge</h3>\n<p>A new tile card feature, made by <a href=\"https://github.com/MindFreeze\">@MindFreeze</a>: The bar gauge!</p>\n<p>For this initial version, it works with sensors that use a percentage (<code>%</code>) for their unit of measurement.\nThis makes the card great, for example, for a battery overview dashboard. Nice work!</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a tile card using the new bar gauge feature\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-09/tile-features-bar-gauge.png\" />\n<h3>Fan direction and oscillation controls</h3>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/pcan08\">@pcan08</a> we now have a tile card feature to control fan direction and oscillation!</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a tile card using the new fan direction and oscillation features\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-09/tile-features-fan.png\" />\n<h3>Buttons</h3>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/dhoeben\">@dhoeben</a> we now have a tile card feature for buttons! He added these buttons for automation, script, and button entities. The text can be changed to display standard button text or custom text.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a tile card using the new button feature\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-09/tile-features-button.png\" />\n<h3>Valve open/close and position controls</h3>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/timmo001\">@timmo001</a> we now have a tile card feature to control the open/close and the position of valves.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a tile card using the new open/close and valve position features\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-09/tile-features-valve.png\" />\n<h3>Setting the date</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/timmo001\">@timmo001</a> continued and also added a new tile card feature to support date and datetime entities (including the input datetime helpers). It allows you to add a feature that allows for setting a date.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a tile card using the new date feature\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-09/tile-features-date.png\" />\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

Nice addition <a href=\"https://github.com/fetzerch\">@fetzerch</a>!</li>\n<li>Our voice guy <a href=\"https://github.com/synesthesiam\">@synesthesiam</a> has been busy with some great QoL improvements this release as well.\n<ul>\n<li>The intent handling for the default agent (non-LLM) now supports fuzzy matching. The technique ensures voice pipelines recognize many more sentences. This improvement is available for English only, while we are looking for ways to extend this to other languages.</li>\n<li>We now have built-in intents to control the volume of (active) media players! Like the song? Just ask Home Assistant to turn it up a notch!</li>\n<li>After all that dancing, you might have gotten a little warm. Hence in this release, we now also have intents to control fan speeds. Nice!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Analog clock</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/blog/2025/04/02/release-20254/#time-for-a-new-card!\">Home Assistant 2025.4, we introduced the clock card</a>, which provides a digital clock display for your dashboards.</p>\n<p>For this release, <a href=\"https://github.com/timmo001\">@timmo001</a> made this card more feature-rich by adding support for displaying the clock in a customizable analog clock style.

Frient is bringing its proven technology to the Works With Home Assistant program, as well as their Danish design that easily blends into almost any home.</p>\n<p>Recent Works With partners have brought Z-Wave, Matter, and even Bluetooth devices to Home Assistant, but it’s been <em>a couple of years</em> 😅 since Zigbee-specific devices have joined the program. Zigbee is one of the most popular open protocols that is used with Home Assistant, with hundreds of thousands of users making use of it today. It’s a proven technology that connects directly to Home Assistant, no cloud or Wi-Fi connection required. Zigbee is a mesh protocol, where some devices act as repeaters, strengthening the network as more are added. It was built from the ground up to power the smart home, and has been optimized to give devices really long (sometimes multi-year) battery life.</p>\n<div class=\"alert\">\n<p>\"Joining the Works With Home Assistant program is a proud milestone for frient. It reflects our strong commitment to open, user-centric smart home experiences and ensures that our products seamlessly integrate with one of the most trusted platforms in the market. For Home Assistant users, it means more choice and flexibility — and for frient, it strengthens our position as a key player in the connected smart home space.\"</p>\n<em style=\"text-align: right; display: block;\">- Martin Langballe, International Business Development Manager at frient</em>\n</div>\n<p>All you need to get started with Zigbee in Home Assistant is a Zigbee adapter or ‘stick’, such as the <a href=\"/connectzbt1/\">Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1</a> (wow, we released this in 2022, I wonder when we’re finally going to build a successor? 😉). By plugging the adapter into a USB port on your Home Assistant system, it should then discover the device and add the <a href=\"/integrations/frient/\">ZHA integration</a>. After that is set up, you can start adding devices to your Zigbee network.  We’ve even added in a cool <a href=\"/blog/2025/06/11/release-20256/#making-sense-of-bluetooth\">new visualization</a> so that you can see how your Zigbee devices interact with each other.</p>\n<p>ZHA is built with the support of the Open Home Foundation, and it even has a full-time developer (<a href=\"https://github.com/puddly\">@puddly</a>) dedicated to improving it and helping certify new Works With partner devices. Your support makes this possible, whether through a Home Assistant Cloud subscription or by purchasing official hardware.</p>\n<h2>Devices</h2>\n<p class=\"img\">\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-09-frient/energy-usage-data.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"A frient device attached to a energy meter\">\nWhen your energy company won’t provide your raw usage data, there’s always another way 😉\n</p>\n<p>In case you didn’t know, Works With Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box with Home Assistant. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works With Home Assistant is operated by the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a>, and the support of <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers funds this work.</p>\n<p>Our team has worked extensively with frient to ensure that the following items work seamlessly with Home Assistant.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frient.com/products/motion-sensor-pro\">frient Motion Sensor Pro</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frient.com/products/io-module\">frient IO Module</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frient.com/products/smart-plug-mini\">frient Smart Plug Mini</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frient.com/products/entry-sensor-2-pro\">frient Entry Sensor 2 Pro</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frient.com/products/smart-siren\">frient Smart Siren UK</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frient.com/products/smart-siren\">frient Smart Siren EU</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frient.com/products/intelligent-keypad\">frient Intelligent Keypad</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frient.com/products/water-leak-detector\">frient Water Leak Detector</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frient.com/products/smart-button\">frient Smart Button</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frient.com/products/intelligent-smoke-alarm\">frient Intelligent Smoke Alarm</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frient.com/products/air-quality-sensor\">frient Air Quality Sensor</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frient.com/products/smart-humidity-sensor\">frient Smart Humidity Sensor</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frient.com/products/electricity-meter-interface-2-led\">frient Electricity Meter Interface 2 LED</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a big portion of frient’s product line, and provides energy monitoring, device control, safety, and security sensors. The frient IO Module is the first certified Zigbee module that can be used to turn low-voltage dumb devices like electric blinds or garage doors into devices that can be controlled by Home Assistant.</p>\n<p>There are some great devices here for building a more sustainable smart home. The Electricity Meter Interface 2 LED allows you to get the data off your energy meter and record it into Home Assistant. Another win for sustainability is their use of AA and AAA batteries wherever practical, meaning you can use rechargeables instead of constantly buying and recycling coin cells.</p>\n<p>I also selfishly love to see some great UK-specific devices being brought into the program with the frient Smart Siren having both UK and EU versions.</p>\n<h2>Best frients forever</h2>\n<p>It’s great to see Zigbee get some high-quality certified Works With Home Assistant devices after a multi-year wait. Frient has put a good deal of work into this launch and are big fans of our work and the community. There are more exciting Zigbee developments to come, so stay tuned!</p>\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: If I have a device that is not listed under “Works With Home Assistant” does this mean it’s not supported?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No! It just means that it hasn’t gone through a testing schedule with our team or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program. It might function perfectly well but be added to the testing schedule later down the road, or it might work under a different connectivity type that we don’t currently test under the program.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Ok, so what’s the point of the Works With program?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that the devices must have full functionality within Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud, and will continue to do so long-term.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How were these devices tested?</strong></p>\n<p>A: All devices in this list were tested using a standard HA Green Hub with the ZBT-1 and with the ZHA integration. We haven’t tested these devices with Zigbee2MQTT, so we would recommend checking their <a href=\"https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/#v=Frient\">device compatibility documentation</a>. If you have another hub, Zigbee adapter, or integration, that’s not a problem, but we test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will you be adding more frient devices to the program?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Why not! We’re thrilled to foster a close relationship with the team at frient to work together on any upcoming releases or add in further products that are not yet listed here.</p>\n",

They bring their air quality monitors to the program, with both indoor and outdoor models.</p>\n<p>AirGradient is the first partner in the program focused on building advanced indoor and outdoor air quality monitors. They are also well known within our community for their powerful tech, and for their focus on open source and dedication to local air quality projects around the world.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>A breath of fresh air</h2>\n<p>AirGradient is the first partner to join that operates out of Thailand, and they initially started making their air monitors to help their local community. They actively support air quality improvement projects both in Thailand itself, but also globally. AirGradient donates monitors and has partnered with a variety of different organisations and NGOs, including <a href=\"https://www.airgradient.com/blog/open-source-to-change-the-world/\">UNICEF</a>. These monitors are often placed in schools, helping young people to better understand and work to protect their air quality.</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-08-airgradient/outdoors.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"An Open Air Monitor mounted outdoors in Vietnam\">An Open Air Monitor in Vietnam</p>\n<p>Community is central to our work with AirGradient. Their hardware and software are open source, just like our own. Plus, they’ve taken an active role in integrating into Home Assistant, bringing <a href=\"/integrations/airgradient/\">their local Wi-Fi integration</a> up to not just the gold, but the platinum tier on our <a href=\"/docs/quality_scale/\">integration quality scale.</a> Like all of our <em>Works With</em> partners, the devices work completely locally with no need for a cloud connection. What’s more, they really embrace the DIY aspect of the smart home, with their devices available fully assembled or as a build-it-yourself kit!</p>\n<p>AirGradient’s open approach even extends to the data collected by their community of users. Whilst completely optional, users can share their air quality readings with the world (which they <a href=\"https://www.airgradient.com/map/?zoom=1&amp;lat=49.2125578&amp;long=16.62662018&amp;org=ag&amp;meas=rco2\">visualize into an amazing map</a>). This helpful air quality map grows every time a user opts to share their data, and is a fantastic open resource for climate researchers, students, or anyone concerned about air quality in their local area. If your area is a blank spot on this map, that is all the more reason to buy an AirGradient outdoor monitor.</p>\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-airgradient/visual-map.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"An online AirGradient air quality map\">\n<p>Each kit comes with a screwdriver and is designed for easy repair. Broken sensor? Swap it out. Firmware update needed? Flash it yourself. Sustainability is one of the core guiding principles of the Open Home Foundation, and we love that repairability is built in. AirGradient also donates at least 1% of annual sales to non-profits and community direct donations. In fact, they asked us to include in this blog an open invitation to our community: If you have a local project that you think would benefit from open source air quality monitors, get in touch through <a href=\"https://www.airgradient.com/support/\">this link</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"alert\">\n    <p>\"We're excited to join the Works With Home Assistant program because it aligns perfectly with our open-source philosophy.

We rigorously test items in-house and provide feedback to the manufacturers to ensure that products work easily out of the box and provide a seamless experience. The Works With program is operated by the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a> and funded by the support of <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> Subscribers.</p>\n<p>AirGradient has certified the following devices with us:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.airgradient.com/indoor/\">AirGradient One - Indoor Air Quality Monitor</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.airgradient.com/outdoor/\">AirGradient Open Air - Outdoor Air Quality Monitor</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-08-airgradient/kitchen-counter.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"An AirGradient One sitting on a kitchen counter\">Finally, a metric to show precisely how badly you burned your dinner</p>\n<p>When we talk about sustainability in relation to the smart home, it’s easy to focus on energy management and reducing our carbon impact. However, with AirGradient, you can deep dive into the impacts of the release of CO2 and other air pollutants, better understanding what you, your family, and friends breathe in every day. With an in-house science team of atmospheric chemists and public health experts, they ensure that the monitors are accurate and each of the fully assembled monitors are tested in a dedicated test chamber.</p>\n<p>Whether you want to see if your new furniture is putting dangerous VOCs into the air, or if a smelly candle is going to aggravate any allergies, the use cases are endless. The AirGradient One also has a built-in display with both detailed data and a set of LEDs to show general air quality at a glance. Both devices measure carbon dioxide, VOCs, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, temperature, and humidity. AirGradient also provides helpful documentation on their website that helps you understand these measurements and the impact they can have on your household.</p>\n<p>These devices can not only give you in-depth information about the air in and out of your home, but they can also unlock powerful automations. We often see these devices paired with door or window open/close sensors, air purifiers, dehumidifiers, or air conditioners to reduce particulates in the home from pets or carpets.</p>\n<h2>Clearing the air</h2>\n<p>We’re so excited to be partnered with AirGradient. Their mission is important, and their open and sustainable approach is precisely what we love to see. Partnerships like this are only possible with the support of <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers.

Between its optimized antenna and seamless integration with Home Assistant, it should be a big upgrade for anyone using Z-Wave today.</p>\n<p>If you’re not using Z-Wave, it’s time to take a second look, as Connect ZWA-2 is a different beast. It might be just what you need to reach that tricky spot in your home… or even beyond. Connect ZWA-2 supports Z-Wave Long Range, and this modern take on the standard delivers exceptional reach along with more responsive, battery-efficient devices. Every home is different, but our testers have managed connections in places they once thought impossible.</p>\n<p>Join the smart home range revolution for <strong>$69 or €59</strong> (that’s the recommended MSRP, and pricing will vary by retailer). For quick details, specs, and where to buy, visit our <a href=\"/connect/zwa-2/\">Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 page</a>. It’s available for purchase today. Read on to learn what goes into the ultimate Z-Wave upgrade.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/connect/zwa-2\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-08-home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/buy.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Buy the Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2\"></a></p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>We love open standards</h2>\n<p>Open standards let you connect devices directly to Home Assistant for local, private control, and keep working for years, even if the manufacturer disappears. To make connecting these standards as seamless as possible, we like to build our own hardware.</p>\n<p>In late 2022, we launched <a href=\"/connectzbt1/\">Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1</a> (formerly SkyConnect), a USB adapter for Zigbee and Thread. It made both protocols much easier to get started with, and sales helped fund Home Assistant development. We knew the next standard to tackle was Z-Wave, and after another couple of hardware launches (<a href=\"/green\">Home Assistant Green</a> and <a href=\"/voice-pe/\">Voice Preview Edition</a>), we finally had the time to do it right.</p>\n<h3>Why Z-Wave?</h3>\n<p>If you’re new to Z-Wave, its key advantage over other open standards is its use of sub-GHz radio waves, which are better at getting through thick walls and reaching across large households. While Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Thread all compete for the same crowded airspace (2.4 GHz), Z-Wave operates in its own much quieter spectrum (865-926 MHz). Z-Wave is great for range, but its new <a href=\"https://z-wavealliance.org/what-is-z-wave-long-range-how-does-it-differ-from-z-wave/\">Z-Wave Long Range variant</a> builds even further on this… <em>but more on that later</em>.</p>\n<p>As the standard is over two decades old, it’s had a lot of time to iron out any kinks, but it also has over 4,500 certified devices to choose from. Our opt-in stats show over 130,000 Home Assistant households are using Z-Wave today. Several <a href=\"https://works-with.home-assistant.io/\">Works with Home Assistant</a> partners are building amazing Z-Wave products, including <a href=\"/integrations/zooz/\">Zooz</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/shelly_zwave/\">Shelly</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/ultraloq/\">Ultraloq</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/leviton_z_wave/\">Leviton</a>, and <a href=\"/integrations/homeseer/\">Homeseer</a>. You can also go to any local marketplace and pick up any working Z-Wave smart device, no matter how old, and it will still connect with Home Assistant!</p>\n<h2>Connect ZWA-2 in-depth</h2>\n<p>We’ve learned a lot about hardware since the launch of Connect ZBT-1, and we also knew we could breathe some new life into Z-Wave on Home Assistant. Making this device was the start of us leveling up the Connect platform and establishing our <strong>second generation</strong>, which is all about building the most performant and open design. That is why we jumped straight to <em>two</em> for this Connect ZWA-2!</p>\n<h3>Go big or go home</h3>\n<p>To be the most performant, we knew we had to ditch the “stick” form factor. It was never ideal, as USB ports can output a lot of interference. We even shipped a USB extender with Connect ZBT-1, and urged people to use it, as it kept the device away from any noisy components. Instead of building a stick we built an <em>adapter</em>, which includes an optimized standalone antenna and base that connects to your Home Assistant system with a USB cable.</p>\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/precisely-engineered.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Comparison of the Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 antenna to other Z-Wave antennas, showing the size difference\">\n<p>We’re not compensating for anything; a big antenna does make a big difference. For starters, you need an antenna that’s the right size for your wavelength. As Z-Wave is in the sub-GHz, this means the antenna has to be longer than your average Wi-Fi antenna (about 33 cm or a foot is the sweet spot).</p>\n<p>You need to optimize not just the antenna, but also the base of the device (also known as the <em>ground plane</em>). Our hardware experts really went deep into all the physics involved, and the results speak for themselves. Basically, by choosing the right ratio of antenna to base, the two work in harmony to maximize the range and reliability of the signal.</p>\n<p>While some Z-Wave adapters may claim they can hit the maximum transmit levels with their postage-stamp-sized antennas, that can sometimes come with a lot of interference. We’ve engineered away that problem. Connect ZWA-2 can speak loudly and clearly 🗣️, and what’s even more important, it’s a great listener 👂.</p>\n<h3>Positioning is everything</h3>\n<p>Having a big optimized antenna is great, but placement is almost as important. Its sturdy base and good-sized USB cable allow it to be placed in the right spot. No more will you have a dangling dongle hidden behind a server cabinet. We even put in an accelerometer to ensure people position the antenna upright, this ensures devices are in the sweet spot of the antenna. If you place it on its side, it will subtly blink the status light at the top.</p>\n<h3>All the Z-Wave</h3>\n<p>Inside Connect ZWA-2, we include the latest Z-Wave 800 chip, which supports all Z-Wave devices. We’re also Z-Wave certified, giving you that extra peace of mind. This, combined with Home Assistant’s industry-leading Z-Wave software, means Z-Wave has never been this good. On your certified smart devices, you might see Security 2 (S2), SmartStart, Z-Wave Plus, or Z-Wave Plus V2 — don’t worry, we support it all. One new feature we support that is getting people very excited is Z-Wave Long Range👇.</p>\n<h3>Go long</h3>\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/supports-all-devices.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Isometric view of the Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 revealing the internal PCB featuring the Z-Wave 800 chipset\">\n<p>Combining Z-Wave’s natural abilities with an optimized antenna has given us some impressive range, but we took it a few steps further. We added Z-Wave Long Range to Connect ZWA-2, which might be one of the most substantial updates to Z-Wave yet.</p>\n<div class=\"alert\">\n    <p><strong>Z-Wave Long Range</strong><br> Long Range doesn’t use mesh, where devices relay messages through each other to reach the hub. Instead, each device talks straight to your hub, which brings some benefits. It runs on the same frequency as regular Z-Wave but at a higher power, and uses new technology that lets it reach farther, handle more devices, respond faster, and save battery. Right now, it is only available in North America and Europe, and the selection of compatible devices is still growing. This is just scratching the surface; for more on this impressive tech, read a <a href=\"https://z-wavealliance.org/what-is-z-wave-long-range-how-does-it-differ-from-z-wave/\" target=\"_blank\">full breakdown</a> from our friends at the Z-Wave Alliance.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Z-Wave Long Range is different enough that it needs its own separate network. Connect ZWA-2 can run both Z-Wave and Z-Wave Long Range <strong>at the same time</strong>. When you add a Long Range capable device to Home Assistant, the setup wizard lets you choose which network to use. This way, you get the best of both worlds: a strong mesh network for your older devices, and the reach of Long Range for the newest devices that include support.</p>\n<h3>How long?</h3>\n<p class=\"img\">\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/zwa-2-prototype-testing.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Dominic with our stick prototype alongside DrZWave with the controller reference design.

Since then, we’ve optimized the design and achieved a line-of-sight range of 1.5 kilometers (0.9 miles) 🤯. This was under less than ideal circumstances (raining and within a car), and we think we could go even further.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The certifying engineer said it was “the best range she had ever seen”.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another test had it communicating via Z-Wave Long Range through several floors of concrete.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Testers with outdoor lights and internal brick walls have commented on how this is the first time they’ve had reliable connections with devices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Interesting Long Range use cases have included smart mailboxes that notify you when <em>you’ve got mail</em>, or contact sensors on garden gates.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every home and setup is different, so we can’t definitively say how far your devices will span. What we can say is that nothing else we’ve tested comes close to what Connect ZWA-2 can do.</p>\n<h3>Built for Home Assistant</h3>\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/plug-and-play.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 connected to a Home Assistant Green\">\n<p>Whenever we build new hardware, we step up our software development to match. You may have noticed a lot of love going into Z-Wave for Home Assistant. All Z-Wave users benefit from this, and when people buy Connect ZWA-2, they’re helping fund this development.</p>\n<p>Connect ZWA-2 is built for Home Assistant, and because of this, it’s super easy to get started with. We’ve built Connect ZWA-2 to support every region, no matter where you buy it from. When you plug in Connect ZWA-2, it automatically detects and sets your region using the location configured in your Home Assistant system.</p>\n<p>We’ve built handy wizards to help you set up your first Z-Wave network and to guide you in setting up new devices. A wizard also helps you quickly migrate from most Z-Wave adapters to Connect ZWA-2 in a couple of clicks. We also have the ability to update the firmware of Connect ZWA-2 right from Home Assistant, and update the firmware over-the-air (OTA) of Z-Wave devices in a single click.</p>\n<h3>ESP inside</h3>\n<p class=\"img\">\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/zwa-2-pcb.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Front and back of the PCB outside the shell of the Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2\">\nI’ll save you the time opening it up; here is the front and back of the PCB.\n</p>\n<p>As always, we’ve made Connect ZWA-2 easy to open. Just pop out the rubber feet and remove the four Phillips screws, with no glue or clips to get in the way. If you do open it up, you’ll see a familiar sight, an ESP32-S3. We’re using it as a USB controller, and it’s not running ESPHome. Yes, it does have a “Wi-Fi antenna”, but we’re not using it. We’ve provided a lot of easily accessible pins/pads, open source firmware files, unlocked bootloader, and good documentation, so feel free to tinker. We’ll also provide all the files to allow you to 3D-print the outer casing.</p>\n<h3>Blending into the home</h3>\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/in-the-home.webp' alt=\"Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 sitting on a shelf next to a plant and some books\">\n<p>It’s no small feat to make something 33 cm (1 ft) long look so subtle in the home. We’ve modeled its design after a candle and even used the top of the antenna as a status indicator. Its quality injection-molded exterior has a premium feel and shares many design cues from our sleek-looking Voice Preview Edition.</p>\n<h2>Join the smart home range revolution</h2>\n<p>Last year, we proclaimed in a blog that “<a href=\"/blog/2024/05/08/zwave-is-not-dead/\">Z-Wave is not dead</a>”, and this hardware is a testament to that belief. Even with new technologies being released every week, there’s still room to innovate with something tried and tested. We will always support technology that respects your privacy, allows you to control your devices without the cloud, all while keeping the things you already have in your home running for years to come.</p>\n<p>After 1600 words on a Z-Wave adapter, we’re obviously very proud of what we’ve built and excited to see what amazing things people will do with this labor of love. So, whether you’re a Z-Wave veteran or just interested in cool new technology, take a look at <a href=\"/connect/zwa-2/\">Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2</a> today.</p>\n",

I hope that you are maybe enjoying a well-deserved break as well! 🏖️</p>\n<p>Summer breaks or not, we are currently very busy with our next <strong>product launch</strong>! In case you have missed it, this upcoming Wednesday, August 13 (12:00 PM PT, 3:00 PM ET, 21:00 CEST), we will have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-pUkM6XIuA\">an extra live stream to announce the next big thing</a> in the Home Assistant Connect series! Be sure to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-pUkM6XIuA\">head over to YouTube to hit the reminder button</a> so you don’t miss it! <strong>Z-Wave is not dead!</strong> 🌊</p>\n<p>Alright, on to the release! We keep moving during summer and are excited to bring you the August release of Home Assistant!</p>\n<p>Let’s start with my personal favorite of this release: The improved experience when viewing a group, for example, a group helper with lights. 💡 When viewing such a group entity, you can now control the individual members of that group directly in that dialog. Super useful! I’m pretty sure that will be used a lot in our house.</p>\n<p>But as the release title suggests, this release brings in an important foundation for new AI opportunities in Home Assistant: <strong>AI Tasks</strong>.\nThink of it as a way to delegate tasks to AI and get back the result of that task in a structured way so it can be used.

Since that time, AI has seen a big surge in popularity within the Home Assistant community for <em>all kinds</em> of use cases. Funny notifications when the laundry is done, analyzing what’s happening on a camera or skipping the song when AI determines <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/1at0re0/out_of_my_42_automations_this_is_my_best_one_by/\">it’s a country song</a> 😅.</p>\n<p>Though AI gets many people excited, there are still people who would prefer not to have this technology in their smart homes. We want to accommodate everyone’s choices, whether that’s to use AI or not. These features won’t appear unless you set up an AI integration and configure some specific settings.</p>\n<p>Last year, we sat down to determine how all these use cases, all complicated to achieve, could be made accessible to everyone. The first thing that came out of this was <a href=\"/blog/2025/07/02/release-20257/#integration-sub-entries\">integration sub-entries</a>, which we shipped in the last release. It allows users to configure their Ollama server or API key for OpenAI <em>once</em>, and then create many different agents using different models or configuration underneath. In this release we’re building two new things you can optionally enable via these new sub-entries for AI integrations: <em>AI tasks</em> and <em>Suggest with AI</em>. We’re also introducing a new integration, OpenRouter, which is a unified LLM interface giving access to over 400 extra LLM models.</p>\n<p>Big thanks to our AI community contributors: <a href=\"https://github.com/AllenPorter\">@AllenPorter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/shulyaka\">@shulyaka</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/tronikos\">@tronikos</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/IvanLH\">@IvanLH</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/joostlek\">@joostlek</a>!</p>\n<h3>Streaming Text-to-Speech for Home Assistant Cloud</h3>\n<p>When you use Home Assistant Voice to talk to an AI, you can do a lot more than just control your home. LLMs can summarize the state of your home, and when using LLMs from Google and OpenAI, they can search the web to answer your questions with up-to-date information. This is great, but these answers can become quite long. Previously, voice responses wouldn’t begin until the AI had finished generating the entire answer, so longer replies meant a longer wait before anything was read aloud.</p>\n<p>When a user waits for Home Assistant Voice to respond, long wait times really hurt the experience. We have overhauled Home Assistant so our Text-to-Speech system can start generating the response audio before the full response is done generating. Last release we launched this for <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/create-link/?redirect=supervisor_addon&amp;addon=core_piper\">Piper</a>, our local Text-to-Speech system. In this release we’re making this available to the voices included in <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> – the best way of supporting the Home Assistant project.</p>\n<p><lite-youtube videoid=\"AZ0-8wW0UL4\" videotitle=\"Streaming Text-to-Speech with Home Assistant Cloud by Nabu Casa\"></lite-youtube></p>\n<p>This improvement will especially benefit users who use local AI (which can be slow in generating responses) or users who play long announcements on their speakers.</p>\n<h3>Integrate AI into your workflow using AI Task</h3>\n<p>AI Task is a new integration that allows you to generate data using AI. After you add the “AI Task” sub-entry in your AI of choice, the entity will appear in the integration. This allows you to attach files or cameras and ask it what is happening. The output can either be given in text or formatted in a data structure of your choice. This is all accessible from the new <code>ai_task.generate_data</code> action, which can be embedded in automations, scripts, and template entities.</p>\n<p>Below is an example of a template entity that updates every five minutes and counts the number of chickens in the coop. <a href=\"https://houndhillhomestead.com/google-gemini-powered-goose-coop-door/\">Example inspired by this blog post.</a></p>\n<div class=\"language-yaml highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code data-lang=\"yaml\"><span class=\"na\">template</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"na\">triggers</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"na\">trigger</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">homeassistant</span>\n        <span class=\"na\">event</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">start</span>\n      <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"na\">trigger</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">time_pattern</span>\n        <span class=\"na\">minutes</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">/5\"</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">actions</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"na\">action</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">ai_task.generate_data</span>\n        <span class=\"na\">data</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n          <span class=\"na\">task_name</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">Count chickens</span>\n          <span class=\"na\">instructions</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"pi\">&gt;-</span>\n            <span class=\"s\">This is the inside of my goose coop.

You can go to <a href='https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/general' class='my' target='_blank'><strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong></a> and configure what AI Task entity you want to use as the default. With a default set, you no longer have to specify an entity when generating data, making it easier to share blueprints.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the generic setting where you can set the default AI task entity to use\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-08/ai-suggestions.png\" />\n<p>Setting a default also does more: When a default is configured, and only then, a new type of button will start showing up in different places in Home Assistant:</p>\n<center>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Image of the new Suggest with AI button which you can find in Home Assistant now\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-08/suggest-with-ai.png\" />\n</center>\n<p>This button is not visible by default and will only appear if you enable it in the “AI suggestions” settings. For this release, the button has been added to the save dialog for automations and scripts. It helps users come up with a name, description, category, and label, while taking into account your current labels and other automation/script names. Keep in mind that generating this text sends the full contents of the automation or script, along with the names of your other automations/scripts and labels, to the LLM. So, this may be a task you will want to relegate to your shiny new local LLM.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new AI suggestions button in the save automation dialog and the suggestions it made for this automation\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-08/save-automation.png\" />\n<h2>Area dashboard improvements</h2>\n<p>We’ve added a small improvement to the areas dashboard based on your feedback. You can now choose to show the first camera in an area, or its image or icon, in the area dashboard editor.\nIt’s a simple way to make certain area cards stand out a bit more—especially handy if you want quicker visual access to specific spaces.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screen recording showing the area dashboard editor with options to display camera feeds, images, or icons in area cards\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-08/area-dashboard-settings.gif\" />\n<h2>Integrations</h2>\n<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>\nand improvements to existing ones!

All buttons have been redesigned with distinct styles, sizes, and visual priority variants, making it much easier to distinguish between primary, secondary, and less prominent actions. This marks the beginning of a broader effort to update other UI components for improved accessibility and consistency across Home Assistant.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mib1185\">@mib1185</a> added a new device class for <strong>absolute humidity</strong> with support for both sensor and number <span class='terminology'>entities<span class='terminology-tooltip'>An entity represents a sensor, actor, or function in Home Assistant.

Shelly is very well-established in both our ecosystem and the smart home world, so it’s great to formally certify a selection of their Z-Wave devices.</p>\n<p>Their retrofit smart switches and relays are amazing for turning all sorts of <em>dumb</em> devices, like light fixtures or ceiling fans, into devices you can easily control in <em>smart</em> new ways. Also, being Works with certified means they have been thoroughly tested, ensuring they give the best possible experience with Home Assistant.</p>\n<p>The variety of complex settings and functionality, like energy monitoring, makes them popular with our community doing advanced smart retrofits, like connecting an old garage door or motorized shutters. These are perfect for keeping non-smart devices out of the landfill and working for years to come.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>From A to Z-Wave</h2>\n<p>Shelly, originally launched in Bulgaria in 2017, has been a mainstay in our community for some years. They became known initially for their WiFi smart switches and relays that could be easily used locally, but now offer a wide range of smart devices and ways to connect them. For this first round of Works with Home Assistant certified products, the focus is firmly on the <a href=\"/integrations/zwave_js/\">Z-Wave</a> lines.</p>\n<p> If you’re not familiar with Z-Wave, it’s a well-established low-powered wireless technology designed with the smart home in mind. It uses an entirely different bit of radio spectrum than WiFi, meaning it has less chance of experiencing interference. This spectrum makes it better at getting through thick walls and communicating over longer distances — with the recent <a href=\"https://z-wavealliance.org/what-is-z-wave-long-range-how-does-it-differ-from-z-wave/\">Long Range</a> iteration of the standard, they can <a href=\"/blog/2024/05/08/zwave-is-not-dead/#range-testing-our-z-wave-stick-prototype\">communicate even further</a>.</p>\n<p>Given our focus on local control, items that work on Z-Wave are ideal if you want to avoid the cloud. Home Assistant will act as your Z-Wave controller using the <a href=\"https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-zwave-js-ui\">Z-Wave JS add-on</a> (another awesome Open Home Foundation project). So, all you need is a Z-Wave adapter to use alongside these devices. <em>If you haven’t purchased one yet, you might want to wait before hitting that buy button</em> 😉.</p>\n<p>Shelly shares our focus on interoperability, with items using a variety of protocols, while being available worldwide. These items are also super helpful for the energy-conscious. They have low power consumption, power metering, and can easily blend in with your current home decor, as they sit in the wall behind your existing switches.</p>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-07-shelly/pm-mini.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"Shelly Wave PM Mini in hand showing small size\">Mini? This thing is microscopic!</p>\n<h2>Getting Involved</h2>\n<p>We’ve been lucky enough to meet the Shelly team on several occasions, and they were kind enough to showcase <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?t=6897s\">how the Las Vegas Mob Museum uses Shelly and Home Assistant</a> during our annual ‘State of the Open Home’ event. In May, they went one step further and hosted one of our <a href=\"/blog/2025/06/24/community-day-2025-wrap-up/\">Community Days</a> in South Florida. It’s really exciting to see that partners who join the ‘Works with’ program don’t just see it as a badge to stick on a box, but a real chance to engage with, and contribute to, this amazing community.</p>\n<div class=\"alert\">\n    <p>\"Many of our users already rely on Home Assistant to power their smart homes, and we’ve seen firsthand how important local control, privacy, and flexibility are to them. By joining the <i>Works with Home Assistant</i> program, we’re reinforcing our commitment to open, reliable smart home solutions. With the upcoming launch of our <strong>Shelly Wave Long Range</strong> devices—offering wireless coverage of up to <strong>1 kilometer</strong> — we’re pushing the boundaries of what smart home technology can do. Combined with Home Assistant’s powerful platform, this will be a <strong>market-leading solution</strong>, capable of covering <strong>use cases no other ecosystem today can reach</strong>. Together, we’re building the future of smart homes: open, powerful, and ready for real-world demands.\"</p>\n<em style=\"text-align: right; display: block;\">- Leon Kralj, CTO at Shelly</em>\n</div>\n<h2>Devices</h2>\n<p>In case you didn’t know, Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a>, and the support of <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers funds this work.</p>\n<p><strong>What devices have been certified?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.shelly.com/products/shelly-qubino-wave-pm-mini\">Shelly Wave PM Mini</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.shelly.com/products/shelly-qubino-wave-i4\">Shelly Wave i4</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.shelly.com/products/shelly-qubino-wave-1pm-mini\">Shelly Wave 1PM Mini</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.shelly.com/products/shelly-qubino-wave-2pm\">Shelly Wave 2PM</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.shelly.com/products/shelly-wave-pro-1-pm\">Shelly Wave Pro 1PM</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whilst the Shelly Wave Pro 1PM sits in an electrical box, the remaining devices sit behind a standard plug, switch or device. This means they are a super cost-effective way to retrofit devices, which in turn reduces e-waste. The Minis are very small (duh), and so should fit in most tight places around the home, even with low-profile installations. The Shelly Wave 1PM Mini is the world’s smallest Z-Wave smart switch. In some areas of the world, you may need professional installation by a qualified electrician, so be sure to check your region’s regulations. If you’re a confident DIYer, Shelly has a lot of <a href=\"https://kb.shelly.cloud/knowledge-base/installation-guides\">helpful guides</a> on their site to walk you through installing it yourself.</p>\n<h2>The first of many waves</h2>\n<p>These devices are the first from Shelly to join the program, but certainly won’t be the last, as we look forward to many exciting developments with Z-Wave Long Range. Keep your eyes peeled for our upcoming hardware announcement that will work perfectly with our Z-Wave partners.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for your support (by subscribing to <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/#:~:text=the%20first%20boot.-,Official%20Home%20Assistant%20hardware,-Get%20the%20best\">buying official hardware</a>), which allows the Open Home Foundation to build these partnerships and certify new devices to join Works with Home Assistant.</p>\n<h3>FAQs</h3>\n<p><strong>Q: If I have a device that is not listed under ‘Works with Home Assistant does this mean it’s not supported?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No! It just means that it hasn’t gone through a testing schedule with our team yet or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program. It might function well but be added to the testing schedule later down the road, or it might work under a different connectivity type that we don’t currently test under the program. It may also have a feature missing in Home Assistant that we’re working to add.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Ok, so what’s the point of the Works with program?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that the devices must work well within Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud and will continue to do so long-term.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How were these devices tested?</strong></p>\n<p>A: All devices in this list were tested using a standard HA Green Hub, a Z-Wave adapter and with our <a href=\"/integrations/zwave_js/\">Z Wave integration</a>. If you have another hub / adapter / integration that’s not a problem but we test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will you be adding more Shelly devices to the program?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Absolutely. Shelly has a huge number of product lines and will be expanding their Z-Wave Long Range list. We’re sure they’ll keep our testers busy with a steady stream of devices to add.</p>\n",

This gives you not just the ability to view your Home Assistant instance on the go (or around the house) and takes advantage of many of the sensors available on the device while providing rich notifications to users.</p>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-07-android-companion/download-growth.png' alt=\"Screenshot of Android installation growth over time\"/>Very impressive growth in installs over the years!</p>\n<p>The Android app alone has seen over <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/android\">2,700</a> contributions!

This app doesn’t just support Android phones and tablets but also devices they connect to, specifically Android Auto, Android Automotive, and Wear OS.</p>\n<h3>Progress in the millions</h3>\n<p>They did all this work while reaching nearly <strong>1.5 million installs</strong>, with over 6 million total installs over the years. There are 400,000 daily active users and 1 million monthly active users. The phone app also has a very nice <strong>4.3-star rating</strong> on the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.homeassistant.companion.android\">Play Store</a> and <strong>2,800 stars</strong> on <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/android\">GitHub</a> 🤩. This feedback really helps us improve.</p>\n<p>It’s been over a year and a half since the Apple companion apps gained a full-time developer with the addition of the amazing <a href=\"/blog/2023/12/27/companion-app-for-ios-202312-lets-go/\">Bruno Pantaleão</a> 😎. Around the same time as Bruno was hired, we began looking for an Android developer, and let’s say that took a little longer.</p>\n<p>My name is Timothy Nibeaudeau, and as mentioned at the start, I’m your new dedicated Android engineer. As someone who has been using Home Assistant since 2018, I’m passionate about open source and smart home technology. I’ve been working in software development for nearly a decade, developing apps for all sorts of projects from medical-grade IoT products to smart toothbrushes 🪥.</p>\n<p>I am committed to bringing my talents to the project, but I cannot do it alone. The community is what makes Home Assistant special, and together, we can achieve even more. Specifically, I’d like to thank <a href=\"https://github.com/dshokouhi\">@dshokouhi</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jpelgrom\">@jpelgrom</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/JBassett\">@JBassett</a> for their years of work making this app what it is today!</p>\n<p>I’d also like to thank you! Your support (by subscribing to <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> and buying <a href=\"https://www.nabucasa.com/#:~:text=the%20first%20boot.-,Official%20Home%20Assistant%20hardware,-Get%20the%20best\">official hardware</a>) allows the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a> to hire dedicated developers. Dedicated developers keep development focused, helping the community to work together in delivering the feature they’re passionate about.</p>\n<h2>Since our last blog</h2>\n<img src='/images/blog/2025-07-android-companion/playstore-cards.jpg' class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Google Play Store screenshot cards for Home Assistant\"/>\n<p>Like I said at the top, it’s been a long time (over two years 🫢) since we’ve published a blog highlighting the improvements made to the Android app. You’ve probably been enjoying these new features for some time, but in case you missed it, here are some of the biggest improvements made by the community over that time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Health Connect sensors linked to your Android phone have been added, including heart rate, fitness data, and glucose levels (as always, you have complete control over what you share with your Home Assistant instance, and that data stays local).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By working with Android <a href=\"/blog/2023/07/20/year-of-the-voice-chapter-3/#native-assist-on-android\">natively</a>, Assist can now replace your phone’s (or Wear OS devices’) assistant.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can now set the Home Assistant app as your device’s default launcher, which is great for wall panel setups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We’ve updated our widgets to support some of the new features, like To-do lists.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wear OS has had its Tile capabilities improved and a new thermostat tile was added.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are now more Android Auto sensors, like speed and remaining range.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A simpler way to connect Wi-Fi compatible devices to your home network (such as the Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition) using <a href=\"https://www.improv-wifi.com/\">Improv Wi-Fi</a> over Bluetooth (an open standard for connecting devices to Wi-Fi using Bluetooth, built by the Open Home Foundation).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Z-Wave device onboarding experience has been improved with the addition of a QR code scanner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We’ve also improved the speed and stability of the app.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s now easier than ever for new contributors to jump in and start helping with the app (much more on that below 👇).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a full list of the app’s capabilities, check out our <a href=\"https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/core/\">breakdown of the companion apps from the companion documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>What’s next for our Android app</h2>\n<p>In our latest update of the Android app <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/android/releases/tag/2025.7.1\">2025.7.1</a>, we’ve added a couple of useful features. Including a new basic invite flow, which will be shared between Android and iOS, adding a good layer of consistency between our most-used companion apps. The idea is to make it much more seamless to add new users or set up new devices (no need to type the URL in your Android Automotive device!).</p>\n<p>We’ve also made <a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/\">My Links</a> work better. If you’re unfamiliar with My Links, they’re those cool links (<a href=\"https://my.home-assistant.io/create-link/\">that anyone can make</a>) that bring you right to an integration, blueprint, add-on, or settings page. They have always worked great on desktop, but up until recently, they were a bit clunky to use on mobile. Now you can get to the link’s destination with a single click.</p>\n<p>Android has many different screen sizes and layouts, and we’re working to better leverage them with edge-to-edge support. Our recent update has edge-to-edge working on Android native UI elements like the settings page, and we’re looking to implement them elsewhere in future updates so we can make the most of your screen real estate.</p>\n<h2>Important changes for Android users</h2>\n<p class=\"img\"><img src='/images/blog/2025-07-android-companion/android-distribution.png' alt=\"Pie chart of installations over different Android versions from the Play Store\"/>A huge percentage of our users are on pretty new versions of Android, but we want to support as many older devices as possible.</p>\n<p>One significant change on the horizon is ending support for Android 5.0 and 5.1 (also known as Android Lollipop, released in 2014… it had a good run 🫡). <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/versions/all-channel#:~:text=Note%3A%20Starting%20in%20June%202025%2C%20new%20releases%20of%20many%20AndroidX%20libraries%20previously%20targeting%20minSdk%2021%20will%20be%20updated%20to%20require%20minSdk%2023.%20Some%20libraries%20won%27t%20be%20re%2Dreleased%20and%20will%20therefore%20continue%20to%20support%20minSdk%2021.\">Google has announced</a> that starting in June 2025, many AndroidX libraries will require a minimum of Android 6.0 (API 23). Google has already updated <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/android#messaging_v25-0-0\">Firebase Cloud Messaging</a> to require this as well. This means we will need to stop supporting Android 5.0 and 5.1 (API 21 and 22) to keep up with new features and security updates. Less than 0.3% of installs are on Android versions below API 23 (Android 6.0), and we always work to keep older devices working, but sometimes our hand is forced. If you are using an older device, the app will not be removed, but you will not receive new updates once we make this change. We plan to make one final release for these older versions before support ends. This release is expected before the end of the summer, so you will have the latest updates available for your device before we move on.</p>\n<h2>Let’s work together</h2>\n<p>We want to make it easier for you to contribute, whether you are a seasoned developer or just getting started. This includes making the contribution journey smoother and giving people an easy place to start. We’ve even compiled a list of <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/android/contribute\">“first issues” to tackle for prospective developers</a> looking to help out. We’ve started work on dedicated <a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/android\">Android developer documentation</a>, which will give in-depth information about the inner workings of this app.</p>\n<p>We’ve made many behind-the-scenes changes to improve the developer experience (defining best practices, linters for faster/automated feedback, and continuous integration for quicker feedback on PRs). Our focus is always on improving stability, reducing crash rates, and catching issues early. One example of this is our new fail-fast <a href=\"https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/android/best_practices/?_highlight=failfa#fail-fast\">approach</a>, which has already helped us catch and fix issues early.</p>\n<p>We want more Android native/exclusive features while also balancing the need to keep parity between the Android and iOS companion apps (the iOS app is excellent, and each app’s community is learning so much from each other).</p>\n<h3>How you can help</h3>\n<p>The companion app for Android is a community effort, and your help makes a real difference. Here is how you can get involved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.homeassistant.companion.android\">Join the beta program</a> to test new features.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/c/feature-requests/13\">Suggest a feature</a> and share your ideas.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Help triage issues on <a href=\"https://github.com/home-assistant/android/issues\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/1284965926336335993\">Discord</a>, or the <a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/tag/android\">Home Assistant forum</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Join the Android Project <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/1346948551892009101\">thread</a> on Discord.

We have tested many new devices of all different types, ensuring they provide the best experience possible with Home Assistant. As well as classic staples for the smart home, they also bring some very cool flood protection devices to help safeguard your home.</p>\n<p>These will be the first certified <a href=\"/integrations/zwave_js/\">Z-Wave</a> devices added to the program in some time, and are just part of the exciting future the Home Assistant community and Zooz see for this smart home protocol.<!--more--></p>\n<h2>Zooz zooms in</h2>\n<p>Zooz started out not as a manufacturer, but as a retailer of smart devices. They focused so much on customer support that they soon realized they could do a better job than manufacturers already in the market, and so turned instead to creating their own products. They focus on Z-Wave for its interoperability and security, and they include easy-to-understand installation guides with these devices. They also have a wide knowledge base on their website and a very responsive support team.</p>\n<p>As Z-Wave experts, they’re members of the Z-Wave Alliance (where <a href=\"/blog/2024/09/24/we-are-joining-the-z-wave-alliance-board/\">Paulus is also a member</a> as the voice of the open source community). While Zooz is based in the USA, many of their products are available worldwide.</p>\n<h2>It takes Zooz</h2>\n<p>Zooz has really embraced the Home Assistant community. Agnes, their VP of Brand and Partnership Support, recently spoke to the team over at the Home Assistant podcast about their startup journey. She also came along to our Community Day in Brooklyn, hosted by our very own Product Lead, <a href=\"https://github.com/madelena\">Madelena</a>. It’s awesome to see manufacturers get out and connect with our community members.</p>\n<p><lite-youtube videoid=\"dobq10nGoS0\" videotitle=\"The evolution of Zooz with Agnes Lorenz | Home Assistant Podcast\"></lite-youtube></p>\n<div class=\"alert\">\n    <p>\"Zooz has been contributing quality hardware to the smart home community for over 10 years now and our biggest takeaway is that thoughtful integration is key for our customers. We recognize that our devices are part of an ecosystem and that's why we are so excited to partner with Home Assistant, a platform we highly respect for its commitment to making products work together seamlessly. I especially appreciate how quickly Home Assistant embraced Z-Wave Long Range and how easy it is to set up Z-Wave on a brand new system thanks to hardware like Home Assistant Green. We look forward to connecting with the Home Assistant community, learning together, and creating new devices driven by your feedback.\"</p>\n<em style=\"text-align: right; display: block;\">- Agnes Lorenz, VP, Brand and Partnership Support, Zooz.</em>\n</div>\n<h2>Devices</h2>\n<p>In case you didn’t know, Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a>, and the support of <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers funds this work.</p>\n<p>Zooz has had a large group of devices certified, one of the largest number of devices we’ve ever certified for a launch into the program.

If you are based elsewhere, like in Europe, Long Range won’t be enabled quite yet. The reason is that even though the Z-Wave Long Range protocol has been available for some time in North America, it was only released in Europe in April 2025, as certification took a bit longer. The nice thing about Zooz’s North American 700 series and European 800 series Z-Wave, is that ZWLR can be enabled via an over-the-air (OTA) firmware update, so hopefully everyone will be taking part in the Z-Wave Long Range revolution soon. Watch this space for a not-so-secret Home Assistant Z-Wave hardware announcement coming your way…</p>\n<p>Z-Wave Long Range opens up a whole new world of options and makes for an even more flexible smart home. Maybe you have a large backyard, or an awkwardly shaped long, but narrow home that is hard to get other protocols to cover adequately. Or perhaps you have devices that are just too far away for other protocols. A common example is wanting a way to get notified when the mailbox at the front of your driveway is opened or closed.</p>\n<p>Many of the certified devices can function outdoors or be purchased with accessories to make them waterproof. Speaking on a personal note, we had a leak in our garage a year or so ago after some bad weather. Other protocols couldn’t reach that far, and we had no way to be notified. I cannot wait for an easy way to be notified across that bigger distance, and avoid all the unpleasant clean-up.</p>\n<p>It’s great to read stories on social media or our forums where smart home devices have kicked in and saved the day, like getting that all-important notification or cutting off the water supply with something like Zooz’s valve actuator.</p>\n<p><lite-youtube videoid=\"7k8Vm-CVhmg\" videotitle=\"Video of the valve actuator\"></lite-youtube></p>\n<p>Z-Wave, like other open standards we support, works locally, and all of the devices listed above will work locally, without the need for any extra cloud connection or apps. Remember, if you’re also looking for remote access to make sure you don’t miss any critical notifications while you’re away from home, an easy way to get this set up is to subscribe to <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a>. Not only will this help you monitor your smart home remotely, but you’ll also be supporting the development of Home Assistant.</p>\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: If I have a device that is not listed under “Works with Home Assistant” does this mean it’s not supported?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No! It just means that it hasn’t gone through a testing schedule with our team or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program. It might function perfectly well, but be added to the testing schedule later down the road, or it might work under a different connectivity type that we don’t currently test under the program.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: OK, so what’s the point of the Works with program?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that the devices must have the expected functionality within Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud, and will continue to do so long-term.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How were these devices tested?</strong></p>\n<p>A: All devices in this list were tested using a standard HA Green Hub with our Z-Wave Integration. If you have another hub integration that’s not a problem, but we test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will you be adding more Zooz devices to the program?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Absolutely! We’re thrilled to foster a close relationship with the team at Zooz to work together on any upcoming releases or add in further products that are not yet listed here.</p>\n",

Nuki creates some slick-looking smart locks that you can fit to most doors (or even on top of existing locks). They are constantly pioneering new and exciting features, while also using the open standards we support. Nuki is today bringing three different lock types to the program, all certified by our team to provide the best experience possible with Home Assistant.<!--more--></p>\n<h2>Unlocking their origin</h2>\n<p>Nuki started just over 10 years ago, with their first smart lock that was called the ‘magic black box’. It was this award-winning design that evolved into the sleek Nuki Smart Locks that are available today.  Keeping everything in the family, the brand was started by brothers Martin and Jürgen. Frustrated with the hassle of carrying a door key in their sports kit, the brothers launched a successful Kickstarter and have been innovating ever since. They design their smart locks in Austria and manufacture them in Europe. Their locks are available across Europe, and in early July, they launched the Nuki Smart Lock in the U.S.</p>\n<p>Nuki devices are certified for use with the <a href=\"/integrations/matter/\">Home Assistant Matter integration</a>, which is now <a href=\"/blog/2025/03/10/matter-certification/\">officially certified</a>. Like all ‘Works with’ certified devices, Nuki locks prioritize local control, so you can manage your day-to-day home security without relying on a cloud connection.</p>\n<div class=\"alert\">\n    <p>\"Joining the 'Works with Home Assistant' program is a logical step for us. We believe strongly in the power of open ecosystems and giving control to our customers. Home Assistant represents a vibrant community dedicated to innovation and customization, and we are thrilled to align our products with this vision.

The speediest of these is called the ‘Insane’ setting. This ultra-fast setting is ideal for those in a hurry, but you can also pick from ‘standard’ or ‘gentle’ to move at a more leisurely pace. The gentle setting is also perfect for quieter unlocking, so you’re not disturbing others if you’re coming home after a night shift or an early morning jog.</p>\n<p>We love that the cylindrical devices come with a rechargeable battery to reduce e-waste. Each cylindrical lock comes with both white and black band options, so you can match your existing hardware or your home’s style. The Nuki Smart Lock Pro can retrofit over a current lock, whereas the Nuki Smart Lock Ultra comes with its own cylinder.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a solid entry-level choice instead, the Nuki Smart Lock Go is a great option, which uses four AA batteries. Both the Smart Lock Go and Smart Lock Pro can be installed in under five minutes, with no drilling or special tools required, which may mean even if you’re renting you could install a smart lock. Works with Home Assistant is all about providing more choice to the community, and Nuki is expanding the smart lock offerings.</p>\n<h2>A keyless future</h2>\n<p>All of the models listed work locally, as this is a requirement of the ‘Works with’ program so that you can ensure you feel safe and secure in your smart home. However, some users may wish to access these devices remotely too, allowing you to unlock the door for guests, contractors, family, or friends. If you’re looking for remote access, this can either be provided by the Nuki App, or via your Home Assistant system with something like <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> (which supports the development of Home Assistant but also helps bring more ‘Works with’ partners to the program 🤝).</p>\n<p>We’re really excited to have Nuki join our certified devices, and see the use cases the community will come up with to integrate their smart locks into the rest of their smart home.</p>\n<h3>FAQ ON WORKS WITH HOME ASSISTANT</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Q: If I have a device that is not listed under ‘Works with Home Assistant’ does this mean it’s not supported?</strong></em></p>\n<p>A: Most Nuki locks will work via Matter with Home Assistant and we have even tried out a couple of older locks with good results. However, we have only officially tested and certified the devices listed above. If there is any other device missing from this list it just means that it hasn’t gone through testing with our team or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program. It might function well, and may be added to the testing schedule later down the road, or it might work under a different connectivity type that we don’t currently test under the program.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: Ok, so what’s the point of the Works with program?</strong></em></p>\n<p>A: It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. We look for brands that will bring their key functionality into Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud logins, and continue to do so long-term.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: How were these devices tested?</strong></em></p>\n<p>A: All devices in this list were tested using a standard Home Assistant Yellow with the built-in Thread border router and our <a href=\"/integrations/matter/\">certified Matter Integration</a>.  If you have another hub, border router setup, or integration, that’s not a problem. We test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: Will you be adding more Nuki devices to the program?</strong></em></p>\n<p>A: All of the locks Nuki currently sells are now represented here in the ‘Works with’ program. We’re thrilled to foster a close relationship with the team at Nuki to work together on any upcoming releases or add in further products that are not yet listed here.</p>\n",

It’s hot out there! 🌡️ While most of Europe is dealing with a heat wave right now, we’re here to cool things down with an exciting July release that’s packed with features I’m genuinely excited about.</p>\n<p>Before we dive in, if you missed it, we recently published <a href=\"/blog/2025/06/25/voice-chapter-10/\">Voice Chapter 10</a> where we explored moving beyond reactive voice assistants that only respond when you talk to them. Instead, we envisioned a future where your voice assistant can be conversational and initiate conversations. Speaking of that, this release delivers on that vision in a big way!</p>\n<p>I’m absolutely stoked about the new Ask Question action for Assist! 🗣️ This is something that sets Home Assistant apart from every other voice assistant out there. Finally, your voice assistant can take the initiative and ask <em>you</em> what your smart home should do. No more waiting for wake words, your assistant can start the conversation when it makes sense. It’s the kind of feature that gets me really excited thinking about all the possibilities.</p>\n<p>The redesigned Area card is another winner! 🏠 I’ll probably be replacing a few tile cards I’ve been using to navigate to my area dashboards with this new, more flexible version. It integrates beautifully with the Sections dashboard and gives you so many more options for controlling your spaces.</p>\n<p>And that’s just the beginning! We’ve got integration sub-entries making integrations even more extensible, full-screen code editors for those lengthy YAML and template edits, and tons of quality-of-life improvements throughout.</p>\n<p>Stay cool, and enjoy the release!</p>\n<p>../Frenck</p>\n<!--more-->\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#let-assist-ask-the-questions\">Let Assist ask the questions!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#redesigned-area-card\">Redesigned Area card</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#improving-the-areas-dashboard-overview\">Improving the Areas dashboard overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#integration-sub-entries\">Integration sub-entries</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#integration-page-gets-an-overhaul\">Integration page gets an overhaul</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#integrations\">Integrations</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#new-integrations\">New integrations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#noteworthy-improvements-to-existing-integrations\">Noteworthy improvements to existing integrations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#integration-quality-scale-achievements\">Integration quality scale achievements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#now-available-to-set-up-from-the-ui\">Now available to set up from the UI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#farewell-to-the-following\">Farewell to the following</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#other-noteworthy-changes\">Other noteworthy changes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#full-screen-code-editors\">Full-screen code editors</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#improved-dashboard-creation-experience\">Improved dashboard creation experience</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#patch-releases\">Patch releases</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#202571---july-4\">2025.7.1 - July 4</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#202572---july-14\">2025.7.2 - July 14</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#202573---july-18\">2025.7.3 - July 18</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#202574---july-28\">2025.7.4 - July 28</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#need-help-join-the-community\">Need help?

Until now, Assist was mostly transactional, meaning when you would say something, you would get a response or it would perform an action, and that would be the end of it (unless some LLM magic jumped in). With this release, we’re taking a big step forward: meet the new Ask Question action.</p>\n<p>This lets you build custom conversations from the comfort of our automation engine. Ask a question, handle the answer, and keep the interaction going.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"The new 'Ask Question' action\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-07/ask_question.png\" />\n<p>This action even allows you to define expected answers so that our extremely fast speech engine, Speech-to-Phrase, can train on them. Yes, fully local, custom conversations!</p>\n<p>To help you get started, we have provided a blueprint that covers the most common use case — Asking a closed Yes/No question:</p>\n<p><a href='https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.home-assistant.io%2Fblueprints%2Fblog%2F2025-07%2Fask_yes_no_question.yaml' class='my badge' target='_blank'><img src='https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg' /></a></p>\n<p>This blueprint allows you to focus on what you want to do if you answer positively or negatively to any question that your voice assistant will ask. The blueprint supports 50 different ways of saying “Yes” and “No” (including phrases like “Make it so” and “Let’s not”). Here it is in action!</p>\n<p><lite-youtube videoid=\"m-Vgr-9DtUU\" videotitle=\"Local conversations are supported with Assist\"></lite-youtube></p>\n<p>In case you want to dive deeper into conversation building, here is an example on how to ask a question and process the different answers:</p>\n<div class=\"details-block\">\n  <details class='details-block-item'>\n    <summary

href=\"/dashboards/area/\">Area card</a> offered a way to display an <span class='terminology'>area<span class='terminology-tooltip'>An area in Home Assistant is a <a href=\"/docs/organizing/\">logical grouping</a> of devices and entities that are meant to match areas (or rooms) in the physical world: your home. For example, the <code>living room</code> area groups devices and entities in your living room.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/organizing/areas/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> overview within the dashboard. However, it wasn’t fully compatible with the <a href=\"/dashboards/sections/\">Sections</a> dashboard, which limited its practical use in that context.</p>\n<p>The card has now been completely redesigned with a look and feel similar to the <a href=\"/dashboards/tile/\">Tile card</a>. It integrates seamlessly into the Sections dashboard thanks to its flexible layouts. You can choose between a compact version that shows only an icon and the area name, or a more detailed view featuring elements like your camera feed and buttons to toggle your lights or fans.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing multiple configurations of the revamped area card.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-07/area-card.png\" />\n<p>The control section itself has also been revamped, allowing you to choose which controls to include and rearrange them as you want. As a result of these changes, if you’re currently using the area cards, you’ll need to reconfigure the controls on them.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the card now supports controlling <a href=\"/integrations/cover/\">cover</a> <span class='terminology'>entities<span class='terminology-tooltip'>An entity represents a sensor, actor, or function in Home Assistant. Entities are used to monitor physical properties or to control other entities. An entity is usually part of a device or a service.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/entities_domains/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>.</p>\n<h2>Improving the Areas dashboard overview</h2>\n<p>The April release introduced an experimental <a href=\"/dashboards/dashboards/#areas-dashboard\">Areas dashboard</a>, designed to automatically generate a ready-to-use interface based on the configured areas within the home. However, the preview could become cluttered if you had a lot of devices in a room.</p>\n<p>This release introduces an all-new overview that leverages the redesigned Area card, making it easy to view and control your main devices by room with a single click. It also acts as a navigation hub, giving you quick access to detailed views of each area.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new area dashboard using the new area cards.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-07/areas-dashboard.png\" />\n<p>Please note that this is experimental, meaning it is subject to change and may not always work as intended. We would love your feedback if you notice some aspects we can improve. The community’s dashboards, shared over the years, have helped shape this design, and we would love to see how it works with a wide variety of your homes. Even if you already have the perfect dashboard built for your home, try it!</p>\n<p><strong>Use <a href=\"https://forms.clickup.com/2533032/f/2d9n8-32191/NK2MUOVKXQVH2L0NHI\">this feedback form</a> to let us know your thoughts!</strong></p>\n<h2>Integration sub-entries</h2>\n<p>Ever wondered why you had to enter your API keys for every AI agent you created, even though they all used the same key? Or why you had to authenticate for every calendar you added, regardless of the fact that they all shared the same account? Or why you couldn’t add MQTT devices from the UI?</p>\n<p>This release solves that with the introduction of integration sub-entries. This allows you to add a sub-entry to an existing <span class='terminology'>integration<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> entry. In practice, this means that your <span class='terminology'>integration<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> entry has your credentials, and all the sub-entries use these credentials. In the sub-entry, you can then configure what should be done with these credentials, such as fetching a specific calendar, adding three AI agents with different prompts using the same OpenAI account, or in the case of MQTT, configuring devices that are connected to your MQTT broker.</p>\n<img class=\"no-shadow\" alt=\"Screenshot showing how you can now add MQTT devices directly through the user interface.\" src=\"/images/blog/2025-07/add-mqtt-device-using-sub-entry.png\" />\n<p>The following <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> now support sub-entries as of this release: <a href=\"/integrations/anthropic\">Anthropic</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/google_generative_ai_conversation\">Google Generative AI</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/mqtt\">MQTT</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/ollama\">Ollama</a>, <a href=\"/integrations/openai_conversation\">OpenAI Conversation</a>, and <a href=\"/integrations/telegram_bot\">Telegram Bot</a>.</p>\n<h2>Integration page gets an overhaul</h2>\n<p>The <span class='terminology'>integration<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> page got a big overhaul!

We’ve added a new full-screen mode for all code editors throughout the interface.</p>\n<p><lite-youtube videoid=\"VfwcYp7zQzo\" videotitle=\"Full screen code editors in Home Assistant\"></lite-youtube></p>\n<p>Whether you’re editing automations, scripts, templates, or any other YAML configuration, you can now expand the code editor to take up your entire screen. This is especially helpful when working with longer configurations or when you need more space to see your code clearly.</p>\n<p>Simply click the maximize button in the top-right corner of any code editor to enter full screen mode. Press the button again to return to the normal view.</p>\n<p>This makes building a more complex and advanced smart home more comfortable and productive, especially on smaller mobile or tablet screens where every pixel of editing space counts!</p>\n<h2>Improved dashboard creation experience</h2>\n<p>The dialog for adding a new dashboard has been redesigned with a cleaner interface that matches recent redesigns we’ve seen to other dialogs.

Read on to see the first <em>Air Purifiers</em> and <em>Vacuums / Cleaning Robots</em>! What’s more, SwitchBot is bringing this first set of devices into the program with multiple connectivity options. Pick from their <a href=\"/integrations/switchbot/\">Bluetooth integration</a>, Matter via a hub, or standalone Matter devices as well. All this gives you even more choice in how you set up your smart home, while providing the best experience with Home Assistant.<!--more--></p>\n<h2>Making the Switch…Bot</h2>\n<p>SwitchBot quickly gained traction in the smart home industry with their original finger bots, which sit over non-smart switches and physically press them down on your behalf. Since then, they’ve expanded to include many other smart home devices like curtain robots, hubs, air purifiers, and cleaning robots. We were excited to see these new products in person at CES earlier this year and meet up with their team.</p>\n<p>SwitchBot even got involved with <a href=\"/blog/2025/06/24/community-day-2025-wrap-up/\">Community Day</a>, hosting a meet-up in Shenzhen, China. We love that the ‘Works with’ partners show that they’re passionate about engaging with our community, taking the partnership much further than just a label on a box.</p>\n<div class=\"alert\">\n    <p>\"At SwitchBot, we're committed to empowering users with seamless and intelligent home automation. By collaborating with Home Assistant's passionate, tech-savvy community, we're able to push boundaries and deliver more integrated, intuitive experiences. Together, we aim to expand what's possible, offering users greater flexibility to connect, control, optimize their homes, and to make it simple.\"</p>\n<em style=\"text-align: right; display: block;\">- Richard Mou - Co-Founder, SwitchBot</em>\n</div>\n<h2>Devices</h2>\n<p>In case you didn’t know, Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box with Home Assistant. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the <a href=\"https://www.openhomefoundation.org/\">Open Home Foundation</a>, and the support of <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers funds this work.</p>\n<p>The SwitchBot team have put special focus on integrating specifically for Home Assistant and have been working hard on their <a href=\"/integrations/switchbot/\">Bluetooth integration</a>. Though the community played a central role in the development of the integration, and SwitchBot is very thankful for this work, they took a more active role in its development.</p>\n<p>One of the terms of the ‘Works with’ program is that Bluetooth devices must connect over an integration that is kept up to a certain code quality (we call this our <a href=\"/docs/quality_scale/\">‘Gold tier’</a> on our quality scale). It also must be maintained by the manufacturers themselves, rather than overly relying on community members to do the hard work. This puts the responsibility on the shoulders of the manufacturers to make sure they’re responding to bugs and keeping the integration up long term. If you’re interested in SwitchBot’s Bluetooth products but your Home Assistant system doesn’t have built-in Bluetooth, the easiest way to connect them is by using a <a href=\"/integrations/bluetooth/#remote-adapters-bluetooth-proxies\">Bluetooth Proxy</a>.</p>\n<p>If you prefer Matter, SwitchBot also has devices that are certified for use with one of their Matter hubs: either the <a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-hub-2\">SwitchBot Hub 2</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-hub-3\">Hub 3</a>. There are also some that can work via Matter-over-WiFi as standalone devices. We are currently testing even more of SwitchBot’s Matter devices for the program.</p>\n<p><strong>Bluetooth</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-lock-ultra\">SwitchBot Lock Ultra</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-air-purifier\">SwitchBot Air Purifier</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-air-purifier-table\">SwitchBot Air Purifier Table</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-water-leak-detector\">SwitchBot Leak Detector</a> - also works using Matter via a hub</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-meter\">SwitchBot Meter</a>  - also works using Matter via a hub </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-meter-pro\">SwitchBot Meter Pro</a> - also works using Matter via a hub</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-meter-pro-co2-monitor\">SwitchBot Meter Pro CO2</a> - also works using Matter via a hub</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-indoor-outdoor-thermo-hygrometer\">SwitchBot Indoor/Outdoor Thermo-Hygrometer</a> - also works using Matter via a hub</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-curtain-3\">SwitchBot Curtain 3</a> - also works using Matter via a hub</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/contact-sensor\">SwitchBot Contact Sensor</a> - also works using Matter via a hub</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-roller-shade\">SwitchBot Roller Shade</a> - also works using Matter via a hub</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-lock-pro\">SwitchBot Lock Pro</a> - also works using Matter via a hub</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Matter-Over-WiFi (standalone, without requiring a hub)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-air-purifier\">SwitchBot Air Purifier</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-air-purifier-table\">SwitchBot Air Purifier Table</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-multitasking-household-robot-k20-pro\">SwitchBot Multitasking Robot K20 + Pro</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> <em>Home Assistant Container does not support Matter, and requires Home Assistant OS.</em></p>\n<h2>A smart home is a clean home</h2>\n<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-06-switchbot/vacuum.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt=\"SwitchBot's cleaning robot with an air purifier\">Eat your heart out Wall-E</p>\n<p>SwitchBot’s K20 is the first cleaning robot in the Works with Home Assistant program as well as the world’s first multi-tasking household robot. This wacky robot can be paired with lots of other items in the range, including the certified air purifiers, to make some really cool Home Assistant use cases. Just imagine, you’re making some delicious dinner, but oh no, you’ve left a pan alone for too long and it starts to smell and burn. You could summon the K20 with an air purifier on top using the Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition. A few moments later, it’s found its way to you and gets started on clearing the air in your kitchen. Plus, as these can both work via Matter, there’s no need for cloud involvement. Some of the items also come with a table top so this device has some great applications for anyone with limited mobility.</p>\n<h2>Bot to the future</h2>\n<p>These devices are the first certified items, but SwitchBot is working to get many more tested and fully feature-rich with Home Assistant. We’re excited to keep expanding this list over time, but if you can’t wait (and this work is only possible with the support of our <a href=\"/cloud/\">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers), you can see the list of the other devices they are working on <a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/pages/home-assistant\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Q: If I have a device that is not listed under ‘Works with Home Assistant’ does this mean it’s not supported?</strong></em></p>\n<p>A: No! It just means that it hasn’t gone through a testing schedule with our team or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program. It might work fine and be added to our testing later down the road. Though it might only have limited functions that are being worked on, or use a connectivity type we don’t currently test for in the program.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: Ok, so what’s the point of the Works with program?</strong></em></p>\n<p>A: It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that the devices must have full functionality within Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud, and will continue to do so long-term.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: How were these devices tested?</strong></em></p>\n<p>A:  The Bluetooth devices in this list were tested using a standard Home Assistant Green Hub, the SwitchBot Bluetooth Integration, a USB Bluetooth adapter, and an ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy. The Matter-over-WiFi devices were also tested with Home Assistant Green and our <a href=\"/integrations/matter/\">certified Matter Integration</a>. If you have another hardware setup or integration, that is often not a problem, but we test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: Will you be adding more SwitchBot devices to the program?</strong></em></p>\n<p>A: Absolutely! SwitchBot has a quickly growing set of product lines that we’re working to certify together, subject to the integrations fully covering all the functions.</p>\n",
