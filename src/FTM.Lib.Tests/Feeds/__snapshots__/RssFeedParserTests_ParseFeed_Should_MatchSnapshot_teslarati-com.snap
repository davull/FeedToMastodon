The Custom Lock Sound, new Light Shows, and even High Fidelity Park Assist have all come in past updates, among many other things. But for 2025, people want even more, and here&#8217;s what we have seen most frequently thus far:</p>\n<h3>More Streaming Platforms</h3>\n<p>This is a personal request of ours, and it&#8217;s something that we feel is long overdue.</p>\n<p>Sure, Netflix, <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-removes-disney-plus-elon-musk-bob-iger-workaround/\">Disney+</a>, and Hulu are all great &#8212; but there&#8217;s a lot of meat left on that bone. HBOMax, Paramount+, and even YouTube TV would be a great option for those of us who have subscriptions and want to watch Live Events while Supercharging or eating in our cars.</p>\n<p>The fact that Tesla has not added more platforms to its in-car Theater in a few years has been, dare I say, disappointing?</p>\n<h3>Full Self-Driving for Europe</h3>\n<p>This is something not even Santa can help with. Although his Elves are known for their high productivity, we&#8217;re not even sure they could convince European regulators to open the door for FSD&#8217;s entrance into the market.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Cmrkvz670L\"><p><a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-deploys-unsupervised-fsd-europe-with-a-twist/\">Tesla deploys Unsupervised FSD in Europe for the first time—with a twist</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\"  title=\"&#8220;Tesla deploys Unsupervised FSD in Europe for the first time—with a twist&#8221; &#8212; TESLARATI\" src=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-deploys-unsupervised-fsd-europe-with-a-twist/embed/#?secret=SapOaxX1wN#?secret=Cmrkvz670L\" data-secret=\"Cmrkvz670L\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>FSD is definitely capable of handling European driving conditions, but regulators are truly dragging their feet through the mud with the approval process. Tesla has tested FSD in several countries in Europe, but nothing has been set in stone yet.</p>\n<h3>Deeper Grok Integration</h3>\n<p>Many owners have said something about how Grok is truly not super in-tune with the vehicles. This is something any owner will experience.</p>\n<p>It seems <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-wont-implement-strange-grok-character-musk-dispels-rumor/\">Grok should be capable of handling all in-car requests</a>; everything from changing the A/C to a specific temperature to adding a stop within the Navigation should be handled by Grok.</p>\n<p>Instead, Grok cannot handle those things currently. You have to speak to the car itself using the microphone button on the steering wheel.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, some vehicles already have the Grok logo replacing the microphone. It is likely the most realistic request of all.</p>\n<h3>&#8216;Learn&#8217; Mode for Full Self-Driving Arrival Options</h3>\n<p>Although it is great for public destinations, FSD still does not allow you to choose a set parking spot at your residence. It also does not allow you to choose preferences for parking in large parking lots.</p>\n<p>Renters, and even those who live in purchased townhomes, often have assigned parking spots. <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-full-self-driving-supervised-v14-1-7-real-world-drive-review-video/\">Full Self-Driving v14 has done a great job of doing half the work</a>, but there have been too many times when I&#8217;ve arrived home, the car pulls me into a spot, and I&#8217;m forced to manually back out and park in my assigned space.</p>\n<p>Many people also do not like to park toward the entrance of a store, me included. Parking away from the front of a store eliminates parking congestion and usually is a safer bet for your vehicle to keep from being dinged by careless drivers who swing their doors open.</p>\n<h3>Navigation Adjustments</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you don&#8217;t want to turn left on the street the navigation chooses. Maybe you want to go a block down and check out that new Portuguese restaurant that just opened on the way to your next destination.</p>\n<p>This is only possible currently by inputting a waypoint that would take you that way. Instead, the center screen could be opened, and the driver should be able to select an alternative route by simply touching a street they&#8217;d rather travel on.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-holiday-update-incoming-wishlist-is-merry-bright/\">Tesla Holiday Update is incoming, and the wishlist is Merry and Bright</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com\">TESLARATI</a>.</p>\n",

      "Content": "\n<p>Tesla received another round of bullish analyst updates this week, led by Stifel, raising its price target to $508 from $483 while reaffirming a “Buy” rating. The firm cited meaningful progress in Tesla’s robotaxi roadmap, ongoing Full Self-Driving enhancements, and the company’s long-term growth initiatives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Robotaxi rollout, FSD updates, and new affordable cars</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stifel expects Tesla’s robotaxi fleet to expand into 8–10 major metropolitan areas by the end of 2025, including Austin, where early deployments without safety drivers are targeted before year-end. Additional markets under evaluation include Nevada, Florida, and Arizona, as noted in an <em><a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/tesla-stock-price-target-raised-to-508-from-483-at-stifel-on-robotaxi-progress-93CH-4361441\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Investing.com</a></em> report. The firm also highlighted strong early <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-shareholders-approve-elon-musks-2025-ceo-performance-award/\">performance</a> for FSD Version 14, with upcoming releases adding new “reasoning capabilities” designed to improve complex decision-making using full 360-degree vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla has also taken steps to offset the loss of U.S. EV tax credits by launching the Model Y Standard and Model 3 Standard at $39,990 and $36,990, Stifel noted. Both vehicles deliver more than 300 miles of range and are positioned to sustain demand despite shifting incentives. Stifel raised its EBITDA forecasts to $14.9 billion for 2025 and $19.5 billion for 2026, assigning partial valuation weightings to Tesla’s FSD, robotaxi, and Optimus initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>TD Cowen also places an optimistic price target</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>TD Cowen <a href=\"https://somoshermanos.mx/td-cowen-maintains-buy-rating-on-tesla-tsla-with-509-price-target-after-austin-mobility-tour/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reiterated</a> its Buy rating with a $509 price target after a research tour of Giga Texas, citing production scale and operational execution as key strengths. The firm posted its optimistic price target following a recent Mobility Bus tour in Austin. The tour included a visit to Giga Texas, which offered fresh insights into the company’s operations and prospects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional analyst movements include Truist Securities maintaining its Hold rating following shareholder approval of Elon Musk’s compensation plan, viewing the vote as reducing leadership uncertainty.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@teslarati/video/7573362128556510477\" data-video-id=\"7573362128556510477\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\" > <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@teslarati\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@teslarati?refer=embed\">@teslarati</a> Tesla Full Self-Driving yields for pedestrians while human drivers do not…the future is here! <a title=\"tesla\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tesla?refer=embed\">#tesla</a> <a title=\"teslafsd\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/teslafsd?refer=embed\">#teslafsd</a> <a title=\"fullselfdriving\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fullselfdriving?refer=embed\">#fullselfdriving</a> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ 2 Little 2 Late - Levi &#38; Mario\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/2-Little-2-Late-7544043542228224016?refer=embed\">♬ 2 Little 2 Late &#8211; Levi &#38; Mario</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\"></script>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-wins-508-price-target-stifel-robotaxi-rollout-gains-speed/\">Tesla wins $508 price target from Stifel as Robotaxi rollout gains speed</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com\">TESLARATI</a>.</p>\n",

The move makes Tesla Nomura’s 10th-largest holding at about 1% of its entire portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Institutional investors and TSLA</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nomura’s filing was released alongside several other fund updates. Brighton Jones LLC boosted its holdings by 11.8%, as noted in a <em><a href=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/filing-nomura-asset-management-co-ltd-acquires-47674-shares-of-tesla-inc-tsla-2025-11-17/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MarketBeat</a></em> report, and Revolve Wealth Partners lifted its TSLA position by 21.2%.

About 66% of all outstanding Tesla shares are now owned by institutional investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The buying comes shortly after Tesla reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, posting $0.50 per share compared with the $0.48 consensus. Revenue reached $28.10 billion, topping Wall Street’s $24.98 billion estimate. Despite the earnings beat, Tesla continues to trade at a steep premium relative to peers, with a market cap hovering around $1.34 trillion and a price-to-earnings ratio near 270.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Recent insider sales</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Tesla insiders have sold stock as of late. CFO Vaibhav Taneja sold 2,606 shares in early September for just over $918,000, reducing his personal stake by about 21%. Director James R. Murdoch executed a far larger sale, offloading 120,000 shares for roughly $42 million and trimming his holdings by nearly 15%. Over the past three months, Tesla insiders have collectively sold 202,606 shares valued at approximately $75.6 million, as per SEC disclosures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla is currently entering its next phase of growth, and if it is successful, it could very well become the world’s <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-shareholders-approve-elon-musks-2025-ceo-performance-award/\">most valuable company</a> as a result.

The publication also claimed that Tesla has been reducing its reliance on China-based suppliers since the pandemic disrupted supply chains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has quietly increased North American sourcing over the past two years as tariff concerns have intensified. If accurate, Tesla would likely end up with vehicles that are even more locally sourced than they are today. It would remain to be seen, however, if a change in suppliers for its <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-leans-on-american-made-pedigree/\">US-made vehicles</a> would result in price adjustments for cars like the Model 3 and Model Y.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Industry-wide reassessments</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla is not alone in reevaluating its dependence on China. Auto executives across the automotive industry have been in rapid-response mode amid shifting trade policies, chip supply anxiety, and concerns over rare-earth materials. Fluctuating tariffs between the United States and China during President Donald Trump’s current term have made pricing strategies quite unpredictable as well, as noted in a <em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-requires-suppliers-avoid-china-made-parts-us-cars-wsj-reports-2025-11-15/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reuters</a></em> report.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>General Motors this week issued a similar directive to thousands of suppliers, instructing them to remove China-origin components from their supply chains.

Some believe it might have to do with the EV tax credit, or rather, <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-makes-first-move-to-counter-loss-of-7500-ev-tax-credit/\">the loss of it</a>.</p>\n<p>Owners are more interested in why Tesla is doing this now, especially considering that so many have been outspoken about the fact that they would not use it in favor of the company&#8217;s user interface (UI), which is extremely well done.</p>\n<p>After <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-reportedly-testing-apple-carplay-integration-report/\">Tesla was working on Apple CarPlay integration</a>, the reactions immediately started pouring in. From my perspective, having used both Apple CarPlay in two previous vehicles and going to Tesla&#8217;s in-house UI in my Model Y, both platforms definitely have their advantages.</p>\n<p>However, Tesla&#8217;s UI just works with its vehicles, as it is intuitive and well-engineered for its cars specifically. <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-apple-carplay-hack-updated-video/\">Apple CarPlay was always good</a>, but it was buggy at times, which could be attributed to the vehicle and not the software, and not as user-friendly, but that is subjective.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, upon the release of <em>Bloomberg&#8217;s</em> report, people immediately challenged the need for it:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Everyone thinks they need it. I would think that too if I didn’t know how good Tesla’s interface was. CarPlay is a crappy layer on top of crappy info-navs, and people think it’s an imperative because it provides a level of consistency from car to car. They have no clue how much…</p>\n<p>— Rich Stafford (@r26174_rich) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/r26174_rich/status/1989151816458576319?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">How can it not be when the best engineers choose Tesla over Apple and Tesla’s core focus is auto vs Apple being mobile. It’s what Tesla does every day. It’s a side project for Apple. Still Apple is much better than any other auto OEM who attract lesser talent and make digital…</p>\n<p>— Emu (@confessedemu) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/confessedemu/status/1989338317691945453?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Some fans proposed an interesting point: What if Tesla is using CarPlay as a counter to losing the $7,500 EV tax credit? Perhaps it is an interesting way to attract customers who have not owned a Tesla before but are more interested in having a vehicle equipped with CarPlay?</p>\n<p>&#8220;100%. It’s needed for sales because for many prospective buyers, CarPlay is a nonnegotiable must-have. If they knew how good the Tesla UI is, they wouldn’t think they need CarPlay,&#8221; one owner said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-benefits-new-incentive-program-active-after-tax-credit-texas/\">Tesla has made a handful of moves</a> to attract people to its cars after losing the tax credit. This could be a small but potentially mighty strategy that will pull some carbuyers to Tesla, especially now that the Apple CarPlay box is checked.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@teslarati/video/7572612964071558430\" data-video-id=\"7572612964071558430\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\" >\n<section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@teslarati\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@teslarati?refer=embed\">@teslarati</a> :rotating_light: This is why you need to use off-peak rates at Tesla Superchargers! <a title=\"tesla\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tesla?refer=embed\">#tesla</a> <a title=\"evcharging\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/evcharging?refer=embed\">#evcharging</a> <a title=\"fyp\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed\">#fyp</a> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ Blue Moon - Muspace Lofi\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/Blue-Moon-7142926879102601217?refer=embed\">♬ Blue Moon &#8211; Muspace Lofi</a> </section>\n</blockquote>\n<p> <script async src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-owners-propose-interesting-theory-apply-carplay-ev-tax-credit/\">Tesla owners propose interesting theory about Apple CarPlay and EV tax credit</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com\">TESLARATI</a>.</p>\n",
