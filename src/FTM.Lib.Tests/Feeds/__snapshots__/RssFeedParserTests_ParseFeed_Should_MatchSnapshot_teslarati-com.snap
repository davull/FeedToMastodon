      "Content": "<p>Tesla Robotaxi just got a big benefit from the U.S. Government, as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is looking to ease some rules and streamline the application process that could hinder the development and licensing of autonomous vehicles.</p>\n<p>Tesla <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-reveals-date-tesla-robotaxis-first-rides-open-public/\">is set to launch its Robotaxi platform in the coming days or weeks,</a> but regulation on autonomous vehicles is incredibly slim, so automakers are left in a strange limbo as permissions to operate are usually up to local jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>The NHTSA still has the ultimate say, but it is now adopting a new strategy that will see companies gain an exemption from federal safety standards and <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-full-self-driving-european-launch-frustrations-revealed-elon-musk/\">streamline the entire application process</a>.</p>\n<p>The agency is authorized to grant exemptions to permit manufacturers to produce vehicles over a two or three-year period that might not comply with certain Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). Robotaxi, for example, will eventually not have a steering wheel or pedals, through the Cybercab that Tesla unveiled last October.</p>\n<p>The exemption program the NHTSA announced today would be possible through Part 555 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;NHTSA may grant a Part 555 exemption if at least one of four bases listed in the statute is met and NHTSA determines that the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the Safety Act. The statute also authorizes NHTSA to subject an exemption to terms the agency deems appropriate and requires that NHTSA publish notice of the application and provide an opportunity to comment.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>The rapid and non-stop innovation that is being performed is tough to keep up with from a legal standpoint. The NHTSA recognizes this and says current legislation is appropriate for traditional vehicles, but not for the <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-driverless-robotaxi-austin-tx-first-look/\">self-driving cars companies are producing now</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;The current Part 555 process was designed for traditional vehicles. As currently applied, this process is not well suited for processing exemptions involving ADS-equipped vehicles in a timely manner or overseeing the unique complexities involving their operations. This has resulted in long processing times for applications for ADS-equipped vehicles. NHTSA must improve its Part 555 processing times substantially to keep pace with the rapid innovation of the ADS industry and to ensure that exemptions remain effective tools for nurturing groundbreaking safety technologies.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Now, the NHTSA will be &#8220;enhancing application instructions&#8221; to help manufacturers understand the requirements involved in the application process. This will streamline the entire process by &#8220;reducing the need for NHTSA to request additional information from the manufacturer,&#8221; the agency says.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"xdTUHfo0yj\"><p><a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-driverless-robotaxi-austin-tx-first-look/\">First Tesla driverless robotaxi spotted in the wild in Austin, TX</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\"  title=\"&#8220;First Tesla driverless robotaxi spotted in the wild in Austin, TX&#8221; &#8212; TESLARATI\" src=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-driverless-robotaxi-austin-tx-first-look/embed/#?secret=ZMNFL305g7#?secret=xdTUHfo0yj\" data-secret=\"xdTUHfo0yj\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Next, the NHTSA is going to have a more flexible approach to evaluating exemptions for ADS-equipped vehicles:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;To build flexibility into the Part 555 process while also accounting for the unique aspects of those exemptions, NHTSA intends to develop terms that could be included in Part 555 exemption grants, when appropriate, to condition operations of exempted ADS-equipped vehicles on enhanced and continuing oversight from NHTSA. NHTSA would expect to administer this enhanced oversight through letters, which could be updated over time, mirroring real-world ADS development. This will enable NHTSA to focus its initial review during the application stage and align the Part 555 oversight approach more closely to exemptions administered under NHTSA’s Automated Vehicle Exemption Program (AVEP), which have proven effective for ADS.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>This will benefit any company making autonomous vehicles, but it will especially benefit Tesla in the short-term as it is readying for the launch of Robotaxi.</p>\n<p>Tesla is trading up 1.89 percent at the time of publication.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;\"><a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View Part 555 Letter June 2025 on Scribd\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/875707366/Part-555-Letter-June-2025#from_embed\">Part 555 Letter June 2025</a> by <a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View Joey Klender's profile on Scribd\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/user/509367912/Joey-Klender#from_embed\">Joey Klender</a> on Scribd</p>\n<p><iframe id=\"doc_15356\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Part 555 Letter June 2025\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/875707366/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-6Hl4WfZMbkw37OwlGYWW\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7729220222793488\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-robotaxi-big-benefit-u-s-government-nhtsa-rules-autonomous-vehicles/\">Tesla Robotaxi just got a big benefit from the U.S. government</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com\">TESLARATI</a>.</p>\n",

The two additional seats were truly a tight fit for anyone, even kids, as the space for a third row was extremely limited in the Model Y.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"HH0McTKbp0\"><p><a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-y-third-row-seats-first-review/\">Tesla Model Y third-row seats first impressions shared by EV owner</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\"  title=\"&#8220;Tesla Model Y third-row seats first impressions shared by EV owner&#8221; &#8212; TESLARATI\" src=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-y-third-row-seats-first-review/embed/#?secret=FwDj0J6hNj#?secret=HH0McTKbp0\" data-secret=\"HH0McTKbp0\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Eventually, <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-y-seven-seat-option/\">Tesla started building the seven-seater with forward-facing seats</a> and very tight legroom dimensions. It was beneficial for some, but many still considered the arrangement to be too confined for their needs.</p>\n<p>The company confirmed earlier this year in an interview with Jay Leno <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-confirms-highly-requested-seating-option-for-new-model-y/\">that the car would get other configurations</a>, including Rear-Wheel-Drive, which has already launched, a Performance trim, which has been spotted with bumper covers several times this year, and a seven-seat version:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f6a8.png\" alt=\"🚨\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />CONFIRMED: Tesla will launch the new Model Y 7-Seater and new Model Y Performance later this year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://t.co/AA5ZPa7K4q\">pic.twitter.com/AA5ZPa7K4q</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/zkphg11LsS\">https://t.co/zkphg11LsS</a></p>\n<p>— TESLARATI (@Teslarati) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Teslarati/status/1889009709698490858?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>The new seven-seater could be coming soon as well, according to a recent email Tesla sent to customers and fans.

Nevertheless, the new Model Y came with quite a few improvements, including suspension changes, acoustic-lined glass for a better cabin experience, and a front and rear bumper redesign, among other things.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt it will be a better car than the legacy version.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-teases-new-model-y-seating-option-potentially-coming-soon/\">Tesla teases new Model Y seating option potentially coming soon</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com\">TESLARATI</a>.</p>\n",

      "Content": "\n<p>The Tesla Lathrop Megafactory recently achieved a new milestone. As per the <a href=\"https://x.com/Tesla_Megapack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">official Tesla Megapack account</a> on X, the Lathrop Megafactory has produced its 15,000th Megapack 2 XL battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">15,000 Megapack Batteries</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla celebrated the milestone with a photo of the Lathrop Megafactory team posing with a freshly produced Megapack battery. To commemorate the event, the team held balloons that spelled out &#8220;15,000&#8221; as they posed for the photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tesla Megapack is the backbone of Tesla Energy&#8217;s battery deployments. Designed for grid-scale applications, each Megapack offers <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/megapack/design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">3.9 MWh of energy and 1.9 MW of power</a>. The battery is extremely scalable, making it perfect for massive energy storage projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">https://twitter.com/Tesla_Megapack/status/1932578971700638203</div>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More Megafactories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lathrop Megafactory is Tesla&#8217;s first dedicated facility for its flagship battery storage system. It currently stands as the <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/megafactory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">largest utility-scale battery factory</a> in North America. The facility is capable of producing 10,000 Megapack batteries every year, equal to 40 GWh of clean energy storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the success of the Megapack, Tesla has <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-shanghai-megafactory-officially-launches-operations/\">expanded its energy business</a> by building and launching the Shanghai Megafactory, which is also expected to produce 40 GWh of energy storage per year. The ramp of the Shanghai Megafactory is quite impressive, with Tesla noting in its <a href=\"https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/IR/TSLA-Q1-2025-Update.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Q1 2025 Update Letter</a> that the <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-shanghai-megafactory-exports-megapacks-australia/\">Shanghai Megafactory</a> managed to produce over 100 Megapack batteries in the first quarter alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tesla Energy&#8217;s Potential</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During the first quarter earnings call, CEO Elon Musk stated that the Megapack is extremely valuable to the energy industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Megapack enables utility companies to output far more total energy than would otherwise be the case… This is a massive unlock on total energy output of any given grid over the course of a year. And utility companies are beginning to realize this and are buying in our Megapacks at scale,&#8221; Musk said.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-lathrop-megafactory-celebrates-15k-megapack-milestone/\">Tesla Lathrop Megafactory celebrates massive Megapack battery milestone</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com\">TESLARATI</a>.</p>\n",
