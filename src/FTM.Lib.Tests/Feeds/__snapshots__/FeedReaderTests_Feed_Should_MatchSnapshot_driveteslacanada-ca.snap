      "Content": "\n<p class=\"p1\">A Tesla <a href=\"http://driveteslacanada.ca/supercharger\">Supercharger</a> station located at Woodgrove Centre in Nanaimo, British Columbia, is temporarily closed after two charging stalls were damaged by what appears to be a deliberately set fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two stalls were damaged in the early hours of Saturday, March 15, 2025, with the fire affecting two stalls located near a children’s daycare facility. Fortunately, damage was limited to the two Supercharger stalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By Saturday afternoon, Tesla technicians were also on scene to begin repairs. According to Richard, who spoke with the Tesla employee, the repairs should be completed and the station back up and running before the end of the weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Drive Tesla</em> has reached out to the local RCMP detachment on the status of their investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://twitter.com/driveteslaca/status/1901116546384359757?s=46&#038;t=4qIejx9C8-y8BPcKtu0iIw\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\">This event in Nanaimo is part of a troubling pattern of recent attacks on Tesla’s charging infrastructure. In Littleton, Massachusetts, a similar incident occurred earlier this month where <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-superchargers-and-vehicles-targeted-in-suspected-arson-attacks/\">seven Supercharger stalls were deliberately set on fire</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\">In response to the Littleton arson, Tesla demonstrated remarkable efficiency by restoring the damaged Supercharger stations to full functionality in under 48 hours.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\">In Loveland, Colorado, a 42-year-old transgender woman, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/suspect-arrested-in-tesla-vandalism-case-in-colorado/\">Lucy Grace Nelson, was arrested for allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails</a> at a Tesla store and defacing vehicles with offensive graffiti. Nelson was charged with federal malicious destruction and released on a $100,000 bond.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Similarly, in North Charleston, South Carolina, a man set fire to three Tesla chargers using incendiary devices. During the attack, the suspect accidentally set his own clothes on fire before fleeing the scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\">These incidents are part of a broader wave of anti-Tesla sentiment, which has escalated into vandalism and arson across various locations. Protests have not only targeted Tesla’s infrastructure but have also extended to showrooms and vehicles, with reports of graffiti, property damage, and other forms of vandalism.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-supercharger-set-on-fire-in-nanaimo-bc/\">Tesla Supercharger Set On Fire in Nanaimo, BC</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

In a statement to <em>CBC</em>, Tyler Krause from SaskEV had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>While I agree that, at some point, an EV tax is necessary to deal with road maintenance costs, we&#8217;re not at that point yet. We just don&#8217;t have enough EVs to justify this kind of tax.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Saskatchewan is not a hotbed for EVs, with the province accounting for only 0.4% of overall EV sales in Q4 2024.

According to Energy Minister Adrian Dix, the decision aligns with the government’s shifting fiscal priorities. The change takes effect on May 1, 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This makes sense now in terms of the priorities people have right now, the tariffs, and trying to prepare for that,” Dix stated. The Ministry of Finance estimates that ending the exemption early will save the province $48 million in the 2025/26 budget cycle and $54 million in 2026/27.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to remove the exemption has drawn criticism from industry stakeholders who argue it could dissuade potential buyers from choosing EVs, particularly in the wake of the federal government’s recent suspension of its own EV rebate program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the loss of the used EV tax exemption will make used electric cars less attractive, B.C. continues to offer income-based rebates on new EV purchases. Whether these incentives will be enough to maintain the province’s rapid adoption of EVs remains to be seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/b-c-excludes-tesla-from-cleanbc-rebates-despite-allowing-other-u-s-brands/\">province has since also excluded Tesla products</a>, like the Wall Connector and Powerwall and inverters from BC Hydro and CleanBC rebate program. When asked for the rationale behind the decision to exclude Tesla and no other U.S.-based companies, Premier David Eby said, &#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s just for Tesla and it&#8217;s because of Elon Musk.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/b-c-government-ends-pst-exemption-for-used-evs-two-years-ahead-of-schedule/\">B.C.

      "Content": "\n<p><a href=\"http://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/tesla\">Tesla </a>has written a letter outlining their concerns to the White House over potential retaliatory tariffs that could significantly impact its business and the broader U.S. auto industry. In the unsigned letter to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, the automaker warned that escalating trade policies could trigger countermeasures from other nations, making American-made vehicles less competitive on the global stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a copy of the letter, dated March 11, 2025 and posted to USTR Comments Portal which can you read in full below, Tesla urges the White House to adopt a measured approach that mitigates unintended consequences for U.S. companies. The automaker called for a “phased approach” that allows manufacturers to adjust to new trade policies while preserving competitiveness in international markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company also highlighted that despite its &#8220;aggressive localization of the supply chain,&#8221; sourcing some critical components domestically remains a challenge. Tesla noted that certain raw materials—such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel—are scarce within the U.S. and difficult to obtain without relying on global supply chains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imposing tariffs on these materials, the company warned, could drive up manufacturing costs and hinder the ability of American automakers to remain competitive internationally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite having the <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-model-y-tops-2024-american-made-index-for-third-consecutive-year/\">most American-made cars on the market</a>, the prospect of a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico is still a concern for Tesla. Tesla’s supply chain, like that of many other car manufacturers, is heavily reliant on components sourced from these two countries. A sudden cost increase in these parts could force Tesla to either raise vehicle prices or absorb financial losses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read Tesla&#8217;s full letter below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><object class=\"wp-block-file__embed\" data=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USTR-2025-0001-00111195-CAT-5983-Public-Document.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" style=\"width:100%;height:600px\" aria-label=\"Embed of USTR-2025-0001-00111195-CAT-5983-Public-Document.\"></object><a id=\"wp-block-file--media-8f2ee0c1-2885-4392-a530-2f76f2aa19a4\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USTR-2025-0001-00111195-CAT-5983-Public-Document.pdf\">USTR-2025-0001-00111195-CAT-5983-Public-Document</a><a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USTR-2025-0001-00111195-CAT-5983-Public-Document.pdf\" class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download aria-describedby=\"wp-block-file--media-8f2ee0c1-2885-4392-a530-2f76f2aa19a4\">Download</a></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-sends-letter-to-white-house-warning-of-impacts-of-retaliatory-tariffs/\">Tesla sends letter to White House warning of impacts of retaliatory tariffs</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

      "Content": "\n<p>Fisker Ocean owners have been stuck in a nightmare ever since<a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/bankruptcy-court-judge-orders-fisker-to-pay-ocean-recall-costs/\"> Fisker declared bankruptcy in 2024</a>, leaving them with vehicles that rapidly depreciated and lacked factory support. However, a new buyback program from Rivian and JPMorgan Chase is now providing a way out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to letters received by some Fisker Ocean owners and posted online, Rivian, in partnership with Chase Bank, is extending an offer that could help them recover significant value from their vehicles. The deal provides three main options: <em>(via <a href=\"https://www.carscoops.com/2025/03/rivian-and-chase-offer-buyback-rescue-to-fisker-ocean-owners/\">Carscoops</a>)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li>Selling their Fisker directly to Rivian.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trading it in for credit toward a new Rivian R1S or R1T.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Selling inoperable vehicles to Chase for a fixed price.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>According to reports, Rivian and Chase are determining buyback values based on the original purchase price, subtracting a usage deduction. Some owners have already received offers exceeding US$36,000—far more than they would likely get on the open market, where Fisker Oceans have been selling for as little as US$10,000. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The buyback program offers an additional incentive of up to US$6,000 in savings on long-range versions of Rivian’s R1S and R1T models.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"reddit-embed-bq\" style=\"height:500px\" data-embed-height=\"740\"><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fisker/comments/1j8ss0c/anyone_else_get_this_in_the_mail/\">Anyone else get this in the mail.</a><br> by<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sit11birth/\">u/sit11birth</a> in<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fisker/\">Fisker</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"UTF-8\"></script>\n\n\n\n<p>While this program is a welcome relief for many, it does have its limitations. The deal is mainly available to Fisker owners who financed their purchase through Chase or are part of the Hagens Berman class action lawsuit against Fisker. Owners who have already sold their Oceans at a loss, hoping to escape their financial burden, are unfortunately left out of this program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, while the buyback price offers some relief, it does not make up for the full amount many owners originally paid—especially those who purchased higher-end trims with prices exceeding $60,000. However, given the dire resale market for Fisker vehicles, most affected owners see this as the best offer they will likely receive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Rivian, this move is not just about goodwill; it’s a strategic marketing play. By targeting Fisker owners—many of whom remain committed to the EV market but feel betrayed by Fisker—Rivian is positioning itself as a reliable alternative. Unlike Fisker, Rivian has successfully scaled production, built a strong brand, and expanded its product offerings.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/rivian-and-chase-offer-fisker-ocean-owners-buyback-program/\">Rivian and Chase Offer Fisker Ocean Owners Buyback Program</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

      "Content": "\n<p>British Columbia has announced that Tesla’s products—including its <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-giga-nevada-produces-1000-powerwalls-in-a-single-day/\">Powerwall </a>home battery, inverters, and electric vehicle (EV) chargers—will no longer be eligible for rebates under the CleanBC and BC Hydro programs. The province claims this move is part of an effort to support Canadian-made products and reduce reliance on American imports. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the revised list of eligible products still includes American-made brands, raising questions about the policy’s consistency and the true motivation behind Tesla’s exclusion.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to an update posted to the BC Hydro website, the exclusion of Tesla is meant to &#8220;preference Canadian goods&#8221; and &#8220;exclude, where practicable, U.S.-produced goods.&#8221; But a quick look at the updated <a href=\"https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebate-eligible-chargers.html\">list </a>of eligible products reveals that almost all of the alternatives that remain eligible for rebates are U.S.-based. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, of the companies still listed as eligible, only four are Canadian (FLO, Grizzl-E, Hypercharge, Sun Country Highway), while a whopping 73, or 94.8% of the companies on the list, are from the U.S., according to a review by Grok.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We have reached out to BC Hydro for clarification on why Tesla appears to be the only U.S. company excluded under these new rules, but have not received a reply by the time of publication. We will update this article when we receive a reply.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-if-i-already-purchased-a-tesla-product\">What If I Already Purchased a Tesla Product?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the program, British Columbians can receive rebates covering up to 50% of the cost of a Level 2 EV charger, like a Tesla <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-wall-connector-hacked-at-pwn2own-automotive-2025/\">Wall Connector</a> (until this change), up to a maximum of $350. Homeowners installing energy storage solutions, like the Tesla <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-ramps-powerwall-production-by-50-in-just-three-months/\">Powerwall </a>(until this change), have also benefited from financial incentives to offset the cost of backup power. However, as of March 12, 2025, Tesla products will no longer be eligible for these rebates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who already purchased a Tesla Wall Connector or Powerwall or received pre-approval before March 12, rebates will still be processed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This move is part of a broader pattern of Tesla being unfairly targeted in Canada. In recent months there have been calls for the <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/jagmeet-singh-calls-for-100-tariff-on-tesla-while-pushing-10000-rebate-for-canadian-made-evs/\">government to impose 100% tariffs</a> on Tesla vehicles sold in Canada, with some even going so far as to say there should be an all-out ban on Tesla. In Toronto, Mayor Olivia Chow excluded Tesla from the taxi grant program<a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/toronto-drops-tesla-from-taxi-grant-program-as-deputy-mayor-calls-to-shut-down-tesla-yorkdale/\">Toronto Drops Tesla from Taxi Grant Program as Deputy Mayor Calls to Shut Down Tesla Yorkdale</a>, specifically targeting the brand by saying, “People can still continue to buy electric vehicles, just not Tesla.

      "Content": "\n<p><a href=\"http://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/rivian\">Rivian </a>has launched its advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), rolling out its new Enhanced Highway Assist feature, along with several other new features. Introduced through software update 2025.06, the hands-free driving system is currently only available for second-generation R1S and R1T vehicle, and only works on certain highways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rivian’s Autonomy Platform was developed in-house, and relies on three key components: a sensor suite using both radar and vision, an onboard compute module, and machine learning algorithms that process environmental data in real-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sensor suite includes 11 cameras and five radars, providing a 360-degree view of the vehicle’s surroundings. Rivian claims its cameras have the highest resolution of any North American vehicle, while its overlapping radars enhance visibility in poor conditions such as fog, darkness, or glare. This data is processed by an onboard compute module capable of handling over 200 trillion operations per second, allowing the platform’s machine learning models to interpret sensor data and improve decision-making in detecting obstacles and navigating traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video autoplay controls loop src=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/crf20.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Rivian, Enhanced Highway Assist allows owners to take their hands off the wheel while driving, provided they remain attentive to the road. At launch, the feature is available on 135,000 miles (217,000km) of highways across Canada and the U.S., Rivian&#8217;s development roadmap includes further advancements, with expansions planned over the next year including off-highway roads, and also <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/rivian-to-launch-hands-free-driving-in-2025-eyes-off-autonomy-by-2026/\">hands-off, eyes-off capabilities</a> expected to debut in controlled conditions in 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside Enhanced Highway Assist, Rivian has introduced several additional improvements in its latest software update, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/rivian-to-introduce-ota-upgrades-to-increase-range-and-performance/\">which we covered last week</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rally Mode: Designed for performance dual-motor vehicles, this mode improves throttle response and steering for better handling on dirt, ice, and other challenging surfaces.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Performance Upgrade: Available as an OTA software update for C$7,200 (US$5,000), this upgrade boosts performance to 665 horsepower and 829 lb-ft of torque, unlocking three new driving modes: Sport, Rally, and Soft Sand.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Convenience Enhancements: New quality-of-life features include tilt-down side mirrors when reversing, remote charge port door closure, and the “Go Chime” alert, which notifies drivers when the vehicle ahead has started moving.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ignition-responsive-embed\"><iframe title=\"The Road Ahead | Autonomy | Rivian\" width=\"975\" height=\"548\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K-oBUS8HH-g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/rivian-brings-hands-free-driving-and-more-in-latest-software-update/\">Rivian brings hands-free driving and more in latest software update</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",

While the two companies have signed an agreement, the official rollout of Starlink services in India is <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/regulatory-hurdles-delay-starlinks-entry-into-india/\">still pending regulatory approvals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a joint statement released on Tuesday, the partnership will see Airtel distribute Starlink equipment through its retail network. The partnership will also explore enterprise solutions for businesses operating in remote areas. Additionally, both companies are committed to expanding internet access in underserved communities, including rural schools and healthcare centers, to promote digital inclusion. The partnership will further examine how Starlink’s satellite infrastructure can complement Airtel’s existing network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Working with SpaceX to offer Starlink to Airtel customers in India is a significant milestone and further demonstrates our commitment to next-generation satellite connectivity,&#8221; said Gopal Vittal, Managing Director and Vice Chairman of Bharti Airtel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gwynne Shotwell, President of SpaceX, echoed this sentiment, saying, &#8220;We are excited to work with Airtel and unlock the transformative impact Starlink can bring to the people of India.&#8221; She highlighted Airtel&#8217;s pivotal role in India&#8217;s telecom sector and emphasized the synergy between the two companies in enhancing connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starlink&#8217;s journey into the Indian market has been met with multiple regulatory hurdles. In late 2021, the company faced scrutiny for accepting pre-orders without securing the necessary licenses, leading to government <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/spacex/spacex-refunds-starlink-pre-orders-india/\">ordering SpaceX to halt sales and refund deposits</a>. At that time, Starlink had amassed over 5,000 pre-orders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SpaceX and Airtel partnership announcement comes after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Elon Musk during his visit to the U.S. last month. Since that meeting, Tesla has also signaled its long-awaited entry into India. The company has already <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-announces-hiring-day-in-india-as-mumbai-showroom-lease-secured/\">secured a lease for their first showroom in Mumbai, and plans to host a hiring day soon</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/airtel-partners-with-spacex-to-bring-starlink-to-india-pending-regulatory-approval/\">Airtel partners with SpaceX to bring Starlink to India, pending regulatory approval</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca\">Drive Tesla</a>.</p>\n",
