<p>Dr. Jenny Radesky, a developmental pediatrician who authored the American Academy of Pediatrics screen time guidelines for children ages zero to five, says there are thoughtful strategies for avoiding or managing these conflicts. (The <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/Media/Pages/tech-gift-guide-tips-for-parents-introducing-new-technology-at-home.aspx" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AAP has its own set of related tips</a> for parents.) </p><p>She recommends critically evaluating the tech you plan to gift, considering any alternatives as necessary, and then preparing to talk to your child about how they'll use it. </p><p>"It's good to have fun with your kids and enjoy their happiness," Radesky says. "But there's also really big differences in the design of different technologies that make them more of a headache for parents..." </p><p>And no one wants a headache after weeks of planning and prepping for holiday gift-giving. </p><p>Whether you've already purchased a tech device for your child, or plan to do so, here are five questions to ask yourself before you gift it: </p><h2>Is the technology well-known? </h2><p>Radesky says that buying your child a gaming console with years of user experience behind it is a different situation than purchasing a new AI-robot companion for your child (yes, such a thing exists).  </p><p>With a Nintendo Switch or Sony PlayStation, you can scour expert reviews for pros and cons, talk to parents who own the console, and read related media coverage about their safety practices and parental controls. The same won't be true of new and emerging products; you'll have less information to make an informed decision, compared to other established tech products. </p><p>That said, trust your gut if you research a product that's been on the market for years and develop concerns that it's not right for you or your family.</p><h2>Is it <em>really </em>educational? </h2><p>Radesky says that children's tech toys and devices often claim, without evidence, that they're educational. The appealing marketing strategy can deceive parents into purchasing disappointing products. </p><p>There are devices and apps with simplistic designs and distracting ads, for example. And some products say they'll help your child with a fundamental skill, like reading, but actually have a narrow scope, such as practicing the alphabet. </p><p>Radesky recommends that parents think about whether a so-called educational product is indeed better than a child's own imaginative play, which can help them develop critical skills. </p><p>"Open-ended and pretend play is a really important process for kids to develop mental flexibility, their attention span, and their ability to do storytelling in their heads," Radesky says. </p><p>She also notes that educational claims aren't vetted by a regulatory body in the U.S., nor are the companies that make them required to provide proof substantiating those claims. </p><h2>Are there any safety or privacy concerns? </h2><p>Each tech device has its own safety and privacy considerations, which creates a lot of work for parents. A smartphone, for example, can give marketers, predators, and bullies a direct line to your child. A new video game, popular amongst your child's friends, might feature unexpectedly mature violent or sexual content. </p><p>To get a better handle on these issues, Radesky suggests that parents research what parental controls are available for devices and subscriptions. </p><p>Parents can also consult <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Common Sense Media's</a> wide-ranging reviews of games and apps. (Radesky has received research funding from Common Sense Media in the past.) <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Mozilla's *Privacy Not Included guide</a> offers reviews based on whether a product meets the company's minimum security standards. The guide includes a number of children's toys and games, as well as wearables and entertainment products, like Amazon and Apple tablets. </p><p>Once you better understand the potential safety and privacy tradeoffs, you can either decide against buying the product or choose to address them through parental controls or other protective settings.</p><h2>Can you swap the tech out for something else? </h2><p>Sometimes parents buy a tech device in an effort to solve one problem, like offering entertainment on long car rides, but the purchase inadvertently creates more conflict. </p><p>Radesky says parents should first consider how the tech will be used, and whether there's a more effective alternative. A parent interested in gifting a tablet or phone so their child can listen to music might instead look into smart or screen-free speakers, for example. </p><p>While less well-known than an <a href="https://mashable.com/category/amazon-echo" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon Echo</a>, the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/yoto-player-review-mini-children-speaker-gadget" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Yoto</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/toniebox-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Toniebox</a>, and Mighty offer different types of screen-free access to music, podcasts, and audiobooks. </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Privacy issues with these alternatives may still be a deal-breaker for some parents, but Radesky says they can also facilitate skill-building and social interactions in ways that a tablet can't. </p><p>Without a screen to focus on, children have to train their attention on whatever is playing on the device. Additionally, smart or screen-free speakers mean family dance parties or conversations about a podcast are much more likely to happen than if a child is staring at a phone or tablet.  </p><h2>What conversation do you need to have with your child? </h2><p>Radesky advises against letting your child use their gift without first talking to them about boundaries. You needn't have that conversation as they tear off the wrapping paper, but it's wise to chat with them before they start playing with the gift. </p><p>With their input, the discussion should focus on guardrails, such as parental controls and screen time limits. If there's an onboarding or setup process, Radesky recommends that parents do it alongside their child. That gives parents an opportunity to talk about any safety concerns while normalizing communication about technology and devices. </p><p>Depending on the product, you may also need to download a companion app or create your own account in order to connect to and monitor your child's account. </p><p>Importantly, parents should ensure that their child's age is accurately entered during setup, as it can affect default safety settings, such as the ability to message with other users or what kind of personal data is collected. </p><p>If you don't want to be a buzzkill, Radesky says you can let your child explore and play with their gift over the holidays with few or no time limits, then rein that use in before school starts. </p><p>Either way, parents should have low expectations of their child's ability to stop playing over the holiday break, and Radesky recommends not becoming anxious about that reality. Approach it with curiosity when your child spends several hours playing a new video game by simply asking, "How did that feel?" </p><p>And if reflecting on your plans to gift tech these holidays now has you doubting the impulse purchase of a deeply discounted product, that's OK. Radesky says you don't have to commit to the gift. </p><p>"You really want to go in with a sense of, 'I want to use this intentionally so that it doesn't feel like we're battling all the time," she says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This is according to real-life testing done by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/microsoft-recall-screenshots-credit-cards-and-social-security-numbers-even-with-the-sensitive-information-filter-enabled" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Tom's Hardware</a>, which found that this information (whether it was dummy text or real) would occasionally still get captured by Recall screenshots, which could <em>theoretically</em> then be viewed by someone else.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The security risks here are numerous and obvious. There is a filter for cutting out sensitive information from Recall screenshots that is on by default (imagine if it wasn't), but per Tom's Hardware, it only works some of the time. On obvious e-commerce websites, credit card numbers generally get filtered out. But in other places, like PDF forms, the filter doesn't catch them.</p><p>Recall has easily been the most talked-about and controversial part of Microsoft's recent push into artificial intelligence.

In short, it takes source material &mdash; e.g., meeting notes, diary entries, legal briefs &mdash; and condenses it into a podcast-like product where two AI hosts discuss the pertinent info. The idea is to provide a different mode of taking in the information, perhaps for the person too busy to read or who learns better via audio.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In the demo, CPO Kevin Weil, joined by OpenAI's Drew Schuster and Thomas Dimson showed how Projects could be used to create a Secret Santa project. Schuster uploaded the Secret Santa group and their requests, then asked ChatGPT to randomly assign them to each other. He then asked ChatGPT to draft an email to the group. In another example, Schuster uploaded notes about various home appliances and used ChatGPT to ask when he should change the water filter in his fridge. This is useful if you're super organized and already wrote down important notes about home maintenance. Or you could check your notes. </p><p>Moving on, Dimson used Projects to create a personal website while leaning on ChatGPT Canvas to modify the website template. ChatGPT recognized the template code and correctly made the modifications. </p><p>Projects was shipped (live in the livestream) to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Teams users, with Enterprise and Edu users receiving the feature early in the new year. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Gmail package-tracking feature was first launched in 2022, allowing users to tap on an email to get a summary of a package's status, including when it was shipped and when it's expected to arrive. For this holiday season, however, the feature is getting a bit of an update to make it even more useful. It's easy to make use of too, though you will have to enable it.</p><p>Enabling it is pretty easy if you have a package on the way. All you have to do is open up an email related to a package, and tap the "Allow" button under the prompt notifying you that you can track your packages in Gmail.&nbsp;</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Alternatively, you can preemptively enable package tracking so that it&rsquo;s on and ready to go when you start shopping. To do so, all you need to do is open the Gmail app on your phone, then tap on the three-line menu button on the top left-hand corner. Hit the "Settings" option, then look for "General Settings" on Android or "Data Privacy" on iOS, and find the "Package Tracking" option. Opt into it, and you should be good to go.</p><p>After you do so, you&rsquo;ll get cards at the top of your inbox telling you the status of any packages as those statuses change or delivery dates approach, and you&rsquo;ll get expanded cards at the top of related emails &ndash; which will allow you to jump straight to tracking or details related to the package.</p><p>You only need to opt into package tracking once, and after you do so, Gmail will automatically track your packages &ndash; handy for those who buy a lot online.</p><p>Features like this are likely to get increasingly supercharged over the next few years, as AI becomes more integrated with our digital lives. It's not hard to imagine a not-too-distant future when you&rsquo;ll be able to ask Google&rsquo;s Gemini for a summary of packages, only to have it surface these cards in the Gemini interface. In fact, it&rsquo;s so not hard to imagine that I had to check that it didn&rsquo;t <em>already</em> work (it doesn't). You can, however, ask Gemini in the Gmail window to summarize any packages, and it'll do its best to do so in text form. While it wasn't quite perfect when I tried this, it got pretty close, surfacing information about packages that were recently delivered, and some that I'm expecting over the next few days.</p><p>Regardless, Gmail&rsquo;s package tracking tool makes things a little more visual and a little more seamless.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>This TV is far more than just a TV. It's a gorgeous, 4K OLED canvas that you can hang up in your living room and turn into a work of art when you're finished watching your favorite shows and movies. It features a wide variety of art from Vincent van Gogh, Frida Kahlo, and other artists from the New York Museum of Modern Art. But you can also watch reality TV and action flicks on it, which is an amusing fact. This fan-favorite TV is heavily discounted, so if you've been waiting for the perfect centerpiece for your living room, you may just have found it here. </p><h2>Best phone deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<h3><strong>Why we like it</strong></h3><p>If you've been thinking about trying a new folding phone, you can't go wrong with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6, which opens up to a large, tablet-like screen to give you double the real estate. When closed, it functions like a normal smartphone so you can call and text, but the larger screen gives you plenty of room for apps, gaming, and whatever your heart desires. Plus, with Samsung's Galaxy AI features, you have access to a whole additional world of functionality, including photo editing tools that you'll love. </p><h2>Best smartwatch deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Tired of your Apple Watch? Or know someone who wants an Android-based smartwatch instead? The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 doesn't disappoint. Mashable's Alex Perry praised its "big and useful display" as well as its "thorough suite of health and fitness features" and "more than adequate battery life." It's a great option for Android users and a sleek watch in its own right, with all the functionality you'd expect from a smartwatch and the design you'd want from a traditional one. </p><h2>More Samsung deals</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGVRKq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Book%204%20Ultra&object_type=article&object_uuid=00oSg6NAnkCydhU9grijwwK&short_url=QGVRKq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Book 4 Ultra</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,749</strong> <s>$2,547</s> (save $650)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wGDoq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Tab%20S10%20Ultra&object_type=article&object_uuid=00oSg6NAnkCydhU9grijwwK&short_url=9wGDoq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a> &mdash; <strong>$999.99</strong> <s>$1,199.99 </s>(save $200)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6Onl?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Buds%203&object_type=article&object_uuid=00oSg6NAnkCydhU9grijwwK&short_url=Qp6Onl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3</a> &mdash; <strong>$139.99</strong> <s>$209.98</s> (save $69.99)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While it may not be the most glamorous gift in the world, everyone needs groceries. And it's no secret that grocery prices are extremely steep. Not only will $100 worth of free groceries go a long way for someone in your life, but they can also get them delivered to their door on a day they dread going out to the store. For a limited time, you can save $15 on an Instacart gift card at Amazon. Just add the $100 gift card option to your cart and the savings will be applied automatically.</p><h2>Amazon Echo Buds</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>A DNA test kit from AncestryDNA can help you connect with your family and understand yourself on a deeper level by testing your origins in over 2,600 global regions. You'll be able to connect with living relatives (if they've also taken an AncestryDNA test), so you can find long-lost cousins and uncles. Plus, you'll get insight into 40+ genetic traits, so you can see how your genes have influenced your appearance, fitness, sensory characteristics, and beyond &mdash;&nbsp;all from a spit sample. It's usually $119 per kit, but as of Dec. 13, you'll pay just $39 at Amazon. If you're at a loss for a gift idea this season, scoop this up.</p><h2>Sonos Era 100</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

This includes "financial harm, physical harm, identity theft, theft of services, potential for blackmail, the disclosure of private facts, the disclosure of contact information for victims of abuse, and other similar types of dangers." But definitions and the scope of the breach's harm is up to the discretion of companies themselves. </p><p>So far, most of the affected telecom networks have remained tight-lipped over the breach. T-Mobile has alerted customers that an infiltration of their network happened, but have retained that hackers were evicted and no customer data was actually accessed. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There's nothing like planning a fun day outside only to have a storm blow through and ruin your plans.

<p>A common dilemma shoppers face is "to Echo or to Echo Dot?" The <a href="https://zdcs.link/8ymgv?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20%28Fourth%20Generation%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&short_url=8ymgv&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Echo (Fourth Generation)</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/xJkgO?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20Dot%20%28Fifth%20Generation%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&short_url=xJkgO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Echo Dot (Fifth Generation)</a> are very similar at first glance. Given that the latest Dot was released in 2022 and the 4th Gen Echo came out two years before that, there are obvious technical upgrades in the Dot that don't exist in its bulkier predecessor.</p><p>But more importantly, when is a good time to shop for these devices? Yes, they're affordable, the Echo starts at $99.99 and the Dot $49.99, however, you don't need to &mdash; and shouldn't &mdash; buy them at full price. The best time to buy is during shopping holidays like <a href="https://mashable.com/category/black-friday" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Black Friday</a>, when you'll find Echos at their lowest prices ever.

On its round exterior, you'll find an action button, volume buttons, a mic-off button, a light-up ring, a power port, and a 3.5-millimeter audio output. With three distinct color options currently available at Amazon, this under-$100 device is sure to fit your home decor seamlessly.</p><p>Setting up the Echo is also seamless and you can use it within minutes. Indeed, the only things inside the package are the device itself, a power adapter, and two guides. The setup guide is highly visual, which is always a perk. To begin, you have to download the Alexa app and sign in. No, you don't need to have a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-cancel-amazon-prime" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime account</a> to use an Amazon smart device (though its range of possibilities surely increases for those of us who are Prime members). Plug in the included power adapter into the Echo and then plug the Echo into a wall outlet. The light ring on the Echo will turn blue when it&rsquo;s on and then orange when Alexa greets you. Next, connect the Echo to your home WiFi network. The Alexa app will then walk you through the rest of the setup process, including customizing your "wake word," mastering the pronunciation of your name, allowing access to phone contacts, and more.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Though this device is two years newer than the aforementioned Echo (4th Gen), it's actually $50 cheaper.</p><p>The Echo Dot weighs 10.7 ounces, a third of the size of the Echo, and its dimensions are 3.9 x 3.9 x 3.5 inches. This baby can easily fit on countertops, shelves, or nightstands. Similar to the Echo, it boasts an action button, a microphone-off button, volume controls, a light ring, and a power port. It pretty much comes with the same color options as the bigger Echo, except for its deep sea blue shade being slightly darker than the Echo's twilight blue shade. <em>Potayto, potahto</em>.</p><p>Setup is also a breeze with the Echo Dot. First, plug it into a wall outlet and open the Alexa app to start setup. (You&rsquo;ll need to download the Alexa app on your smartphone beforehand.) Once you open the app, select &ldquo;devices&rdquo; and then select the &ldquo;+&rdquo; icon.

Since it's a smart speaker that connects to the Alexa Voice Service, you use it to do everything from playing the latest hits to purchasing some kitchen staples to killing your boredom with a round of <em>Jeopardy!</em> Advanced sound technology helps the Echo immediately respond to you and recognize your voice. In fact, during the setup process on the Alexa app, Echo learns your voice's cadences and pitch by making you repeat some sample prompts. Impressive.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Prompt response: </strong>Beamforming technology, noise-cancellation, and seven microphones will enable the Echo to hear you from your nearby location. Just speak the wake word and say commands like &ldquo;Alexa, find an Amazon Music playlist,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Alexa, call Dad&rdquo; for immediate assistance. Something to note: Your speaker does not by any means have to be called Alexa. Other fun options include Echo, Ziggy, or Santa. Referring to your device as that last option unlocks a whole new <em>Ho-Ho-Ho</em> personality for it. Another thing to note: Amazon is getting better about accessibility, in the form of Adaptive Listening. This feature, when enabled, essentially gives you more time to finish speaking &mdash; Alexa's way of accommodating speech patterns like stuttering.</p><p><strong>Beats master: </strong>Of course the Echo can play music, but it&rsquo;s more than a basic speaker. It comes with Dolby premium sound that fills a whole room &mdash; with deep bass and clear high notes alike. If you have two Echo devices in one room, you can actually tell one of them to "play music everywhere," which will amplify sound to even higher levels and make for an actual at-home clubbing experience. Word of caution, however &mdash; Alexa didn't cooperate with me, strangely, when I tried to test out this feature. For those of us who are highly picky about music streaming services, Amazon lets you set default options which you can change at any time. Do you want Alexa to pick music from Apple Music but podcasts from Spotify? No problem, there's an option for that.</p><p><strong>Hands-free communication: </strong>If you need to message or call loved ones, the Echo has your back. You can use Alexa to communicate with people via phone or text on the Echo, without grabbing your smartphone. Plus, Alexa can also make household announcements across <a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-friday-amazon-echo-deals-2023" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon Echo</a> devices at home, so your family knows if dinner is ready or guests are arriving. Use the Drop-In feature to connect to other Amazon Echo devices or the Announcement feature to record cute messages in your own voice (accompanied by a range of sound effect offerings, including dinner bell, kiss, trumpet, as well as, a bit alarmingly, toilet flush and fart).</p><p><strong>Control smart devices: </strong>If you have other smart devices that work with Alexa, you can easily control them with Echo's Zigbee smart home hub. Just ask Alexa to dim the lights, adjust the room temperature, or turn on a compatible smart-plug-connected appliance. The best thing about this? You don&rsquo;t have to press any buttons, and you can even engineer routines for yourself ahead of time to set these processes in motion at a certain time in your home.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h3>Echo Dot</h3><p>Making the smart living switch isn&rsquo;t always budget-friendly, but the <a href="https://zdcs.link/EvE7X?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=deals&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Echo%20Dot&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&amp%3Bshort_url=EvE7X&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fdeals%2Fecho-vs-echo-dot&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20Dot&object_type=article&object_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&short_url=EvE7X&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Echo Dot</u></a> is affordable and provides great voice control features. These features aren't all that different from what you get with the Echo. The only true upgrades are new motion sensors that let you touch-control the device, the 1.73-inch front-firing speaker (versus a woofer and tweeters), and "Eero mesh network support so the Echo Dot can serve as a node for your Eero network if you use one,"&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/amazon-echo-dot-5th-gen" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">according to our sister site, PCMag</a>. Use the Dot to receive reminders, save cookie recipes to your app for future reference, bask your room in a night light glow, communicate with friends and family, soothe yourself with some white noise, and beyond.</p><p><strong>Listening companion: </strong>We&rsquo;ve all tried the conventional speaker setup, which typically involves too many outlets and wires. Echo Dot offers the opposite experience for all your listening needs. You can use your voice to play music through streaming services, including Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Spotify. Plus, Audible and other media forms are available on the Echo Dot. Ask Alexa to find the perfect playlist or podcast, and you&rsquo;ll have something to listen to when you cook in the kitchen, lounge on the couch, or work out in your living room. Another extra-cool feature? The Dot will start playing deep sleep music when it detects sounds of snoring &mdash; if you enable it to do so.</p><p><strong>Task help: </strong>There are times we wish that we had a personal assistant for little things, including making lists and scheduling calendars. The Echo Dot helps make your everyday routine (and entertainment) more seamless with voice control. Try saying: "Alexa, set a timer for five minutes," "Alexa, play the Reuters news briefing," "Alexa, open my daily horoscope," or "Alexa, find my phone." The possibilities are endless. Be sure to reference the "more" tab on the Alexa app to browse through all of the Echo Dot's offerings.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

If you have light bulbs, thermostats, or streaming media players that are compatible with Alexa, you can control their activity with the Echo Dot. Just speak to Alexa in your room of choice, and you can easily monitor lighting, temperature, and more with verbal commands. Also, if you enable sound detection routines, you can program a particular sound (dog barking, oven dinging, door opening) to trigger a certain Alexa Routine. This feature has an accessibility bonus since it can be used as a way to provide visual cues to those with hearing challenges. For instance, "if Alexa detects running water for a period of time... she can trigger the living room smart lights to flash on and off, serving as a visual reminder to shut off the faucet," as reported <a href="https://reviewed.usatoday.com/smarthome/features/sound-detection-for-alexa-routines" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">in USA Today</a>.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Price and competition</h2><h3>Echo</h3><p>At $99.99, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/8ymgv?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=deals&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Echo&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&amp%3Bshort_url=8ymgv&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fdeals%2Fecho-vs-echo-dot&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo&object_type=article&object_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&short_url=8ymgv&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Echo</u></a> is moderately priced, but it comes with benefits that go beyond other smart speakers. With its high-tech sound features, including Dolby audio, you&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy your favorite beats at the right volume. When you&rsquo;re entertaining guests, you can engage the multi-room music feature to turn your pad into a dance floor (adjusting bass settings accordingly). In addition to playing music, the Echo allows you to control smart devices and communicate with loved ones via voice control. It also comes with a skills range so extensive that it might take you months to try them all out.</p><p>The Echo comes with a one-year limited warranty that covers defects in materials and workmanship. If you would like additional protection, you can buy an extended warranty separately at Amazon.</p><p>In terms of competition, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Pg5By?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=deals&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=%2499.99%20Apple%20HomePod%20mini&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&amp%3Bshort_url=Pg5By&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fdeals%2Fecho-vs-echo-dot&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=%2499.99%20Apple%20HomePod%20mini&object_type=article&object_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&short_url=Pg5By&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">$99.99 Apple HomePod mini</a> can be considered a pretty close match (at least price-wise).

While this competitor might be a better choice for Apple fans, due to its easy iOS compatibility, Siri isn't as smart or loyal of an assistant as Alexa in our opinion.</p><h3>Echo Dot</h3><p>For those on a technology budget, the 5th Gen <a href="https://zdcs.link/EvE7X?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=deals&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Echo%20Dot&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&amp%3Bshort_url=EvE7X&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fdeals%2Fecho-vs-echo-dot&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20Dot&object_type=article&object_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&short_url=EvE7X&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Echo Dot</u></a> delivers all the smart speaker benefits at a fraction of the price. At $49.99, it&rsquo;s more affordable than other Amazon Echo devices (despite being the newest Dot) and still has desirable features like advanced voice recognition, smart device control, and assistance with small tasks via Alexa.</p><p>Unlike the Echo, the Echo Dot only comes with a 90-day limited warranty. It&rsquo;s applicable to defects in materials and workmanship and you can contact Amazon&rsquo;s Customer Service for assistance. This warranty, too, can be extended to a one-year, two-year, or even three-year plan for an additional fee.</p><p>If we're talking about what's available on the smart speaker market that can compare to the Dot, the Google-Assistant-powered <a href="https://zdcs.link/6gW0k?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=deals&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Nest%20Mini%20%282nd%20Generation%29&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&amp%3Bshort_url=6gW0k&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fdeals%2Fecho-vs-echo-dot&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Nest%20Mini%20%282nd%20Generation%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&short_url=6gW0k&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Nest Mini (2nd Generation)</a> immediately comes to mind, as it also costs $49.99. The Nest Mini is cute as a button (and weighs almost as much). It's compatible with streaming services like Spotify, Pandora, and iHeart Radio, as well as Youtube, has smart home pairing with Arlo, Nest, Ring, and other appliances, and it allows you to voice-purchase essentials from storefronts that aren't limited to Amazon. Still, with the Dot's new-and-improved front-firing speaker, there's no question that it wins the contest when it comes to quality audio. Also, with its upgraded temperature and movement sensors, the Dot seems to be leading the smart home game. I mean, what other speaker will listen for the sound of broken glass and immediately alert you to a potential robbery happening when you're MIA?</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Privacy concerns</h2><p>With all Amazon Echo devices comes concern about privacy. In the past, according to what reporter Jack Morse <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-stop-amazon-echo-alexa-recording-me" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wrote</a> for Mashable a few years back, "Alexa has been known to record people and rooms even when there's no wake word spoken intentionally &mdash; or spoken at all." The fact that it can be listening in on your most private conversations &mdash; or else sneakily gather info like a credit card number you say when purchasing something over the phone &mdash; is legitimately scary.</p><p>Amazon has realized that tons of people have been turning away from their Echo product line because of this very risk. That's why now, on the Alexa app, you can review your daily voice history and delete anything you don't vibe with, manage the access to data certain skills have, and more. On the exterior of both the 4th Gen Echo and 5th Gen Echo Dot, you can also find a mic-off button that will prevent any audio input from reaching Alexa. For more information about how Amazon handles user privacy, check out its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ots=1&amp;slotNum=2&amp;imprToken=dac54a6e-bd2c-c642-44d&amp;nodeId=GVP69FUJ48X9DK8V" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Q&amp;A on the matter</a>.</p><h2>So, to Echo or to Echo Dot?</h2><p>If you want a large smart speaker that delivers high-quality sound, allows you to engage in hands-free control, and use your voice to communicate with loved ones, the $99.99 <a href="https://zdcs.link/8ymgv?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=deals&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=4th%20Gen%20Echo&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&amp%3Bshort_url=8ymgv&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fdeals%2Fecho-vs-echo-dot&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=4th%20Gen%20Echo&object_type=article&object_uuid=03PwS1WD4dWPC8frNBOn8ZX&short_url=8ymgv&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">4th Gen Echo</a> is a good call.

The 75-inch model would look great in any home, and the 32-inch is an excellent option for any smaller spaces.</p><p>"Buy one, get one free" deals like this don't tend to stick around for very long.

<p>Choosing the right e-reader is a decision based on price, the need for special features, and where you get your books from. For instance, most e-readers are easily compatible with Libby but maybe you also want to take advantage of programs like Kindle Unlimited.</p><p>To decide what kind of e-reader is right for you, consider the overall design that best suits you. Is a touchscreen okay, or do you need buttons? If you want to take your e-reader near water, whether it be a bathtub or a pool, you'll also need to make sure you have a waterproof device.</p><p>Plus, it's worth considering special features. Are you an annotator who wants to write in the margins of your e-book? Or are you sick of multiple devices and need a tablet that you can read and stream on? All of these questions help you determine which e-reader or tablet will blend into your habits.</p><h2>Can you read on an iPad?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>"DIU's role is bringing the very best commercial tech to bear to meet critical warfighter problems with the focus, speed, and scale required to meet the strategic imperative," said DIU Director Doug Beck. "The result will help us scale the tech faster and more reliably, and will also help change the way the Department thinks about software development and delivery tempo for the future."

<p>But OpenAI has thumbed its nose at the joy of little children everywhere by restricting Santa Mode to teens and adults. How Grinch-y. Jokes aside, there is a reason for this. The 13-and-up age restriction applies to all of ChatGPT, a spokesperson told Mashable. According to OpenAI's terms of use, "You must be at least 13 years old or the minimum age required in your country to consent to use the Services. If you are under 18 you must have your parent or legal guardian&rsquo;s permission to use the Services." </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </div>
<p>Some kind of age restriction makes sense for use of a technology that might share harmful or inaccurate information. But it also raises the question of what kind of raunchy adult content Santa Mode could get up to. That said, OpenAI has trained ChatGPT to restrict certain adult content and prevent misuse. But the real trick would have been creating a truly kid-safe version of Santa Mode.</p><p>Of course parents can always use Santa Mode with their kids or a tech-savvy pre-teen could get their parent's permission to chat with Santa. But it kind of takes away from the festive fun, knowing that Santa Mode is almost exclusively a gimmick for adults that are already in on the world's greatest conspiracy.</p><p>Meanwhile we'll be pushing the limits of Santa Mode to see how "adult" it can be.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the livestream, CPO Kevin Weil and other OpenAI team members demoed ChatGPT assisting with how to make pour-over coffee.

The team also showed how ChatGPT supports screensharing by understanding an open message on a phone with Weil wearing a Santa beard. </p><p>The long-awaited announcement comes a day after Google <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-announces-agentic-gemini-2-point-0-image-audio-support" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">unveiled</a> the next generation of its flagship model, Gemini 2.0. The new Gemini 2.0 can also process visual and audio inputs and has more agentic capabilities, meaning it can perform multi-step tasks on the user's behalf. Gemini 2.0's agent features currently exist as a research prototype under three different names: Project Astra for a universal AI assistant, Project Mariner for specific AI tasks, and Project Jules for developers. </p><p>Not to be outdone, OpenAI's demo showcased how ChatGPT's vision modality accurately identified objects &mdash; and was even interruptible. And yes, part of this included a Santa voice option in Voice Mode, complete with a deep, jolly voice and lots of "ho-ho-hos." You can chat with OpenAI's version of Santa by tapping the snowflake icon in ChatGPT.

<p>Mashable's RJ Andersen appreciated this tablet for its <a href="https://mashable.com/review/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-plus" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">"impressive 12.4-inch LCD display"</a> and called it a "well-made, beautiful tablet that's even dust- and water-resistant." It boasts a 20-hour battery life, an S Pen included in the package, and it's great for just about any purpose you want to assign it, whether that's taking notes, checking out your favorite shows and movies, or getting some work done on the go. </p><p>Andersen appreciated how "natural" the S Pen felt in comparison to using an Apple Pencil, as well as its powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip that made it appropriately zippy. And it was great when put through the paces with several different use cases, so if you're not into iPads anymore or just want to try something else, you can scoop up this alternative for a great price. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Mozilla explained the change on the feature's <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-turn-do-not-track-feature" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">help center page</a>, saying "many sites do not respect this indication of a person's privacy preferences, and, in some cases, it can reduce privacy."</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">
        <span class="font-bold text-primary-400">SEE ALSO:</span>
        <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mozilla-monitor-service-data-brokers-breach" class="flex items-center text-secondary-300">
            <span class="ml-1">New service from Mozilla wants to protect you from data brokers</span>
            <svg class="ml-1 w-4 h-4 font-normal fill-current"><use href="https://mashable.com/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin"></use></svg>
        </a>
    </div>
<p>But this doesn't mean Firefox users are suddenly exposed to tracking from websites and third parties. Instead, Mozilla recommends an alternative signal called <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Global Privacy Control</a>. GPC is an initiative founded by privacy-minded browsers including Mozilla, Brave, DuckDuckGo, and organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "GPC is respected by increasing numbers of sites and enforced with legislation in some regions," said the help center page. In some jurisdictions like California with the CCPA act, data privacy rights are legally protected. </p><p>In place of the Do Not Track setting with the latest version of Firefox, users can select the option that says, "Tell websites not to sell or share my data." This setting will turn on the GPC signal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You don't need to buy a $500 gaming console to enjoy a high-end gaming experience. This Amazon gaming bundle gives you the essentials to get started with Amazon's game streaming service, Luna, for just $79.98. That's 38% off its usual price. The bundle includes the Fire TV Stick 4K Max and a Luna controller, which our friends at <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/amazon-luna-controller" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">PCMag</a> (also owned by Ziff Davis) called "an excellent gamepad that provides the optimal Luna game-streaming experience." The real standout is its separate WiFi connection, which helps reduce input lag as you play. While technically an optional add-on for the Luna gaming experience, they called it a "must-have." The Fire TV Stick 4K Max allows you to access popular games &mdash; all you'll need to get started is the Luna app and a Prime or Luna subscription. </p><h2>Sonos Ace</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

It's unsurprising, given that the brand makes some of our favorite audio equipment. They're aesthetically a 10, boast exceptional sound quality and spatial audio, and have a stellar 30-hour battery life with ANC. While we wish the ear cup seal was tighter to improve noise cancellation, Mashable's Deputy Reviews Editor Miller Kern still said she would recommend the Sonos Ace to "true audiophiles who value incredible sound quality above all else." The price is a bit steep at $449, but they're back down to their Black Friday price of $349 as of Dec. 12. That's 22% in savings.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/sonos-ace-headphones-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Check out Mashable's full review of the Sonos Ace</em></a>.</p><h2>Yeti Hopper M15 Soft Cooler</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>If you've ever tried to haul a full-size hard cooler across a parking lot for a tailgate or worse, a beach, then you know how much of a struggle it can be. That's where the Yeti Hopper M15 Soft Cooler takes the cake. Ideal for everything from overnight camping trips to beach picnics to tailgates, this soft cooler is easy to tote around, even when it's packed to the brim. Speaking of which, it can hold up to 32 cans or 15 pounds of ice in its leak-resistant, puncture-resistant, closed-cell rubber-insulated shell. It's usually $300, but you can save $90 and pick it up for only $210 as of Dec. 12. That's $15 cheaper than it was on Black Friday.</p><h2>Amazon Echo Hub</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>Instead of keeping smart device control locked inside of someone's phone in your household, Amazon created the Echo Hub. Think of it as our smart home's brain. It offers a full-featured control panel with instant access to all of your gadgets &mdash;&nbsp;smart lighting, cameras, switches, doorbells, thermostat, etc. Everyone can play music, stream videos, ask Alexa questions, dim the lights, adjust the temperature, or see who's on the other side of the door in one central spot in your home. As of Dec. 12, it's on sale for $124.99 &mdash; that's 31% off its usual cost of $179.99.</p><h2>Bose SoundLink Revolve+</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>Bose is a powerhouse in the audio world and its SoundLink Revolve+ II is further proof. It's one of our <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">favorite portable Bluetooth speakers</a> because of its true 360-degree surround sound experience. The second-generation speaker bumps up the battery life from 12 to 17 hours, is a bit louder, has improved bass levels, and features a convenient handle on top for portability. It's usually $329, but as of Dec. 12, you can pick it up at Amazon for only $229 and get a $10 Amazon credit to spend on a future purchase.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

The report is cited by the ACLU in its white paper.</p><p>The ACLU outlines four major areas of concern in its white paper, including the necessary accountability process of human-written reports Ferguson describes. In its analysis, the organization emphasizes the uncertainty stoked by biases and hallucinations inherent to the tech itself, and questions the transparency of these processes to the public at large &mdash; not to mention its data privacy implications. According to the organization, relying more on the interpretation of generative AI tools than human memory and a police officer's subjective observations is to the detriment of a fair judicial process. </p><p>If AI is the next frontier for police officers, the ACLU urges, it should be used only after human memory has been recorded. AI tools could transcribe audio-recorded verbal narratives created by the officers involved, the organization explains, which could be submitted in tandem for review. </p><p>But, contrary to the recommendations of civil rights groups, AI's leaders are steadily investing in police and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/open-ai-military-technology-pentagon-partnership" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">military applications</a> of their technology. </p><p>"Police reports play a crucial role in our justice system. They are central to the criminal proceedings that determine people&rsquo;s innocence, guilt, and punishment, and are often the only official account of what took place during a particular incident," the ACLU writes. "AI report-writing technology removes important human elements from police procedures and is too new, too untested, too unreliable, too opaque, and too biased to be inserted into our criminal justice system."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The iPad Pro got the M4 chip before any MacBook, making it not just the speediest tablet we've ever tested, but giving it more processing power than many laptops. Plus, the Mini, which still comes in a delightfully compact 8.3-inch size, got an upgrade to the A17 chip and is now compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro.</p><p>So with Apple's big year in tablets, it's no wonder they're the darling of the holiday season. If you're looking to gift a tablet to yourself or a loved one this season, iPads are a no-brainer. Not only do they have laptop-level speed and performance, but they're versatile. iPads let you work, design, stream, and read all from one compact device.</p><p>In the post-Cyber Week haze, Best Buy has kept the good deals rolling with a special Apple shopping event, offering exclusive savings on devices.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The best iPad deal you can find at Amazon is on the brand's base model. The<a href="https://zdcs.link/9wGDmR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20%2810th%20gen%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00eRG8SZf63uzKgts3LGWaJ&short_url=9wGDmR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> Apple iPad (10th gen)</a> is the best iPad for most people. The 10.9-inch screen is just the right size whether you're working or streaming shows on-the-go. For illustrators and hobbyists alike, this iPad is compatible with the USB-C and first generation of Apple Pencil. The A14 chip, while a few generations behind, still provides performance prowess that won't disappoint.</p><p>During Best Buy's Apple event, you can find the most savings on this device. It's down 20%, bringing it to $279 for $70 off. So if you're looking to get an iPad on a budget, you can score one for under $300 with this deal.</p><h3>More iPad deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aMvBpr?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Mini%20%28A17%20chip%2C%20128GB%2C%20WiFi%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00eRG8SZf63uzKgts3LGWaJ&short_url=aMvBpr&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple iPad Mini (A17 chip, 128GB, WiFi)</a> &mdash; <strong>$449</strong> <s>$499</s> (save $50)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6blKR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Air%2C%2011-inch%20%28M2%20chip%2C%20128GB%2C%20WiFi%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00eRG8SZf63uzKgts3LGWaJ&short_url=z6blKR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple iPad Air, 11-inch (M2 chip, 128GB, WiFi)</a> &mdash; <strong>$499</strong> <s>$599</s> (save $100)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aNDgyd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Pro%2C%2011-inch%20%28M4%20chip%2C%20256GB%2C%20WiFi%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00eRG8SZf63uzKgts3LGWaJ&short_url=aNDgyd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple iPad Pro, 11-inch (M4 chip, 256GB, WiFi)</a> &mdash; <strong>$899</strong> <s>$999</s> (save $100)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWd3Rn?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Pro%2C%2013-inch%20%28M4%20chip%2C%20256GB%2C%20WiFi%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00eRG8SZf63uzKgts3LGWaJ&short_url=QWd3Rn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple iPad Pro, 13-inch (M4 chip, 256GB, WiFi)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,099</strong> <s>$1,299</s> (save $200)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QddkL2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%2C%2013-inch%20%28M4%20chip%2C%20512GB%2C%20WiFi%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00eRG8SZf63uzKgts3LGWaJ&short_url=QddkL2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple iPad, 13-inch (M4 chip, 512GB, WiFi)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,299</strong> <s>$1,499</s> (save $200)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

Anyone hoping for a massive suite of cool new features will probably be disappointed, though, as this update is primarily focused on bug fixes. That said, there is <em>one</em> new thing you can do with your Apple Watch now.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

It's not a huge one, but for those who enjoy using Camera Control, it's probably very welcome. </p><p>If you want to take advantage of this or any bug fixes or security updates, go to Settings, then General, then Software Update on your Apple Watch. Make sure you plug the watch in before updating, too.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Let's be real: no one likes to vacuum. No one likes mopping, either. That's why robot vacuums are such a boon if you run a busy household and just don't have the time to keep running a traditional unit &mdash; and it's even better when it can mop, too. Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but you can still save big on an appliance that can take care of both needs for a major steal. </p><p>As of Dec. 12, get the <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao5wvg?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Yeedi%20M12%20Pro%2B%20robot%20vacuum%20and%20mop&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j0tH0QtfAEOBzy1canpAl&short_url=ao5wvg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Yeedi M12 Pro+ robot vacuum and mop</a> for just $549.99 at Amazon.

<p>This compact robovac and mop offers powerful suction with both flat and outward-rotating bristles that keeps it from getting tangled up in hair and losing its cleaning efficiency. It comes with its own compact station for auto-empty,  as well as a one tap self-cleaning option and an auto-refill with drain button for when you take advantage of the mop.</p><p>When it's finished sucking up all the dirt and debris in your floor, it can switch from carpet to floors that need to be mopped. It uses its special auto-lift mopping system to keep the mopping plates up out of the way when it detects carpet. And when it's time to use them, it offers great stain removal and powerful scrubbing with a 55mL water tank that can handle stains that have set in. </p><p>Whether you hate cleaning or you would prefer to take the day off and let a robot do all the hard stuff, this is a deal worth buying into before it's gone. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>iOS 18.2 release notes: 4 features to get excited about</h2><p>Per <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/12/05/ios-18-2-release-notes/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">9to5Mac</a>, these are the big features Apple included in its release patch notes for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ios-18-2-apple-mail-biggest-updates" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iOS 18.2</a>.</p><h3>Genmoji</h3><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-use-genmoji-on-ios-18" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Genmoji</a> allows users to create their own custom emoji with text prompts. The use cases here are fairly self-explanatory; sometimes you want to use an emoji that doesn't exist, so now, you can just create said emoji for yourself.</p><h3>Image Playground</h3><p>Image Playground is an all-encompassing app for generating new or altering existing images with AI. You can create images using text prompts, or import existing images from your Photos library to add things to them. These images can then be shared via Messages or other apps.</p><h3>Visual Intelligence</h3><p>Visual Intelligence is an iPhone 16-exclusive feature that allows users to long press the Camera Control button and take photos of objects to be analyzed by AI. Once the photo is taken, you can get more information about the object from <a href="https://mashable.com/category/chatgpt" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ChatGPT</a>, or have AI highlight any text in the image for you. Google Search is also included, in case you don't trust ChatGPT.</p><h3>ChatGPT integration with Siri</h3><p>Speaking of which, ChatGPT's previously announced integration with Siri is here with iOS 18.2. If you ask Siri something and it feels ChatGPT is more qualified to give an answer, you'll be prompted to optionally consult OpenAI's chat bot instead. This is done within Siri and does not require a ChatGPT account. Have fun!</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>If you're still on the hunt for gift ideas for someone in your life ahead of the holidays, or just looking to pick up a little holiday treat for yourself, Amazon is full of great options that are still on sale after <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-cyber-monday-deals-still-available-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Cyber Monday</a>. If you've been wanting to find something for the gamer in your life, one of our favorite deals at the moment is a Fire TV Stick 4K bundle which can get you setup with Xbox's Game Pass Ultimate library without even buying the console.</p><p>This <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4brBm?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Fire%20TV%20Stick%204K%20bundle&object_type=article&object_uuid=048PFhxrKLuq7PODeyWdO7O&short_url=Q4brBm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K bundle</a> comes with the aforementioned 4K streaming stick alongside the Sky Cipher Special Edition wireless controller and one month of an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership. With this, you can test out the Game Pass Ultimate library and play games like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> or the brand-new release <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>. This bundle is currently 45% off its full price, down to $74.99.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Compared to buying all of these items separately &mdash; which totals $136.97 without any deals on the individual items &mdash; you're able to pocket $61.98. That's a fantastic deal to be set up with Xbox and Game Pass Ultimate. Even investing in the 512GB digital Xbox Series S would cost you $299.99, so this is a great alternative to save some cash.</p><p>Deals like this don't usually stick around for long, though.

<h2>Size: It's in the name</h2><p>The most noticeable difference between the Echo Show 5 and the Echo Show 8 is, of course, their size. The Echo Show 5 has a 5.5-inch screen and 6-inch x 3-inch footprint, while the Echo Show 8 is significantly larger &mdash; boasting an 8-inch screen and an 8-inch x 4-inch footprint.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl">

                    </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>In my opinion, that makes the Echo Show 8 way better suited to be your family &ldquo;hub&rdquo; &mdash; located in a central location like the kitchen or dining room for easy video calls with the grandparents using Alexa. All you have to do is add contacts you&rsquo;d like to call in the Alexa app on your phone. However, it may not be a necessary purchase if you already have a tablet with great video functionality. And if you want a larger device as your smart home hub, the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/echo-show-10-amazon" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Echo Show 10</a> is an even better choice.</p><p>Regardless, the Echo Show 8 offers some other advantages for video calls in addition to its size.</p><p>On the other hand, the Echo Show 5 would be better in places where you want the device's functionality, without it being front and center &mdash; like your desk or nightstand.</p><p>And if you're a sucker for colorways, the Echo Show 8 only comes in the glacier white and charcoal color options. You can get more variety with the new Echo Show 5, which comes in glacier white, charcoal, and deep sea blue. The Echo Show 5 Kids comes in chameleon green.</p><h2>Camera and video calling</h2><p>The Echo Show 5 got a decent camera upgrade from its 1st gen version &mdash; increasing the megapixels from one to two. However, it was a whole different ball game for the Echo Show 8. While the 1st gen Echo Show 8 offered a 1 MP camera, the revamped 2021 model came equipped with a 13 MP camera, which carried over into the 2023 model. </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The image is <em>incredibly </em>crisp, and alongside the larger screen makes the Echo Show 8 the video call winner. But that&rsquo;s not even the best part: The Echo Show 8 features auto-framing functions that automatically pan and zoom the camera to keep it focused on the people in view.</p><p>Both devices also feature some handy connectivity features, like intercom to page every Alexa device in the house (&ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving in 15 minutes, so be ready!&rdquo;) and drop-in, which allows you to video chat with any connected Alexa device.</p><h3>Zoom calls</h3><p>The Echo Show 8 can also join Zoom calls, while the Echo Show 5 can&rsquo;t. To be totally honest, I could not get the Zoom call feature to work after several tries because none of the calls I joined had a dial-in number. </p><p>I&rsquo;ll still say the Echo Show 8 wins on this one just because it&rsquo;s theoretically possible, and I&rsquo;m really hoping to be able to join Zoom calls from it soon to free up my laptop and extra monitor for in-meeting multi-tasking.</p><h2>Kid-friendly content</h2><p>During the initial setup, you can choose to make any Echo Show device a dedicated device for a kid. This gives you access to some expanded parental controls, which is great for older children, tweens, and teens that you still want to shield from some of the worst things the internet has to offer.</p><p>However, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/91bGZw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20Show%205%20Kids&object_type=article&object_uuid=073bv393q3gg6vR5o1TbOpo&short_url=91bGZw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Echo Show 5 Kids</a> is the first and only Echo Show that&rsquo;s bottom-to-top and side-to-side designed for kids. It features a fun design (the chameleon color looks like dinosaur scales, according to my 5-year-old), and comes with a free year of Amazon Kids (usually $5.99 per month) &mdash; which offers curated books, games, and videos just for kids far beyond what&rsquo;s available through a basic Prime membership. In addition, it comes with souped-up parental controls so you can tweak things even more.</p><h2>Alexa functionality</h2><p>Both the 2nd gen Echo Show 5 and the 2nd gen Echo Show 8 have some Alexa abilities that their 1st gen counterparts don&rsquo;t.</p><p>First up is the home monitoring function, where you can remotely access the camera on your device from the Alexa app just to check in on things. You&rsquo;ll need a WiFi connection to do it, but I had no problems getting it to work. I can imagine it would be great to check in on pets, the babysitter, or just to take a peek at your home while on vacation to make sure everything is on the up and up.</p><p>Next is the addition of motion-enabled routines. This allows Alexa to detect when you enter or leave a room and use that activity to start a routine. Fair warning, this can open a can of worms re: privacy, but it also opens up some exciting possibilities for the smart home buff. You could have Alexa read your calendar when you walk into your office, or turn off all smart-enabled devices when there&rsquo;s no motion detected in the living room &mdash; and those are just two simple ideas. With the addition of Alexa-enabled devices or smart plugs, your options open up even more. Amazon does offer ways to manage these settings if you'd like to delete recordings or manage your data.</p><p>All of these devices feature the same Alexa functionality you came to expect from the previous iteration of Echo Show devices.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Echo Show 5 vs. Echo Show 8: Which one is better?</h2><p>For only $45 more, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/98bv7q?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20Show%208&object_type=article&object_uuid=073bv393q3gg6vR5o1TbOpo&short_url=98bv7q&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Echo Show 8</a> was the clear winner for me. Not only does it have a larger screen and a 13 MP camera with auto-framing (making it the best for video calling), it also allows you to hop on Zoom meetings, if/when you can get that function to work properly.</p><p>If video calls and Zoom meetings aren&rsquo;t your concern, then the <a href="https://zdcs.link/WmwNd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20Show%205&object_type=article&object_uuid=073bv393q3gg6vR5o1TbOpo&short_url=WmwNd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Echo Show 5</a> is still a great choice &mdash; like the 2nd gen Echo Show 8, the new Echo Show 5 boasts many of the same expanded Alexa functions, like home monitoring and motion detection routines. And of course, if you want one made for kids, then you&rsquo;ll want to go with the Echo Show 5 Kids.</p><p>Overall, I&rsquo;m a fan of both, but the Echo Show 8 came out on top for our home.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>T10 Elite automatically returns to its charging station when the battery runs low and resumes cleaning right where it left off once it's powered up. You don't need to monitor its progress, it's as independent as a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-shark-robot-vacuums" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">robot</a> can get.

The T10 Elite works with Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, making it easy to give it instructions without lifting a finger.</p><p>At a discounted price of $229.50 with code 2024XMAS, you're saving $100 on a model packed with premium features that usually come with a much higher price tag. Preparing for holiday guests or just looking to simplify your routine? This deal offers unbeatable value.</p><p>Deals on direct-from-brand websites don't last long, and this discount code runs out at the end of the year. Let Ultenic T10 Elite take care of your floors while you focus on the things that matter this Christmas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bad news? You have <em>a lot</em> of options, and your decision can get overwhelming fast. Wasn't life easier when our <a href="https://mashable.com/category/iphone" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhones</a> came with a free pair of earbuds?</p><p>Prices on earbuds range anywhere from under $10 to in the thousands (if you're going for professional-grade studio earbuds), but even in the narrower range most consumers occupy, you can easily spend up to $300. While we stand by the value of everything on this list, we know that spending $300 on a pair of headphones is a lot to stomach.

<h2>Are wired or wireless earbuds better?</h2><p>Though most earbuds are now wireless, this ultimately comes down to preference. If you have a tighter budget or don't want to worry about the battery running low all the time, wired earbuds are a great option. With that said, it is significantly harder to find wired earbuds with active noise cancellation (we're working on tracking down and testing a few pairs like this). So, if ANC is a priority for you, you'll be better off with a pair of wireless earbuds. </p><p>To help you decide, we put a range of wired and wireless earbuds to the test to determine which are worth your money. Whether you're simply looking for earbuds to get you through the work day, a pair to take with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-flying" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">you on a flight</a>, or a pair that you can live in 24/7, we have a set of buds for you.

<p>Amazon states that Autos customers can choose a vehicle, secure financing, electronically sign the relevant paperwork, and place their order "with a few clicks," "streamlining" the process of buying a car. The company's famous delivery service doesn't apply to Amazon Autos, though. Once a purchase is finalised, shoppers will be directed to choose a date and time to pick up their new car from a local dealership themselves.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re partnering with dealers and brands to redesign car shopping &mdash; making it more transparent, convenient, and customer-friendly," said global head of Amazon Autos Fan Jin. "With Amazon Autos, we&rsquo;re bringing the simplicity and ease customers expect from Amazon to car shopping, one of their largest purchases, while offering dealers a new channel to connect with a broad audience."</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Of course, the nature of online shopping does mean Amazon Autos eliminates a few previously ubiquitous elements of purchasing a new car, for better or for worse.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon Autos offers no opportunity to haggle, with set prices keeping costs "transparent" but preventing customers from attempting to negotiate a better deal. There also seems to be no option to test drive vehicles to see if you like how they feel, or any sales associates to consult about whether a different car might better fit your transportation needs. Some may miss that human interaction, however others will no doubt consider the lack of salespeople to be a point in Amazon Autos' favour.</p><p>Customers can trade in their current car by answering questions about its condition to have it valued, then dropping it off when they pick up their new one. New functionality such as leasing and additional financing options will also be added next year.</p><p>Amazon <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2023/11/hyundai-and-amazon-partner-to-deliver-innovative-customer-experiences-and-cloud-transformation" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">initially announced that it had partnered with Hyundai</a> to sell its cars online in the U.S. last November.

      <description><![CDATA[Unblock and watch U.S. Netflix from anywhere in the world with a streaming-friendly VPN.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/04qgd80xTaW4kYEBpwViXd7/hero-image.jpg" alt="Netflix on laptop"><p>Collecting all your favourite snacks and drinks, surrounding yourself with comfortable cushions and blankets, and then spending hours in front of a screen can be a truly therapeutic experience. Unfortunately, there is one big problem with this hobby: There is a limited amount of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/streaming" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">content</a> out there to keep you entertained.</p><p>We're a greedy bunch, and regular <a href="https://mashable.com/category/netflix" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">streamers</a> can easily get to a point where it feels like there's nothing left to watch. What are you supposed to do then? Don't panic, because there is a simple solution to this frustrating issue.</p><p>If you've reached this point of streaming shortage, you should consider investing in a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-vpn-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPN</a>. It will likely unlock a lot of shows and movies on services to which you're already subscribed.</p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/vpn" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPNs</a> are security tools that provide protection for your information by creating a private network that hides your real IP address (digital location). All of your activity is untraceable and secure, because all of your online traffic passes through an encrypted tunnel. Nobody can see into the tunnel, and everything inside the tunnel is protected against online threats like hackers, viruses, and malware.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>The act of hiding your real IP address is what can trick leading streaming sites into thinking you are based in another country.</p><h2>Do you need a VPN?</h2><p>VPNs are used to provide <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-anonymity-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">protection for your sensitive </a>information, which is obviously super important. This isn't the only reason VPNs are so popular though, because these tools can be also be used to watch content that is normally blocked in your location.</p><p>By hiding your real IP address and connecting you to a server in another country, you can watch all your favourite content from that location. For example, you could watch all the extra films and shows on American Netflix that are not usually accessible outside of the U.S. There is so much content out there that can be accessed with the help of a VPN.</p><p>Everyone is in need of something that can bypass geo-restrictions to access all of this blocked entertainment, and that something is a VPN. These services are keys to the online world, granting you access to more of the shows and films you love. </p><h2>How to unblock U.S. Netflix</h2><p>If you think accessing American Netflix is going to be difficult with a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-amazon-prime-video-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPN</a>, think again. It's actually a really simple process that absolutely everyone can understand:</p><ol><li><p>Sign up to a streaming-friendly VPN (like <a href="https://go.expressvpn.com/c/190434/1462855/16063" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ExpressVPN</a>)</p></li><li><p>Download the app to your device of choice (the best VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and more)</p></li><li><p>Open up the app and connect to a server in the U.S.</p></li><li><p>Visit Netflix to watch movies and shows from the U.S. content library</p></li></ol><p>If you're worried that this whole thing sounds a bit illegal, then maybe we can reassure you. It's currently legal to watch Netflix while using a VPN, although we should point out that Netflix states in its <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31YV?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=terms%20of%20service&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=04qgd80xTaW4kYEBpwViXd7&short_url=z31YV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>terms of service</u></a> that it may restrict your account without compensation or notice if you are engaged in "improper" use. We're not entirely sure what that means, but consider yourself warned.</p><p>We should make it very clear that you still need to be subscribed to Netflix for this trick to work. A VPN is not going to grant access to the streaming site for free. A VPN provides access to more libraries from around the world, once you're subscribed.</p><h2>Should you use free VPNs?</h2><p>There are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-free-vpn-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">free versions</a> and free trials of VPNs, so why would you ever consider paying for a service? As with most things in life, you get what you pay for with VPNs. </p><p>There is always a catch with free versions, and it's normally in the form of limited data usage. These plans will be just fine if you're just an occasional user, but if you're going to be <a href="https://mashable.com/category/streaming" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">streaming</a> or downloading anything, this isn't going to work. Free trials are different as come with everything you get in a paid plan, but obviously they don't tend to last very long. Trials are great for testing out a service before committing, but this isn't a long-term solution.</p><p>To gain access to advanced security features without limitations on usage, you generally need to pay up. That being said, services like ProtonVPN offer an impressive set of features for free. However, you might have trouble streaming Netflix with this free version.</p><h2>What is the best VPN for Netflix?</h2><p>There are a lot of VPN services out there that can effectively unblock American Netflix, but which is the best? There are plenty of strong options for you to consider, but we wouldn't want you wasting your time checking everything out. To save you time, we've handpicked your best options. Each service has a different set of features that will suit some users better than others, and it's all about finding something that works for you.</p><p>ExpressVPN is at the top of this list because it combines essential features with impressive results, but it isn&rsquo;t the only option available to you. We have lined up all the best VPNs for unblocking Netflix, with something for everyone on this list. We've highlighted the <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best deals</a> on the likes of <a href="https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=435&amp;aff_id=1995" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Surfshark</a>, <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/8608?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=PureVPN&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=04qgd80xTaW4kYEBpwViXd7&short_url=8608&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">PureVPN</a>, <a href="https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/offer/sdh_qwcvea7" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">CyberGhost VPN</a>, and <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=340&amp;aff_id=682" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NordVPN</a>.</p><p>These are the best VPNs for Netflix in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Sit back and let something else do all the hard work for you.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/02MHAPy6HLWzda9r9omIQ3D/hero-image.jpg" alt="A robot vacuum cleaner on a hardwood floor"><p><em>This content originally appeared on Mashable for a US audience and has been adapted for the UK audience.</em></p><p>If you've got the money to spend, a robot vacuum is always a good purchase. Here are some basic questions to help you decide whether you should buy or not: do you like cleaning the house? No, we thought not. Do you like relaxing and putting your feet up? Yes, of course you do. In that case, you absolutely need a robot vacuum in your life.</p><p>Unless you're tech-savvy, choosing a robot vacuum cleaner to whizz around your home can be easier said that done. There are dozens of models out there, all offering variations on the same thing. And there are other questions that need answering: Is a robot vacuum worth the money? How do they work? And which is the best brand? </p><p>If all that's got your head spinning, don't worry: We're here to help. We're looked around and done some research on your behalf, which means even more time to put your feet up. Here's a quick guide on robot vacuums &mdash; and our pick for the best models you can buy right now.</p><h2>Are robot vacuums worth buying?</h2><p>The crisp control of a regular, upright vacuum is its own particular pleasure. But if you're someone who finds cleaning stressful, a robot vacuum could cut a major task off your to-do list. Whether robot vacuums are worth it or not comes with a caveat: It can't be just any robot vacuum. A <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-cheap-robot-vacuums-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cheap robovac</a> that acts drunk &mdash; scattering dust rather than sucking, bumping into walls, getting stuck on rugs &mdash; defies the point. Robot vacuums are made to be convenient &mdash; so get one that makes life easier.</p><h2>What are the most important robot vacuum features?</h2><p>Here's a rundown of essential features to consider when buying a robot vacuum:</p><ul><li><p><strong>App control </strong>&mdash; WiFi-enabled robot vacuums can be synced with a smartphone app to control scheduling and other features. If you're used to asking Alexa or Google to turn off the lights or tell you the weather, a model with voice integration will blend in nicely.</p></li><li><p><strong>Battery life</strong> &mdash; Larger spaces require more time to clean, which means you'll want a battery that lasts. Run times for the list below range between 115 and 240 minutes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Docking station </strong>&mdash; Many robot vacuums have a multipurpose docking station. The robovac will return to the dock automatically and self-empty its bin while also charging the battery. The docking station may double up as a bin that can hold debris.</p></li><li><p><strong>Floor types &amp; mopping</strong> &mdash; Depending on the floors you have at home, look out for models that have features for both carpet and hard floors. This may include the ability to climb up on higher pile rugs. There are also hybrid models that mop hard floors.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Low-profile cleaning</strong> &mdash; No one should have to be scared about what's accumulated under their sofa over the past year. A robot vacuum measuring three inches or less in height should be able to scoot under most low-hanging sofas and beds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Navigation &amp; mapping</strong> &mdash; Every robot vacuum is equipped with sensors and drop detection. But if your home has lots of rooms, lots of turns, or lots of close-together furniture, you'll have fewer navigation issues with an advanced model that uses intelligent mapping to remember exactly how your home is laid out.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pet hair cleaning </strong>&mdash; Pet owners should consider a model with an anti-tangling roller brush, which will make it easier to pick up cat and dog hair and will prevent the robot vacuum from clogging up.</p></li><li><p><strong>Suction power</strong> &mdash; A vacuum is the one purchase that you hope sucks a lot. Suction power is typically measured in Pascals (Pa), ranging between 2,500 and 8,000 Pa in the ones on this list. Stronger sucking will be needed to pick up heavier pieces of debris and to pull patted-down pet hair from rugs.</p></li></ul><p>Keep these features in mind when shopping around for a robot vacuum.</p><h2>What is the best robot vacuum?</h2><p>It's not a one-size-fits-all situation. "Best" to someone with four dogs and lots of carpet may not mean "best" to someone with a huge house filled with wooden floors. To help make sense of this confusing situation, we have highlighted a selection of the very best robot vacuums for everyone.</p><p>These are the best robot vacuums in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[The YouTube Kids app for iOS and Android devices just got a big new update.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03FyDTvGvTtmhSB8OsAOm7F/hero-image.jpg" alt="YouTube Kids app"><p>Your small children being on YouTube is inevitable at this point. From experience, I know kids master how to swipe and scroll on touchscreens at just months old. This is why YouTube launched a YouTube Kids app for iPhone and Android devices back in 2015.</p><p>Now, for the first time since that launch, YouTube Kids has received a complete redesign. With that update, YouTube Kids looks a lot more like YouTube.</p><p>"As part of YouTube's design modernization efforts, we&rsquo;re happy to announce that we&rsquo;re bringing a new look and feel to the YouTube Kids mobile app!" reads a new update posted by YouTube earlier this week on the official YouTube Kids community site.</p><h2>Here's what's new in the YouTube Kids app</h2><p>The biggest update to the YouTube Kids app is obvious: The redesign.</p><p>Previously, YouTube Kids (as seen above) looked like an app for children. It barely resembled the current YouTube design at all.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

        </div>
    </div>
<p>The new YouTube Kids (as seen below) looks like YouTube, but with a kids-oriented twist. The design is more colorful and visual, but it still distinctly like YouTube. The previous design was geared toward toddler-aged children, whereas this one looks like it's meant to be enjoyed throughout childhood.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

    </div>
<p>The redesign also brings a more YouTube-like user interface to YouTube Kids as well. YouTube Kids now displays video categories at the top of the homescreen just like YouTube does. The new navigation bar at the bottom of the page is basically straight from the main YouTube app as well.</p><p>Another big change is that YouTube Kids can now be used both horizontally and vertically just like the main YouTube app. Previously, YouTube Kids had to be used in landscape mode. But, now that shortform video is popular on the platform thanks to YouTube Shorts, that no longer makes sense.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

        </div>
    </div>
<p>Aside from the redesign, everything else in YouTube Kids is basically the same. The app remains the best way for kids to safely watch age-appropriate YouTube content. YouTube has greatly improved the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/youtube-kids-new-policy" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>content moderation issues</u></a> that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/spiderman-elsa-youtube-kids-videos" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>plagued the app</u></a> years ago.</p><p>A few comments on YouTube's update announcement have generated a negative response to the redesign. However, like it or not, the redesigned app should be preferable to what YouTube did to its smart TV kids app. Earlier this year, YouTube completely <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-shutting-down-youtube-kids-for-tv" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>shut down</u></a> its standalone kids app for TVs and integrated it into the main YouTube app for smart TVs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Open AI has released Sora, its AI video engine. How will its imaginary output affect a world already struggling with what's real?]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05Ezy0P8TMJgmvmoHnGMCWR/hero-image.jpg" alt="A Sora video on a phone atop the OpenAI logo"><p>There's a story from the earliest days of cinema that seems applicable to Sora, the text-to-video creation tool launched by OpenAI this week. And given that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-restricting-sora-depictions-of-people-due-to-safety-concerns" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sora's servers are struggling with demand</a>, with many OpenAI subscribers still waiting to try it out, we've got time for stories.</p><p>You probably know of <em>Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station </em>(1896) by the Lumiere brothers, even if you've never seen it. Like Sora, the Lumieres created very short movies that showcased the latest tech. We're talking cinematograph rather than AI rendering, and a luxurious 50 seconds of film rather than the maximum 20 seconds allowed in Sora videos. </p><p>Still, it's the same principle: This was an early peek at a shockingly new form of entertainment. According to legend &mdash; a legend cemented in Martin Scorcese's charming movie about a boy in the Lumiere era, <em>Hugo</em> (2011) &mdash; <em>Arrival of a Train</em> audiences ran in terror from a steam engine that appeared to be heading straight for them. </p><p>A similar sense of panic clings to Sora &mdash; specifically, panic about what AI videos might do to further crack up our "post-truth" media landscape. The average viewer is already having a hard time judging what is real and what isn't, and the problem is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/depression-misinformation-mental-health" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">worse if they're depressed</a>. We're living in a golden age of conspiracy theories. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-shares-doctored-kamala-harris-campaign-video" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The world's richest man already shared an AI deepfake video</a> in order to help swing an election. </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>What happens when Sora can make <em>any</em> prompt look as real as something you might see on the evening news &mdash; ready-made to spread on social media? </p><p><a href="https://openai.com/index/sora-is-here/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">OpenAI seems to think its watermarks, both visible and invisible</a>, would prevent any shenanigans. But having downloaded dozens of Sora videos now, I can attest that the visible watermark is tiny, illegible, and fades into the background more often than not. It would be child's play for video editing software to clip it out altogether. </p><p>So a world of deliberate disinformation, either from bad political actors or influencers trying to gin up their engagement, is barreling down on us like a train. Right? </p><p>Wrong. Because as the actual story of the Lumiere movie tells us, humans are actually a lot smarter about new video entertainment than we give them credit for. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-MT-70ni4Ddo"></div>
</div>


<p>Here's the thing about <em>Arrival of a Train</em>: the legend is almost certainly wrong. We have zero first-hand evidence that audiences fled the cinema, or even flinched when they saw a train approaching in a 50-second clip. </p><p>Media studies professor Martin Loiperdinger calls the panic tale "<a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/171125" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cinema's founding myth</a>," and notes it can be traced back to books written in the second half of the 20th century. It's possible that authors conflated it with the Lumieres' later experimental 3-D version of <em>Arrival of a Train</em>, which screened a handful of times in 1934 and was &mdash; like a lot of 3-D movies to come &mdash; a novelty, and a commercial failure. </p><p>So no, early audiences likely did not confuse a moving image of a train with a real train. Rather, they seem to have adapted to the whole concept of movies very quickly. Contemporary accounts of the Lumiere shorts (of which there were dozens; <em>Arrival of a Train</em> was not seen as a stand-out) are filled with excitement at the possibilities now unlocked. </p><p>"Why, if this continues," wrote one newspaper, <em>Le Courier de Paris</em>, in 1896, "we could almost overcome memory loss, almost put an end to separation, almost abolish death itself." (Spoiler alert: we did not, although that sounds like a great premise for a 19th century <em>Black Mirror</em> episode.) </p><p>Another periodical, <em>La Science Francais</em>, enthused about the "most unbelievably wonderful sorcery" that had created the cinematograph's "hallucinatory phantasmagoria." Even today's most tech-happy AI boosters would have a hard time endorsing Sora in the same terms. </p><p>Because like most AI, Sora is often "hallucinatory" &mdash; and not in a good way. </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>As I discovered in the moments that OpenAI servers weren't slammed, almost every Sora-generated video has some detail that looks wrong to human eyes. I typed a prompt for "journalist slams desk in frustration at not being able to access AI videos," then noticed a pen that appears and disappears in the journalist's hand. </p><p>The mistakes went on and on. The novelty factor diminished fast. Friends were amused and a little freaked out by the realness of the swag in "hip-hop artist models a cozy Christmas sweater" &mdash; until we spotted that the rapper's gold chain had become a gold pony tail at the back, and the reindeer on the sweater had eight legs. </p><p>Sora's response to "a funeral mass with circus clowns" pretty much nailed the prompt ... except that the colorful-wigged, red-nosed figure in the casket was missing his body. </p><p>That's not to say Sora won't have an immediate impact on the moving image industry. Given less outlandish prompts, it could certainly replace a lot of the generic B-roll often seen in YouTube explainers and corporate training videos. (That's assuming OpenAI isn't going to be forced to cease and desist <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-sora-ai-video-generator-training-data" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">training Sora on internet video footage</a> without the makers' permission.) </p><p>It <em>is</em> to say that there's a significant barrier to entry when it comes to creating videos featuring anything unusual, anything you're trying to lie about, anything that Sora hasn't been specifically trained on. Rooting out all those mistakes, to the point where we won't immediately notice, can be an exercise in frustration. </p><p>And perhaps these early mistake-filled AI videos will serve as a kind of mass inoculation &mdash; a small dose of the post-truth disease, one that effectively gives our brains AI-resistant antibodies that can better prepare us for a future epidemic of visual fakes. </p><h2>AI video needs to board the clue train</h2><p>I'm certainly less impressed with AI after I prompted Sora for a new take on the Lumieres' <em>Arrival of a Train.</em> I asked for a video where a locomotive <em>does</em> actually break through the projection screen at the end, crushing the cinematograph audience. </p><p>But Sora couldn't even access the original 50-second short, which is <em>way</em> out of copyright and widely available online (including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7laguPTT-Q" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">a version already upscaled by AI</a>). It hallucinated a movie called "Arrival of a tal [sic] train," apparently released in the year "18965." </p><p>As for breaking a literal fourth wall, forget about it: despite multiple prompt-rewording attempts, Sora simply couldn't grok what I was asking. The projection screen remained intact. </p><p>Still, this version of Sora may still be a harbinger of some terrifying visual fakery to come &mdash; perhaps when more robust AI video tech falls into the hands of a future D.W. Griffith. </p><p>Two decades passed between <em>Arrival of a Train </em>and Griffith's infamous movie<em>The Birth of a Nation </em>(1915)<em>&mdash; </em>the first real blockbuster, a landmark in the history of cinema, which also happened to be a skewed take on recent American history stuffed with racist lies. </p><p>Griffith's movie, protested at the time by the NAACP, was hugely influential in perpetuating segregation and reviving the Ku Klux Klan. </p><p>So yes, perhaps Sora's release is slowly nudging us further in the direction of a fragmented post-truth world. But even in an AI-dominated future, bad actors are going to have to work overtime if they want to do more damage to society than the cinematograph's most dangerous prompts. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Sizes and screens</h2><p>When it comes to display quality and screen size, there&rsquo;s quite a bit of variety to choose from, especially when it comes to Fitbit. Because the brand offers both activity trackers and smartwatches, their trackers tend to be a bit smaller, simpler, and more discreet &mdash; the 1.45-inch <a href="https://zdcs.link/4A4ZX?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Charge%206&object_type=article&object_uuid=06uHh7kWFtP5i0jqEzuSvV4&short_url=4A4ZX&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Charge 6</a> touts a full-color AMOLED display with a maximum brightness of 450 nits &mdash; while their smartwatches offer larger, higher-quality displays.

<p>While Apple doesn&rsquo;t offer traditional fitness trackers, it does offer a solid range of smartwatch sizes &mdash; which is definitely a win compared to Fitbit&rsquo;s single-size smartwatch offerings. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/Adnjp?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Series%209&object_type=article&object_uuid=06uHh7kWFtP5i0jqEzuSvV4&short_url=Adnjp&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Series 9</a> is available in 41mm or 45mm (with the SE available in 40mm or 44mm, as well as the Ultra 2 in 49mm), and it has an unmatched Retina LTPO OLED display with a maximum brightness of 2,000 nits.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Winner: Apple</strong></p><h2>Internal hardware</h2><p>While Fitbit boasts a broader product range, which means a wider variety of internal hardware, I decided to pit smartwatch against smartwatch to see which has the most impressive specs in this category. I was pleased to discover the Google Pixel Watch 2 utilizes a Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 chip, as well as 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, but the Apple Watch Series 9&rsquo;s specs are equally impressive with Apple&rsquo;s S9 chip, 1GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. Performance-wise, it would be pretty hard to distinguish between the two without rigorous side-by-side testing.</p><p><strong>Winner: Tie</strong></p><h2>Health and fitness tracking</h2><p>Both Apple Watch and Fitbit offer access to user-friendly health and fitness tracking, which means both brands allow you to track various metrics like steps, heart rate, workout duration, calories burned, sleep, and more. However, the best fitness tracker ultimately depends on what data you&rsquo;re interested in tracking, as this varies from brand to brand <em>and</em> from product to product.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>For example, both Fitbit and Apple Watch offer sleep tracking, so you can track things like sleep duration and sleep stages, but both the Series 9 and the Google Pixel Watch 2 have relatively shorter battery lives (18 hours versus 24 hours, respectively). This makes them less-than-ideal for 24/7 wear, especially since they&rsquo;re a bit bigger than other sleep trackers like the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/oura-ring-4-hands-on" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Oura Ring</u></a>. However, Fitbit&rsquo;s other activity trackers &mdash; including the Luxe, Charge 6, and Inspire 3 &mdash; all boast five days of battery life (or more), making them better options for those interested in sleep data.</p><p>If you want to track GPS on your runs, both Apple Watch and Fitbit offer built-in GPS on most of their products (aside from the Fitbit Luxe and <a href="https://mashable.com/review/fitbit-inspire-3" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Inspire 3</a>). Heart Rate Zone training is also possible with both the Pixel Watch 2 and the Series 9, so you can get notifications mid-workout while changing zones, which isn&rsquo;t available on other Fitbit products.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though Fitbit does some pretty cool health tracking insights &mdash; including skin temperature, heart rate variability, and oxygen saturation &mdash; none of these are measured using the Google Pixel Watch 2 unless you wear it overnight. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch supports all of these measurements (aside from the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-blood-oxygen" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>since-removed blood oxygen feature</u></a>) without needing to wear the watch overnight.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Winner: Tie</strong></p><h2>Smartwatch functionality</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for the best smartwatch between Apple Watch and Fitbit, the answer is pretty clear: choose whatever is compatible with your phone. Apple does seem to have the better smartwatch overall, but that doesn&rsquo;t really matter much if you aren&rsquo;t an iPhone user.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>If you&rsquo;re an <a href="https://mashable.com/category/android" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Android</a> user, the Pixel Watch 2 does stand out over other Fitbit smartwatches. It&rsquo;s sleek, easy to use, and packed full of useful apps and features &mdash; including Google Assistant, Safety Check, and the Google Play Store &mdash; making it a more robust smartwatch than other models from Fitbit. Is it the best Android smartwatch on the market? It&rsquo;s hard to say, especially since the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Samsung Galaxy 6 </u></a>has a pretty solid reputation, but it&rsquo;s worth watching to see what Google does with Fitbit next.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re an <a href="https://mashable.com/category/iphone" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone</a> user, however, stick with an Apple Watch over a Fitbit smartwatch. Technically, Fitbit&rsquo;s other smartwatches &mdash; the <a href="https://zdcs.link/mVgEq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Versa%204&object_type=article&object_uuid=06uHh7kWFtP5i0jqEzuSvV4&short_url=mVgEq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Versa 4</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/NMAod?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sense%202&object_type=article&object_uuid=06uHh7kWFtP5i0jqEzuSvV4&short_url=NMAod&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sense 2</a> &mdash; are compatible with both Android and iOS, but some of the features (like smartphone notifications) only work with Android phones&hellip;and it&rsquo;s hard to beat Apple&rsquo;s smartwatch experience.</p><p><strong>Winner: Apple Watch</strong></p><h2>Battery life</h2><p>As far as battery life, Fitbit takes the crown. The Apple Watch Series 9 does offer an 18-hour battery life (36 hours in low power mode), but the Google Pixel Watch 2 slightly outperforms it with an advertised 24-hour battery life. Other Fitbit products are even more impressive, with a six+ day battery life for Fitbit&rsquo;s other smartwatches Versa 4 and Sense 2, as well as a five-day battery life for the Fitbit Luxe, seven-day for the Charge 6, and a whopping 10-day charge for the Inspire 3.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Winner: Fitbit</strong></p><h2>Durability and longevity</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a fitness tracker that can handle all kinds of wear and tear, both Apple Watch and Fitbit are pretty reliable options. All of Fitbit&rsquo;s products are water resistant up to 50 meters, and the Pixel Watch 2 holds a water-protection rating of 5 ATM (up to 50 meters), as well as an additional IP68 dust and water-protection rating. Apple Watches are also water resistant up to 50 meters &mdash; with the Series 9 holding an additional IP6X10 dust resistance rating (the SE does not) &mdash; while the Ultra 2 takes the cake with water resistance up to 100 meters, IP6X dust resistance, and an additional EN13319 rating for recreational scuba diving up to 40 meters.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as longevity, it&rsquo;s hard to make a straight comparison between the brands due to the variety of options available. Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fitbit/comments/xih84q/fitbit_lifespan_info/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Reddit users</u></a> say that their Fitbit trackers tend to last around two years, while other Redditors <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/15mzybc/what_is_the_general_lifespan_of_an_apple_watch/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>report</u></a> that their Apple Watch typically lasts four to six years. This is pretty on par with my experience, as I&rsquo;ve been using a Series 4 Apple Watch since January 2019 with no issues. Will the Google Pixel Watch 2 hold up quite as long? It&rsquo;s a little too soon to tell.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Winner: Apple Watch</strong></p><h2>Smartphone compatibility</h2><p>You might be wondering, &ldquo;Is Fitbit compatible with iPhone?&rdquo; Honestly, it depends.</p><p>The Fitbit app is compatible with most popular smartphones &mdash; including iOS and Android devices &mdash; and all of Fitbit&rsquo;s products are technically compatible with iPhone, aside from the Google Pixel Watch and the Pixel Watch 2. However, it&rsquo;s important to note that Fitbit&rsquo;s other smartwatches (the Versa 4 and the Sense 2) are <em>technically</em> compatible with iPhones, but that doesn&rsquo;t include many of the additional features like smartphone notifications.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, the best option for you depends on your phone. If you use an iPhone, stick with an Apple Watch or one of Fitbit&rsquo;s activity trackers. If you use an Android device, you can use any of Fitbit&rsquo;s products, which technically makes Fitbit the winner of this category.</p><p><strong>Winner: Fitbit</strong></p><h2>Price range</h2><p>Fitbit&rsquo;s wider product range means it has a better price range, too. If you&rsquo;re operating on a budget, that means Fitbit is the way to go. Its activity trackers are quite a bit cheaper than its smartwatches, with the Inspire 3 starting at $99, and its most popular tracker, the Charge 6, clocks in at $159.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a smartwatch, however, the prices are a little more comparable between brands. The Google Pixel Watch 2 starts at $349, making it slightly cheaper than the Apple Watch Series 9 (starts at $399) and slightly more expensive than the Apple Watch SE (starts at $249).&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, technically, there are more smartwatch options available from Fitbit &mdash; the Versa 4 ($199) and the Sense 2 ($249) &mdash; but considering they lack app stores, it doesn&rsquo;t really feel right to put them on the same tier as the Pixel Watch 2 or the Series 9. Fitbit also offers a kid-friendly smartwatch, the Ace LTE ($299), but it requires an additional $9.99 per month data plan.</p><p><strong>Winner: Fitbit</strong></p><h2>Other features</h2><p>While I enjoyed using Fitbit&rsquo;s products, there weren&rsquo;t many standout features that made me love one more than the other. The Pixel Watch 2 is a solid smartwatch, but so is the Series 9, so &mdash; again &mdash; it really depends on what phone you&rsquo;re using.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as activity trackers go, Fitbit had one semi-critical feature missing, at least for fellow gym rats: most of its lineup isn&rsquo;t compatible with exercise equipment, aside from the Charge 6. This means you can&rsquo;t connect any of your Fitbit devices &mdash; including the Google Pixel Watch 2 &mdash; to gym equipment (treadmills, stationary bikes, etc.) to view/sync data like heart rate, calories burned, and distance. Meanwhile, this is a baseline feature in Apple Watches &mdash; even my old Series 4 connects to compatible equipment at the gym using NFC functionality &mdash; which made it all the more surprising to discover that Fitbit skipped that feature.</p><p>Is it a dealbreaker? Probably not for most people, but it&rsquo;s a feature I&rsquo;ve really loved using on my Apple Watch, so not having it felt weird.</p><p><strong>Winner: Apple Watch</strong></p><h2>Apple Watch vs. Fitbit: The verdict</h2><p>It&rsquo;s not exactly the flashiest answer, but the clear winner between Apple Watch and Fitbit depends on you. If you&rsquo;re looking for a simple fitness tracker, the best Fitbit watch is likely the Charge 6. It packs a powerful punch into a tiny device &mdash; including health and fitness tracking, sleep tracking, built-in GPS, and more &mdash; while boasting a great battery life and a solid price tag.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re more interested in a quality smartwatch, then get whatever works with your phone. The Apple Watch is a fantastic choice that&rsquo;s both functional and durable, but the Google Pixel Watch 2 is shaping up to be a decent competitor.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

      <description><![CDATA[The CEO of digital marketing agency LANDE discusses how dyslexia affected his career in tech.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04Xmwmxs6eNLOrsRU0lcqXb/hero-image.jpg" alt="A busy office setting."><p>When I was growing up, I didn&rsquo;t realize I had <a href="https://dyslexiaida.org/dyslexia-basics/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">dyslexia</a>. I just knew I wasn&rsquo;t keeping up with other kids. I&rsquo;d struggle with reading and math, but didn&rsquo;t think much of it until my mom told me I&rsquo;d be switching schools to get extra help.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, I was just a kindergartener, confused about why I had to leave my friends behind and go to a place called the Julie Billiard School in Lyndhurst, Ohio. </p><p>At Julie Billiard, I began to realize that my brain simply processed things differently. I could learn, but it took me longer to master things than everyone around me. What took my classmates two weeks might take me six. I remember my pulse increasing and my muscles growing tense, frustration storming throughout my body.&nbsp;</p><p>But over time, I recognized a pattern emerging; I was slower to start, but once I grasped something, I would soar past others. I could also keep learning long after my peers had moved on, and my understanding of a topic would often go much deeper. This realization was a game-changer.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than viewing dyslexia as a limitation, I started to see it as an advantage. Dyslexia taught me patience and discipline. I learned not to compare myself to others because I realized my learning curve was simply different.</p><p>This approach has been critical in my career as the founder and CEO of <a href="https://thelande.com/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">LANDE</a>, a digital marketing agency. In the tech world, where systems, coding, and problem-solving are prerequisites, the ability to break things down and understand the process separate the swimmers from the sinkers.</p><p>Coding, for instance, requires giving a computer precise instructions &mdash; an "ingredient list," if you will. You have to think about every step.</p><p>Take something simple, like making toast. Most people would say, "Grab the bread, put it in the toaster, and hit the button." But for me, my brain immediately goes into process mode. I think about opening the cupboard with my right hand, grabbing the bread, and if there&rsquo;s no bread, I&rsquo;ll plan a trip to the store. And that involves grabbing my keys with my right hand, opening the door, going into the garage, walking toward the car, and well &hellip; you get the idea.&nbsp;</p><p>Dyslexia has also made me a better teacher. I&rsquo;ve had to learn everything so thoroughly that when I explain it to others, I can break it down into easily digestible pieces.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether it&rsquo;s coding, paid advertising, or even accounting, I know how to guide someone through&nbsp;the process because I&rsquo;ve had to master each step myself. This skill has been crucial in scaling LANDE, where creating systems and standard operating procedures (SOPs) is crucial for growth.</p><p>As dyslexics, we can solve problems better because we can see all the steps from start to finish and from finish to start. It helps me with being able to forward think and calculate different scenarios. It&rsquo;s just how my brain works. And if you have dyslexia or know someone who does, it&rsquo;s an important aspect to understand. Because, after all, many people with my condition are underestimated.</p><p>But you have to ignore the naysayers. I remember my high school guidance counselor looking at my grades and suggesting I avoid a career in tech. If I had taken her advice, I wouldn&rsquo;t be where I am today.&nbsp;</p><p>My advice to anyone with dyslexia is simple: Be patient with yourself.&nbsp;Learning might take longer, but when it clicks, it clicks. And once you understand something, your ability to build on that knowledge can outpace those around you.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The Apple and OpenAI partnership was <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-openai-chatgpt-integration-announced-wwdc-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">announced</a> last summer's WWDC which unveiled Apple's suite of AI tools called Apple Intelligence. Through the partnership, iPhone users can connect with ChatGPT as an extension of specific tasks. Apple already kind of stole limelight by <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-ios-18-2-apple-intelligence" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">announcing</a> the release of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2 earlier today, including the much-anticipated <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ios-18-2-release-apple-intelligence-features" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">support of ChatGPT</a> in the announcement. </p><p>But in the livestream, CEO Sam Altman, joined by engineering manager Dave Cummings and product manager Miqdad Jaffer demoed some of the ways to use ChatGPT with iOS 18 and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-intelligence-mac-5-ai-powered-features" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">macOS Sequoia 15.2</a>. Taking a picture on an iPhone, they showed how iPhone 16's Camera Control uses visual intelligence with ChatGPT to answer questions about an image. Cummings then opened a Mac and demonstrated how to use type to Siri to ask a question about a document. Siri then gave the option to send the query to ChatGPT, which provided a response, including a visual breakdown of the request. </p><p>The ChatGPT integration isn't a surprise like some of the other announcements as part of OpenAI's ongoing livestream series, which so far has seen a new ChatGPT Pro plan for $200 a month and its AI video generator Sora. This was expected with the latest Apple software updates, so today's news wasn't so much an unveiling as a confirmation of what we already expected. To be fair, OpenAI <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1864328928267259941" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">did say</a> its 12 days of livestreams would be a mix of "new things, big and small."</p><p>That's day five down, seven more to go. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This tiny powerhouse fits in the palm of your hand, but can get as loud as a larger speaker without losing much clarity. The fourth-generation speaker has less muddiness than the previous one, especially at higher volumes, as well as an Outdoor Boost Mode and Podcast Mode. Plus, it has a new USB-C port for easy charging. Otherwise, it's pretty much identical to the Wonderboom 3 (which we also loved). Like its predecessor, the Wonderboom 4 can survive drops from up to five feet and plunges into water for up to 30 minutes (thanks to an IP67 rating). It also packs a healthy battery life of 14 hours. </p><p>The only reason we'd pass on this speaker is if you already own the Wonderboom 3. Otherwise, at 40% off, we can't recommend the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a0XyD3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Wonderboom%204&object_type=article&object_uuid=05LZhLnGw6nFLEjXMoCY06K&short_url=a0XyD3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wonderboom 4</a> enough.

<p>These buds are a great option for both iOS and Android users, so don't let the Samsung branding scare you off. They're lightweight and comfortable in-ear with a design similar to AirPods and offer active noise cancellation with Galaxy AI power, so they can automatically adapt to your surroundings. They can also help you converse with others in different languages as they have the Real-Time Interpreter feature powered by said Galaxy AI. </p><p>Control your buds with their on-board touch controls and use the adaptive equalizer to customize their sound to your liking. Whether you choose to enjoy your music, calls, or podcasts, you can fine-tune your audio to fit the situation. Even if you're just bopping to your favorite playlist, making the smallest adjustments can make a difference. </p><p>If you're looking for an easy gift for an audiophile or just want a quick upgrade for yourself, these buds are worth picking up, especially with an additional $20 credit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gemini 2.0 Flash is described in the announcement as a "workhorse model" for developers, capable of powerful performance at scale. Flash supports image and audio generation, has native integration with Google Search, can write code, and works with third-party apps. Alongside the Gemini 2.0 Flash announcement, Google also introduced <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-adds-deep-research-gemini-browsing-the-web-on-your-behalf" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Deep Research</a>, a Gemini feature that browses the web and compiles research reports based on the initial prompt. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-Fs0t6SdODd8&amp;ab_channel=Google"></div>
</div>


<p>Gemini 2.0 Flash is a step up from Gemini 1.0 in that has improved reasoning, longer context windows, ability to understand complex instructions, and native tool use &mdash; all of which has been designed to make the model more agentic, in other words capable of executing multi-step tasks on the user's behalf. </p><p>As part of this, Google said Gemini 2.0 would be available for Project Astra, a research prototype for testing a universal AI assistant. Google also shared other research prototypes: Project Mariner, which is specifically designed to explore "human-agent interaction," and Project Jules for developers. </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Gemini 2.0 Flash is available as an "experimental model" via the Gemini API which can be accessed in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. But casual users can also try out its improved chat capabilities in the Gemini desktop app, with mobile app support coming soon. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The 10th generation iPad may not be the fanciest iPad in the Apple ecosystem, but it's the most affordable current model &mdash;&nbsp;and that certainly matters for something. It offers a powerful A14 Bionic chip, a Liquid Retina display, and comes in a variety of colors. However, only the silver option is left in stock at the time of writing. In our <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-ipads" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best iPad roundup</a>, Mashable shopping reporter Sam Mangino writes, "It's perfect for someone who wants a portable screen for streaming, playing games, and reading. It's also a nice choice if you're interested in using your tablet as a laptop but don't want to spend a ton of money." Usually $349, it's on sale for just $279 as of Dec. 11. That's 20% in savings and just $20 shy of its record-low.</p><h2>Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0 with Stand</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>A step up from the basic Kindle Kids, the Kindle Paperwhite Kids is our <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-kindles" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">favorite option</a> for little readers. The newest version, <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-kindle-color-scribe-paperwhite-entry" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">released in October</a>, comes in its thinnest, fastest form yet &mdash; and in a variety of new designs. The seven-inch display also packs a higher contrast ratio and 25 percent faster page turns. Otherwise, it's still the Paperwhite Kids we know and love, with a waterproof build, two-year worry-free guarantee, and six months of Amazon Kids+ included. It's usually $179.99, which we find to be a bit steep, but as of Dec. 11, it's down to $144.99 at Amazon. That's just shy of 20% in savings.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

<p>The Onion, owned by media conglomerate Global Tetrahedron, snagged auction rights to InfoWars last month with a sealed bid totaling roughly $1.7 million in cash and an additional noncash component that brought the offer closer to $7 million. That figure still fell short of a competing $3.5 million bid from Jones&rsquo; associates at First United American Companies, which helps market the supplements frequently advertised on InfoWars.</p><p>However, after reviewing the numbers, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez said even the higher offer might not have been enough. In a ruling that tossed out The Onion&rsquo;s attempt to finalize the deal, Lopez made it clear that InfoWars could command a bigger payout.</p><p>"I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s enough money," Lopez said in his ruling. "I&rsquo;m not going to approve the sale&hellip; I think you&rsquo;ve got to go out and try to get every dollar. I think that the process fell down."</p><p><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/10/12/alex-jones-sandy-hook-shooting/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">In the fallout of a colossal $1.2 billion defamation judgment</a>&nbsp;by families of the Sandy Hook shooting victims, Alex Jones has been forced into bankruptcy, and his signature platform, InfoWars, has landed on the auction block. But following a judge&rsquo;s decision to reject The Onion&rsquo;s bid &mdash; one initially expected to clinch the deal &mdash; Jones might be getting a shot at retaking control.</p><p>Ben Collins, the former disinformation reporter now heading Global Tetrahedron, isn't giving up. In a post on X, he vowed to keep chasing InfoWars, declaring that he'll "seek a path towards purchasing InfoWars in the coming weeks."</p><p>For now, though, the entire process is stuck in a holding pattern. Lopez handed the keys back to the court-appointed trustee, Christopher Murray, faulting him for mishandling the previous auction. Murray must now figure out a new game plan to sell off InfoWars.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"It's these kinds of journeys where you're going to have to open many tabs and spend quite a lot of time hunting for information, and we really wanted to help speed up the process of going from like zero to 60 in a new topic, fast," said Gemini Senior Product Manager Aarush Selvan, during a demo for Mashable. </p><p>Google's Deep Research tool is indicative of the next phase of generative AI where models can execute multi-step tasks on the user's behalf. Anthropic's Claude has a programming feature that can <a href="https://mashable.com/article/anthtopic-claude-computer-use-ai" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">take over your cursor</a> and conduct computing tasks like clicking and typing.

OpenAI is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-reportedly-working-ai-agent-slated-january-release" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">rumored</a> to be releasing an AI agent for coding and web browsing. Google is also <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-accidentally-leaked-new-ai-tool-browses-internet-for-you" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">reportedly</a> working on a Chrome feature for similar web-browsing capabilities. All of these features have agentic AI properties that push generative AI towards autonomous behavior.</p><p>Deep Research starts by outlining a research plan for how it's going to compile information &ndash; genAI's way of showing its work. When you hit start, it gets to work browsing the web on your behalf and finding relevant information. Once it's finished, the new report opens up in a new canvas that shows citations that you can click into. You can also ask follow up questions or ask for specific edits like adding new sections of information. Plus, you can open the report in Google Docs, which is a useful perk. </p><div class="giphy-embed">

<p>The feature works off of the existing Google Search architecture. So it's essentially doing a bunch of googling for you and compiling what you might have found on the web &mdash; just way faster. Since it leans on Google Search, Deep Research also inherits its rules around restricted or banned content, so it won't read adult sites or sites that violate its policies said Selvan.</p><p>Selvan also explained that Deep Research can't access websites that require a login, like many social media sites, and also can't bypass paywalled sites. When asked about how the feature responds to sites that block web crawlers, a spokesperson said, "Deep Research currently will not use any URLs opted out via Google-Extended to generate the research reports." <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-extended-crawler-432636" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Google-extended</a> is the web crawler that Gemini uses to scrape sites for training data. </p><p>Deep Research is live today for Gemini Advanced, which costs $20 a month.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/alienware-m16-r2" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Read Mashable's full review of the Alienware m16 R2.</em></a></p><p>Former Mashable Tech Editor Kimberly Gedeon was impressed by this 16-incher's mid-range performance and build quality, especially its "super clicky" keyboard. She also liked its inclusion of a Stealth mode hotkey to dial back its RGB lighting, and its support of Nvidia Advanced Optimus for automatic GPU switching depending on the task. (There's an MUX switch to do it manually, too.) "The Alienware m16 R2 blends portability and power to deliver a laptop that can handle both play and work," she wrote. It snagged a 4.5/5 rating and a Mashable Choice Award.</p><p>The model Gedeon tested featured an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor, RTX 4070 graphics, 16GB of memory, and 1TB of storage. It's currently on sale for $1,499.99 at Best Buy (normally $1,899.99). That's not quite as good as its Black Friday price of $1,299.99, but $400 off is still pretty decent. For reference, that same discount made it sell out on <a href="https://zdcs.link/9g34Ay?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Dell%27s%20website&object_type=article&object_uuid=07b7lettnjVEd0NOOg0KXO2&short_url=9g34Ay&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Dell's website</a> earlier in the week; it's now back in stock there, but it doesn't ship until late December.</p><h2>Best budget pick</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>If convenience and portability are your top priorities, then the Air will be most suited to you. It's thin and light, and it even comes in a 13-inch option if you'll be lugging it around wherever you go. Plus, ever since the debut of Apple's M Series chips, the MacBook Air has become a pint-sized powerhouse. The <a href="https://mashable.com/review/m3-macbook-air-15-inch" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">most current model</a> utilizes the M3 chip, so you won't be sacrificing all that much in terms of power.</p><h2>Which generation MacBook is the best?</h2><p>This will come down to what you're willing to give up in performance, and in some cases, quality. But, whatever you <em>do</em> deem worthy of sacrificing, you'll be paid back in savings. For example, the 2022 model M2 MacBook Air won't come with the latest chip, but you'll still be scoring an impressive laptop that frequently goes on sale <a href="https://zdcs.link/no4kb?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=for%20just%20%24849.99&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=02kXuJMwbksWlejvwAatSB2&short_url=no4kb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">for just $849.99</a>.

<p>First up is <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, a mind-bending puzzle game with a mildly alliterative title that&rsquo;s fun to say aloud.&nbsp;</p><p>The less said about this game before you hop into it yourself, the better. All you need to know is that this puzzle game is set inside a black-and-white mansion with fixed camera angles that call back to classic horror games like the original <em>Resident Evil</em>, though you won&rsquo;t be shooting any zombies here. Instead, you'll solve puzzles. Lots of them. Puzzles will have puzzles inside of them, and they&rsquo;ll all lead to more puzzles.&nbsp;</p><p>You may need to have a notepad next to you while you play. It&rsquo;s that kind of game. Have fun!</p><h2><em>Ys X: Nordics</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>Ys X: Nordics</em> isn't technically an indie game like most of the other titles on this list. It comes from a noted Japanese development studio in Falcom, and the <em>Ys</em> series of action RPGs has been around for as long as <em>Final Fantasy</em>. It just doesn't have the same level of prestige, especially in the West. <em>Ys</em> deserves it, though, and selfishly, I want other people I know to play it so I can talk to them about it.</p><p><em>Ys X</em> takes the kind of fast-paced, no-thoughts-head-empty action combat the series is known for and adds tactical, defensive layers on top of it to make it deeper and feel more novel than its immediate predecessors. Series protagonist Adol Christin (he's just a guy who loves adventure and has no other personality traits to speak of) is joined on this adventure by a cool Viking lady named Karja, and together, the two of them sail the high seas trying to break an evil curse, among other things.</p><p>It's got great music, an eminently satisfying upgrade loop, and the best seafaring ship combat this side of <em>Assassin's Creed</em>. Don&rsquo;t miss this one.</p><h2><em>Tiny Terry&rsquo;s Turbo Trip</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I love video games that you can finish in just one or two sittings. I also love the PlayStation 2-era open-world classic <em>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Tiny Terry&rsquo;s Turbo Trip</em> takes only a few hours to complete. You play as a goofy little guy running around a goofy, open-ended town, completing tasks to upgrade his car and ultimately fly to space. Like <em>Hit &amp; Run</em>, it&rsquo;s a lighthearted, cartoony, open-world driving adventure with very low stakes and an endearing sense of humor. It's a perfect <a href="https://mashable.com/review/steam-deck-oled" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Steam Deck</u></a> game, too.

It spans several eras of classic game design, from obtuse 8-bit adventures to RPGs and more. <em>UFO 50</em> is a celebration of what games used to be and paints a positive view of what games can be in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Just check it out, will ya?</p><h2><em>1000xResist</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>1000xResist</em> is another one where the less you know going in, the better.</p><p>Just know that this unique sci-fi adventure game trades more in compelling narrative than deep mechanics.

<p>Set in a fake town in northern England, <em>Thank Goodness You&rsquo;re Here</em> is a self-described "absurd comedy slapformer" about a traveling salesman who bounces around town, performing random tasks for people and, more generally, just having a silly little time.&nbsp;</p><p>There's not much else to say about <em>Thank Goodness You&rsquo;re Here</em>, another game that can be completed in one sitting.

<p>So far, the games on this list have mostly been skewed more lightheartedly or narrative-focused. <em>I Am Your Beast</em> is not those things, necessarily.</p><p>But it <em>is</em> a sick, stylish comic book-like first-person shooter set across a series of tiny sandboxes full of fun and violent ways of dispatching your foes. Want to take guys out by drop-kicking their faces or throwing bear traps at them? Go right ahead. Of course, you can also use guns, but there's more fun in being creative.</p><h2><em>Minishoot Adventures</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>"What if <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> was an arcade-style shooter?" is the elevator pitch for <em>Minishoot Adventures</em>, and it's a strong one. This simple little game marries the twin-stick action of many a classic arcade game with adventure games' more exploratory, puzzle-solving elements.&nbsp;</p><p>If that quick elevator pitch doesn't grab you, this might not be your game. But if it does, you should probably check this one out.</p><h2><em>Caravan Sandwitch</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I love open-world games, but I also love games with low stakes. These two genres don&rsquo;t meet often enough, but when they do, good things happen.&nbsp;</p><p>Enter <em>Caravan Sandwitch</em>, an open-world adventure set on an alien planet with a small community of eccentric humans for you to hang out with and do stuff for. Almost all of the gameplay in <em>Caravan Sandwitch</em> involves driving a van around a desert and exploring ruins to find scrap and other valuables. Along the way, you&rsquo;ll uncover a narrative underpinning the whole thing, making the journey worthwhile.</p><p>If you like the exploration of <em>Zelda</em> but don&rsquo;t want to worry about pesky things like combat or failure, this is the game for you.</p><h2><em>Rise of the Golden Idol</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The sequel to 2022's <em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> is yet another macabre tribute to PC adventure games of old. </p><p>You'll use your detective skills to solve a series of 1970s-themed cases with stylish visuals that can occasionally veer into disturbing territory. Fans of classic adventure games will surely find something to love here.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Looking to upgrade your recording setup without emptying your wallet? The Shure SM4 studio recording microphone is your new go-to. Whether you&rsquo;re a streamer, podcaster, or musician, this microphone delivers mix-ready sound at a price that won&rsquo;t make you wince. Right now, it&rsquo;s available for $199 at <a href="https://mashable.com/comparison/amazon-music-vs-spotify" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon</a> &mdash; a solid $70 off its usual $269.99 price when you buy the kit with accessories.</p><p>So, what makes the SM4 so special? First, it reproduces audio smoothly. Thanks to a 1-inch dual-diaphragm capsule, this mic ensures clean, natural sound with detailed highs and controlled low-end frequencies. Translation: whether whispering or belting out a ballad, your audio comes through crystal clear.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Another standout feature is the cardioid polar pattern, which minimizes background noise while keeping your voice (or instrument) front and centre. Got a loud guitar amp? No problem. SM4 can handle sound pressure levels of up to 140 decibels without breaking a sweat. Hence, you get distortion-free recordings no matter how loud things get.</p><p>For those who want minimal fuss in post-production, the SM4&rsquo;s integrated pop filter and shielding against RF interference ensure your recordings are clean from the start. It&rsquo;s designed to reject unwanted plosives, rumbles, and even interference from your phone or WiFi, leaving you with a professional-grade sound straight out of the box.</p><p>And let&rsquo;s not forget Shure&rsquo;s legendary durability. Built with rugged, all-metal construction, the SM4 is made to last whether it&rsquo;s parked in your home studio or on the road. Add a sleek, low-profile design that won&rsquo;t hog the spotlight in your video shoots, and you&rsquo;ve got a mic that&rsquo;s as versatile as it is reliable.</p><p>Need accessories? Go for the $269 kit, which includes a pop filter and shock mount for added recording convenience. But if you&rsquo;re happy with the basics, the mic-only option at $199 is worth grabbing while it lasts.</p><p>Bottom line: The Shure SM4 mic doesn&rsquo;t just talk the talk &mdash; it lets you do it better. If you&rsquo;re ready to level up your audio game, snag this deal from <a href="https://mashable.com/comparison/amazon-music-vs-apple-music" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon</a> before it&rsquo;s gone.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If your audio setup is feeling a little tired, the PSB Alpha iQ streaming-powered speakers are here to shake things up. These wireless speakers, now $1,234 for <a href="https://mashable.com/comparison/amazon-music-vs-apple-music" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime members on Amazon</a> (a $65 saving), bring high-res sound and zero cable chaos to your home.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with the basics: These aren&rsquo;t just speakers but a full-on streaming system in disguise. Thanks to BluOS, the Alpha iQ connects you to over 20 music services, including high-resolution platforms like <a href="https://mashable.com/deals/dec-8-tidal-best-buy" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Tidal</a> and Qobuz. Want to stream directly from your phone? These speakers play nice with AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect, and Tidal Connect, so you can ditch the extra gadgets.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>But it&rsquo;s not just about convenience, it&rsquo;s about sound quality that can make even a so-so playlist feel savage. Alpha iQ boasts an audiophile-grade DAC (digital-to-analogue converter) with support for 24-bit/192kHz high-res audio and MQA decoding. You can hear every pluck, beat, and whisper like it&rsquo;s happening live. The speakers pack a punch, too, with each woofer powered by a 60-watt amp and each tweeter rocking its own 30-watt amp. That&rsquo;s 180 watts of system power delivering room-filling sound that doesn&rsquo;t skimp on the details.</p><p>Need flexibility? These speakers have you covered. Beyond streaming features, the primary speaker has inputs, including an MM phono preamp and RCA jacks for vinyl lovers, an HDMI ARC port for hooking up to your TV, and an optical input for gamers or old-school CD enthusiasts. There&rsquo;s even a 3.5mm auxiliary jack for analogue devices because PSB knows some of us still love a classic.</p><p>Alpha iQ speakers come in a range of finishes, including matte white, black, and midnight blue that look modern without trying. They&rsquo;ll sit pretty in your living room or home office without screaming, &ldquo;look at me!&rdquo;</p><p>Sure, $1,234 isn&rsquo;t precisely bargain-bin pricing, but you&rsquo;re paying for quality and not having to fiddle with wires. If you&rsquo;ve been craving a speaker upgrade that blends style, tech, and next-level audio performance, now&rsquo;s your chance to snag the Alpha iQ at a discount. Just don&rsquo;t sleep on it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A lot has changed since the Kindle first debuted in 2007. While it was released just a few months after the first <a href="https://mashable.com/category/iphone" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone</a>, the Amazon Kindle has received fewer updates.

<h2>When is the best time to buy a Kindle?</h2><p>Because Kindles are one of Amazon's cornerstone products, you'll often see their prices drop during Amazon's annual sales, which usually take place in the summer and fall of each year. In 2024, Prime Day took place on July 16 and 17, and Prime Big Deal Days ran Oct. 8 and 9.</p><p>The next shopping holidays you should focus on are Black Friday and Cyber Monday. On these momentous occasions, we've seen Kindles marked down by up to 40%. We even saw the brand-new 2024 Kindle models drop in price during Cyber Week this year.</p><p>We're seeing a few Kindles continue to run sales up to 19% off into mid-December. So if you missed Black Friday, there's still a chance.</p><h2>What is the right Kindle to buy?</h2><p>If you're concerned about buying the newest tech, that's not an issue. As of December 2024, there are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-leak" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">six updated Kindle models</a> to choose from, as well as older editions that might still be in stock. The Kindle Scribe was the latest to get a revamp in December and we'll update this guide when we get a chance to test the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aep0VA?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=new%20model&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=075BHRyIknVFjS6g55iHeyI&short_url=aep0VA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">new model</a>. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You can consider many things when picking the right Kindle, but you need to ask one question first: Do you need it to be waterproof? If you prefer reading near a body of water &mdash; whether in the bath, by the pool, or at the beach &mdash; that immediately narrows down your options. Among the Kindles, your waterproof options are the Kindle Paperwhite, Paperwhite Signature Edition, Colorsoft Signature Edition, and Paperwhite Kids.</p><p>Beyond whether or not you need a waterproof device, here are a few other things to consider: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Display size:</strong> The smallest Kindle has a 6-inch display, while the largest has a 10.2-inch display.</p></li><li><p><strong>Storage capacity:</strong> Kindles range from 16GB to 32GB of storage capacity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Battery life:</strong> Kindles generally have outstanding battery life (depending on your usage). On the low end, they last up to six weeks per charge, while others last up to 12 weeks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Writing capability: </strong>The Kindle Scribe is the only model that allows you to write with the included pen.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>The latest Kindles all boast a maximum brightness of 94 nits and a 300 ppi, high-resolution display with zero glare, so you can enjoy sharp text and images at any viewing angle. Kindles are also equipped with WiFi connectivity, allowing you to download all the reading material you could ever want. Plus, you can listen to audiobooks on Audible via any Kindle's built-in Bluetooth connection.</p><p>Not to mention, out of all the e-readers I've tested, Kindles have the best compatibility with Libby. I love the digital platform because I can read for free and support my local library. Some other e-readers require you to download your library e-book to a computer and then upload it to an e-reader, but with Kindles, your e-books are sent straight to your device with a click.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/07EZRs8RHxOS22JNQVMfmGc/hero-image.jpg" alt="NordVPN on phone"><p>The <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best VPNs</a> aren't necessarily the most expensive. Some leading <a href="https://mashable.com/category/vpn" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPNs</a> are actually really affordable, which is great news for anyone looking to secure cheap online security, data protection, and increased <a href="https://mashable.com/category/streaming" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">streaming</a> options.</p><p>You have come to the right place if you're looking for a <a href="https://mashable.com/category/vpn" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">premium VPN</a> with advanced features, without the big price tag. We've lined up some great value options for absolutely everyone, and there is no need to compromise on security, connection speed, customer support, or anything else.</p><p>But first, there are a few things we need to cover.</p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-anonymity-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Virtual Private Networks</u></a> (VPNs) provide valuable protection for your data and identity when you're navigating the online world. How do they do this? VPNs offer online privacy and anonymity by creating a private network that hides your real IP address and makes all of your information unreadable. </p><p>All of your activity is untraceable and secure, because your online traffic passes through an encrypted tunnel. Everything inside the tunnel is protected against online threats like viruses, hackers, and malware. VPNs are primarily designed to provide online security, but there is another reason that millions of people use these services.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>VPNs can also be used to <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-streaming-movies-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">stream movies and shows</a> from around the world, and the process is actually really simple. We've already mentioned how VPNs provide anonymity by hiding your real IP address. Well, this technique can also be used to manipulate the streaming market. By hiding your real IP address and connecting you to a server in another location, you can trick your favourite streaming sites into thinking that you are based in a different country. This provides access to all the extra content that would normally be restricted in your location.</p><h2>Should you use free VPNs?</h2><p>The question that everyone wants an answer to is whether you actually need to pay for a VPN. There are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-reviews-paid-free" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">free VPNs</a> out there, but do these offer the features you need to browse, shop, and stream securely? Unfortunately, there is often a catch with free versions (usually in the form of a limitation on your data usage or connection speed). </p><p>Occasional users will probably be satisfied with a free VPN, but if you're going to be streaming or downloading on a regular basis, you should look elsewhere. The only exception to this rule is a free trial. These come without limitations, but obviously don't tend to last for a long time.</p><p>The conclusion is that the best option for securing your data and streaming more content from around the world is with a paid subscription. The sad fact is that you'll have to pay to gain access to advanced security features without limitations on your usage. It's not all bad news though, because there are plenty of cheap plans out there, especially if you're willing to commit to a lengthy contract.</p><h2>What should you consider before subscribing to a VPN?</h2><p>The process of actually selecting a VPN can be seriously tricky, especially if you don't know what to consider. Most of the best VPNs offer many of the same features with similar packages, so it's important to know what matters.</p><p>To make your life a little bit easier, we have shortlisted a few things to consider before making any sort of decision:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Customer support</strong> &mdash; VPNs can be difficult to understand if you're not an experienced user, and even if you are, problems can occur. Whether you're a total beginner or not, customer support is key for dealing with any potential issues that might arise. You should also consider whether customer support is offered by phone, email, or web chat. </p></li><li><p><strong>Jurisdiction</strong> &mdash; It's a good idea to look for VPNs based in the British Virgin Islands, Panama, Switzerland, and other <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-no-log-vpn-services-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">privacy-friendly countries</a>. VPNs based in countries that fall under the jurisdiction of the intelligence-sharing alliances should be avoided: the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, France, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and Spain. VPNs in these countries can be forced by authorities to collect and hand over user data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network size and location</strong> &mdash; The best VPNs offer a large network of geographically diverse servers. The more servers (and server locations) offered by a VPN, the more likely you are to find a reliable and fast connection. This is also particularly important for streaming, as you should always be able to connect to a server in the country with the content you want to watch.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trustworthiness</strong> &mdash; We recommend finding an experienced provider with a strong track record and a clear privacy policy. It's important that your VPN of choice guarantees your data won't be logged or collected. If it isn't obvious what happens to your data, you should steer clear.</p></li></ul><p>Make sure you carefully consider these features before deciding on the VPN that suits you and your lifestyle. Once you have narrowed down your options, you can begin the process of finding the best deals.</p><h2>What is the best VPN?</h2><p>We're sorry to burst your bubble, but there isn't one VPN that stands above all the rest. The best VPN for you really comes down to your own set of personal preferences. Once you find a few options that tick your boxes, you need to consider the <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best deals</a>.</p><p>We have reached out to partners in order to provide you with market-leading prices on VPN subscriptions, with performance and security in mind. All of these VPN services have been handpicked not only because of the prices and deals on offer, but because they all offer the most important features to protect your online data and identity.</p><p>There are also plenty of services to consider on this list if your priority is unlocking streaming sites like <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-netflix" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/category/amazon-prime-video" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Video</a>, and Disney+. Online security should always be the priority, but we know that many subscribers use these services to unlock more content from around the world. We get it, and we're here to help.</p><p>These are the best deals on cheap VPNs in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Those users are part of a "Likeness pilot" that OpenAI is testing with a select few. An OpenAI spokesperson said AI-generated videos of people is limited in order to "address concerns around misappropriation of likeness and deepfakes." OpenAI "will actively monitor patterns of misuse, and when we find it we will remove the content, take appropriate action with users, and use these early learnings to iterate on our approach to safety," the spokesperson continued. </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Limiting the depiction of people in Sora videos makes sense from a liability standpoint. There are all sorts of ways the tool could be misused: non-consensual deepfakes, the depiction of minors, scams, and misinformation to name a few. To combat this, Sora has been trained to reject certain requests from text prompts or image uploads. </p><p>It will reject prompts for NSFW (Not Safe For Work) and NCII (Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery) content and the generation of realistic children, although fictitious images are allowed. OpenAI has added C2PA metadata to all Sora videos and made a visible watermark the default, even though it can be removed, and implemented an internal reverse image search to assess the video's provenance. </p><p>Despite the fact that many guardrails have been put in place to prevent misuse, the question of how Sora will respond to mass stress-testing remains.

Additionally, users can run python code inside a canvas document, and canvas is also available for custom GPTs. </p><p>Canvas was introduced in October as a editing tool for writing and coding. It's a notebook interface that sits beside the user's ChatGPT chatbot conversation, which allows users to edit responses and "collaborate" with ChatGPT.

<p>OpenAI has also made programming improvements. By copying and pasting code into ChatGPT, it can recognize the code and switch to code editor mode to help debug or find any errors. Users can also run the code directly within the interface and identify any problems. </p><p>Today's announcement was the fourth day of "12 Days of OpenAI" where every business day, the AI company shares something new. So far, we've seen the introduction of a ChatGPT Pro plan for $200 a month, reinforcement fine-tuning for developers, and of course, Sora. </p><p>The Sora release has been the biggest news so far, courting hype and controversy ever since its introduction last February. The AI video generator is capable of rendering photorealistic sequences from simple text prompts and has new features for editing AI-generated footage. OpenAI says it was trained on publicly available data, although critics argue data <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-sora-ai-video-generator-training-data" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">should have been obtained</a> with credit and compensation of the original creators. </p><p>Sora's debut continues to attract lots of attention online, which has overshadowed some of the more minor releases like the Canvas announcement.

<p>The company has retained tight control over its iCloud product and user libraries as part of its wider privacy promises. In 2022, Apple <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-photo-scanning-csam-communication-safety-messages/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">scrapped its plans</a> for a controversial tool that would automatically scan and flag iCloud photo libraries for abusive or problematic material, including CSAM. The company cited growing concern over user privacy and mass surveillance by Big Tech in its choice to no longer introduce the scanning feature, and Apple's choice was widely supported by privacy groups and activists around the world. But the new lawsuit argues that the tech giant merely used this cybersecurity defense to skirt its reporting duties.</p><p>"Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and we are committed to fighting the ways predators put children at risk," wrote Apple spokesperson Fred Sainz in response to the lawsuit. "We are urgently and actively innovating to combat these crimes without compromising the security and privacy of all our users. Features like Communication Safety, for example, warn children when they receive or attempt to send content that contains nudity to help break the chain of coercion that leads to child sexual abuse. We remain deeply focused on building protections that help prevent the spread of CSAM before it starts."</p><p>Tech companies have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/28/us/child-sex-abuse.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">struggled to control</a> the spread of abusive material online.

Competitors Google and Meta reported more than 1 million and 30 million cases, respectively. Meanwhile, growing concern over the rise of digitally-altered or synthetic CSAM has complicated the regulatory landscape, leaving tech giants and social media platforms racing to catch up. </p><p>While Apple faces a potential billion-dollar lawsuit should the suit move to and be favored by a jury, the decision has even wider repercussions for the industry and privacy efforts at large. The court could decide to force Apple into reviving its photo library scanning tool or implement other industry features to remove abusive content, paving a more direct path toward government surveillance and wielding another blow to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/section-230-explained-youtube-twitter-supreme-court" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Section 230</a> protections. </p>]]></content:encoded>

So much so that Google has compiled a list of the 10 most hummed songs in the US and worldwide, a perfect nod to all of us who can&rsquo;t shake that earworm and need a little help identifying it.</p><p>Here's the top 3:</p><h2>1. "Beautiful Things" by Benson Boone</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-Oa_RSwwpPaA"></div>
</div>


<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that Benson Boone&rsquo;s pop ballad clinched the number one spot on both the US and global top 10 Hum to Search lists. The Washington-raised singer-songwriter went viral on TikTok this year during the rollout and release of <em>&ldquo;Beautiful Things,&rdquo;</em> amassing over 4.1 million videos created with the track.</p><p>With more than 1.6 billion streams on Spotify, <em>&ldquo;Beautiful Things&rdquo;</em> has become one of the year&rsquo;s most-played songs, even earning Boone a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist. It&rsquo;s easy to see why this track has been stuck in so many heads.</p><h2>2. "Axel F" by Crazy Frog</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-k85mRPqvMbE"></div>
</div>


<p>The Crazy Frog remix of &ldquo;Axel F&rdquo; had its moment back in the quirky days of 2005 (not to make you feel old, but I was seven then). However, thanks to a wave of nostalgia sparked by Netflix for the release of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/beverly-hills-cop-4-axel-f" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F</em></a>, the viral hit has made a surprising comeback.</p><p>To be fair, it was the best-selling ringtone of its time and has somehow maintained its odd cultural grip on Americans, at least. Strangely enough, &ldquo;Axel F&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t manage to secure a spot in the global top 10.</p><h2>3. "Wellerman" by Santiano</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-83TbpdckFzE"></div>
</div>


<p>TikTok has been obsessed with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC8F6IFQS4A" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">&ldquo;Wellerman&rdquo; and other sea shanties for a couple of years</a>, but it&rsquo;s surprising to see Santiano&rsquo;s version of &ldquo;Wellerman&rdquo; break into the top three. The popular New Zealand folk song first went viral in 2021 after Scottish singer Nathan Evans&rsquo;s cover, sparking hundreds of subsequent renditions.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>It seems that, much like how Pandora operates, Google&rsquo;s Hum to Search feature relies on its database for matches. As a result, the German band Santiano gets the recognition for a viral trend that might otherwise have pointed to someone else.</p><p>Rounding out the rest of the list we have:</p><p><strong>4. Past Lives - sapientdream &amp; Slushii</strong></p><p><strong>5. Too Sweet - Hozier</strong></p><p><strong>6. Die With A Smile - Lady Gaga &amp; Bruno Mars</strong></p><p><strong>7. Lovely - Billie Eilish</strong></p><p><strong>8. Thick Of It - KSI</strong></p><p><strong>9. Not Like Us - Kendrick Lamar</strong></p><p><strong>10. Dubidubidu - Christell</strong></p><h2>Global top 10 </h2><p>Globally, here's what everyone around the world was humming:</p><p><strong>1. Beautiful Things - Benson Boone</strong></p><p><strong>2. Bling-Bang-Bang-Born - Creepy Nuts</strong></p><p><strong>3. Die With A Smile - Lady Gaga</strong></p><p><strong>4. Past Lives - Slushii</strong></p><p><strong>5.

<p>The screen time battle is never-ending, but there's one screen that's much less deserving of time limits. While kids can get glued to the screen watching shows or playing games, one particular screen is the gateway into the imaginative and educational world of books. And thanks to Amazon's sale price, you can gift it this holiday season for less.</p><p>As of Dec. 10, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9lwWV0?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Kindle%20Kids&object_type=article&object_uuid=02P3EMYFDfkyliGzJzJILu5&short_url=9lwWV0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon Kindle Kids</a> is on sale for $109.99 at Amazon, down from the list price of $129.99. That's a savings of $20 and a $15 discount. </p><p>Like the awesome Amazon Kindle, the kids' version brings a glare-free reading experience to younger people. With 16GB of storage, kids will be able to download their favorite books for reading at home during quiet times or to stay entertained while traveling. For parents or grandparents looking to cut down on screen time with kids, rest assured the Amazon Kindle Kids has no apps, videos, or games &mdash; nothing but books on this device.</p><p>Amazon gives each device six months of free access to Amazon Kids+ which means kids have access to thousands of digital books, arranged into age-appropriate categories. These include chapter books and graphic novels, designed for use by kids between the ages of 3 and 12.</p><p>The Kindle Kids screen measures six inches and it's just as bright as the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/kindle-paperwhite-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Kindle Paperwhite</a>, our favorite version of the device for adult readers. Plus, the Kindle Kids can get up to six weeks of battery life before it'll need recharging. The Kindle Kids comes with an included kid-friendly cover including Space Whale, Ocean Explorer, and Unicorn Valley.</p><p>In addition to coming with free access to Amazon Kids+, the Kindle comes with another major benefit &mdash; an awesome warranty. Like many Amazon devices designed for kids, the Kindle Kids comes with the two-year worry-free guarantee. This states that should the Kindle Kids break within the first two years of ownership, Amazon will replace it for free.</p><p>What's more, the Parent Dashboard on the Kindle Kids allows parents to add books from their own accounts into the Kindle Kids' library. Parents can also view reading progress, filter books based on age, and even set a bedtime.</p><p>While many books are educational on their own, the Kindle Kids includes Vocabular Builder and Word Wise to help build reading skills. Those with dyslexia might prefer to read with OpenDyslexic, a font that some readers find easier.</p><p>If you're looking for great tech gifts for kids this holiday season, but want something educational, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9lwWV0?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kindle%20Kids&object_type=article&object_uuid=02P3EMYFDfkyliGzJzJILu5&short_url=9lwWV0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Ftech" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Kindle Kids</a> is perfect.
