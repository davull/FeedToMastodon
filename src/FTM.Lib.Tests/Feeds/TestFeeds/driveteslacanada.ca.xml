<p>Tesla is set to significantly scale its virtual power plant (VPP) operations across Japan, aiming to help stabilize the country’s power grid by deploying Powerwall home battery systems to commercial clients at no upfront cost.</p>



<p>Building on the success of its pilot <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/energy/tesla-miyakojima-virtual-power-plant-in-japan-grows-to-over-300-homes/">VPP project launched in 2021 in Miyakojima</a>, Tesla will expand its energy ecosystem nationwide through a partnership with Fuyo General Lease and Global Engineering, a Fukuoka-based energy company. </p>



<p>The partnership will see Powerwall batteries installed for free at offices and factories under Global Engineering’s electricity service network. Fuyo General Lease will retain ownership of the Powerwall batteries, while businesses that sign up with Global Engineering will benefit from optimized energy use and backup power in emergencies. </p>



<p>The first phase of the national rollout targets the installation of 100 units by the end of 2025, with initial deployments beginning in June, according to <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Energy/Tesla-to-take-Japan-virtual-power-plant-business-nationwide"><em>Nikkei Asia</em></a>.</p>



<p>The Japanese government also appears to be laying the groundwork for broader VPP adoption. A new framework to enable the trading of electricity stored in home and commercial batteries is expected to launch in 2026, which could further accelerate Tesla&#8217;s growth.</p>



<p>With a VPP, Tesla allows Powerwall owners to charge their batteries and discharge them when electricity demand peaks. This dynamic load balancing reduces stress on the grid, enhances energy resilience, and lowers electricity costs for Powerwall owners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Lucid has significantly expanded its operations in Arizona with the official opening of its new Phoenix Hub and manufacturing site in Coolidge. </p>



<p>The expansion is thanks to <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/lucid-acquires-nikolas-arizona-facilities-for-30-million/">Lucid’s April $30 million acquisition of assets from Nikola Corporation</a>, including Nikola’s former headquarters in Phoenix and a manufacturing facility in Coolidge. </p>



<p>According to Lucid, the Phoenix Hub will function primarily as a research and development center, housing equipment such as battery testing chambers, a full-size chassis dynamometer, and machining tools. Meanwhile, the Coolidge facility will serve multiple functions, including warehousing, pre-delivery inspections, and a pilot line for <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/lucid-confirms-2026-launch-for-50k-midsize-electric-suv/">Lucid’s upcoming midsize vehicle platform</a>.</p>



<p>The move adds more than 884,000 square feet to Lucid’s footprint in the state, bringing the company’s total presence to nearly 4 million square feet. As part of the transition, Lucid has also hired 250 former Nikola employees, with more expected to join.</p>



<p>“These new facilities provide Lucid with immediate and substantial capacity for advanced manufacturing activities, as well as developing product innovations and testing components and systems,” said Adrian Price, Lucid’s Senior Vice President of Operations. “This creates a powerful, integrated ecosystem with our existing manufacturing facility in Casa Grande.”</p>



<p>Lucid plans to begin production of its new midsize SUV lineup in Coolidge, targeting a 2026 debut. These new models are expected to start around US$50,000, putting them in direct competition with the Model Y and <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/rivian-reveals-new-r2-engineering-details/">Rivian’s upcoming R2</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a significant move that could accelerate the path to commercial deployment of Tesla&#8217;s Cybercab, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has announced a major update to its Automated Vehicle (AV) Framework. </p>



<p>The update, published on June 13, 2025, introduces sweeping changes to the exemption process under Part 555 of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), aiming to make it more efficient and adaptable for self-driving vehicles.</p>



<p>For years, the lengthy and outdated regulatory process has posed a major hurdle for automakers like Tesla, whose vision of a fully autonomous ride-hailing fleet hinges on government approvals. Until now, applications for exemptions involving Automated Driving Systems (ADS) have often taken years to process—largely due to requirements designed for traditional vehicles and the static oversight structure ill-suited for fast-evolving autonomous technologies.</p>



<p>Under the updated framework, NHTSA Chief Counsel Peter Simshauser says the NHTSA is streamlining this process to allow faster and more flexible evaluations of exemption requests. The agency will now provide enhanced application instructions to clarify what manufacturers need to submit, reducing the need for repeated follow-ups. </p>



<p>Additionally, NHTSA is adopting a dynamic oversight model—replacing rigid, long-term conditions with evolving guidance and more agile monitoring through official correspondence as technology develops.</p>



<p>This new approach is particularly promising for Tesla. The company has been preparing to roll out its autonomous vehicle, dubbed <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-continues-testing-cybercab-at-giga-texas-will-it-launch-early-video/">Cybercab</a>, which would feature no traditional driver controls. For such vehicles to legally operate on public roads, exemptions from certain FMVSS requirements—like steering wheels or pedals—are essential. </p>



<p>The updated AV Framework drastically shortens exemption review timelines, with NHTSA now aiming to deliver decisions within months rather than years.</p>



<p>With the AV Framework now aligned to support innovation while maintaining safety oversight, the green light for Cybercab could come much sooner than anticipated.</p>



<p>While the full impact will depend on how quickly manufacturers adapt to the new instructions and how NHTSA handles oversight in practice, the move signals a broader shift in U.S. transportation policy toward embracing the future of autonomous mobility—not just in testing, but at scale.</p>



<p>You can read the full letter from the NHTSA below.</p>

<p>Tesla has significantly lowered the prices of its remaining pre-refresh Model S and Model X inventory in the U.S., with discounts reaching up to $6,800 for new vehicles and nearly $12,000 on demo models. </p>



<p>The discounts come after the company <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-launches-updated-model-s-and-model-x-in-the-u-s-with-more-features-new-looks-and-higher-prices/">launched refreshed versions of both flagship vehicles</a> featuring updated styling, new features, and performance improvements — but also a price increase.</p>



<p>The updated Model S and Model X, revealed on Thursday night, include new colors like Frost Blue, improved aerodynamics, upgraded suspension systems, quieter cabins, and enhanced active safety systems such as adaptive driving beams and a front bumper camera. With these enhancements now available, Tesla is clearing out older stock at a steep discount to make room for the new lineup.</p>



<h3 id="h-discounts-on-model-x-inventory">Discounts on Model X Inventory</h3>



<p>According to Tesla&#8217;s <a href="https://www.tesla.com/inventory/new/ms?referral=darryn55317&amp;redirect=no&amp;PaymentType=cash">existing inventory website</a>, new Model X inventory vehicles are now listed for below US$80,000. In multiple listings, Model X vehicles originally priced in the mid-to-high $80,000 range have seen price reductions ranging from as little as US$860 to as much as nearly US$7,000 for brand-new units. </p>



<p>The discounts vary depending on configuration, paint color, and seating layout.</p>

<p>Demo vehicles with up to a few thousand miles on the odometer are receiving even deeper cuts. Some demo models are now available for under US$75,000 — a reduction of nearly US$12,000, offering an attractive entry point for buyers looking for a long-range, luxury SUV who don&#8217;t mind missing out on the latest updates.</p>

<p>With attractive pricing and immediate availability, the pre-refresh Model S and Model X inventory may appeal to buyers who value range, performance, and savings over the latest styling tweaks and tech upgrades.</p>



<p>As Tesla transitions to the refreshed lineup, these discounts present a limited-time opportunity for U.S. customers to secure premium EVs at significantly reduced prices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tesla has officially taken the first step to enter the Moroccan market with the formation of a new subsidiary, Tesla Morocco, marking Tesla’s first direct venture into Africa.</p>



<p>Tesla Morocco was established on May 27, 2025, and is jointly registered by Tesla International B.V. and Tesla Motors Netherlands B.V., both of which are Dutch entities that manage Tesla’s global operations.</p>



<p>Executives Rafael Arqueza Martin and Shahin Oliver Khorshidpanah will lead Tesla Morocco’s operations, which will include the import, distribution, and servicing of EVs, as well as the deployment of solar energy and battery storage solutions across the country. </p>



<p>The company is headquartered in the Crystal Tower at Casablanca Marina, one of the country’s premier business districts, according to a report from <a href="https://www.agbi.com/transport/2025/06/tesla-enters-morocco-ahead-of-2030-world-cup/">Arabian Guld Business Insight</a>.</p>

<p>While this is the first time Tesla has established an official entity in Africa, it is not their first foray into the African continent, or Morocco. In 2021 Tesla opened its <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/supercharger/tesla-opens-first-superchargers-africa-morocco/">first African Superchargers in Casablanca and Tangier</a>, with four additional stations opening in the country since then. </p>



<p>Now, Tesla Morocco will oversee a national charging network expansion, alongside plans to promote other parts of Tesla&#8217;s business including solar power, battery storage, and energy management systems.</p>



<p>Morocco is just one of Tesla’s new frontiers. Recently Tesla has <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-opens-first-south-american-store-and-launches-model-3-y-sales-in-chile/">expanded into Chile</a>, marking its first entry into South America. In <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-india-undergoes-leadership-change-as-market-entry-nears/">India, the company is close</a> to officially launching sales operations, although it appears as though the <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-to-focus-on-showrooms-not-manufacturing-in-india-says-union-minister/">company will not venture into manufacturing vehicles in India</a>.</p>

<p>Tesla has officially unveiled updated versions of its premium electric vehicles, the Model S and Model X, for the U.S. market. The latest refresh brings significant upgrades to both vehicles, including new exterior styling, enhanced ride quality, additional tech features, and the introduction of two new paint options. The updates also come with a $5,000 price increase across all trims.</p>



<p>So far there have been no updates to the Canadian configurator and the &#8220;legacy&#8221; Model S/X are still only available north of the border.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-looks-and-colour-options">New Looks and Colour Options</h3>



<p>Both the Model S and Model X now come with updated exteriors styling that includes new front and rear bumpers (Model S only), new aerodynamic wheels, and fresh paint options.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-space-in-model-x">More Space in Model X</h3>



<p>Tesla has also redesigned the Model X interior to offer more space for third-row passengers and cargo, a notable improvement for families or those needing added versatility.</p>



<p>With these updates, Tesla aims to keep the Model S and Model X competitive in the luxury EV space, blending performance, efficiency, and innovation into a more refined package. Deliveries of the refreshed models are expected to begin immediately across the U.S.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pricing">Pricing</h3>



<p>Here are the new base prices for the Model S and Model X in the U.S. Each variant is US$5,000 more than its predecessor.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Model S Long Range</strong>: $84,990</li>



<li><strong>Model S Plaid</strong>: $99,990</li>



<li><strong>Model X Long Range</strong>: $89,990</li>



<li><strong>Model X Plaid</strong>: $104,990</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s Missing?</h3>



<p>Many Tesla fans were hoping for a more substantial update to the Model S and Model X, both of which have seen lagging sales in recent quarters. Among the list of upgrades that some were expecting, but are missing, include improved range and performance, steer-by-wire, 48V/800V architecture, a more substantial design update, Hardware 5 (AI5), and other features that would make the vehicles live up to their luxury reputation.</p>



<p>One item that is missing that almost everyone was expecting is the turn signal stalk. Tesla brought this element back in the new Model Y, saying it returned after customer feedback showed the turn signal buttons on the steering wheel were not ideal.</p>

<p><a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/air-new-zealand-partners-with-spacex-to-trial-starlink-on-domestic-flights/">Air New Zealand</a> has officially begun testing Starlink’s satellite-powered inflight Wi-Fi on its domestic fleet. What sets this trial apart from other is that it includes the world’s first installation on a turboprop aircraft, marking a new chapter for regional aviation connectivity.</p>



<p>Passengers flying on one the airline’s Airbus A320 (ZK OXE) can now access free, high-speed, low-latency internet thanks to SpaceX’s Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Starlink satellite service. Later this month, an ATR 72-600 turboprop aircraft will join the trial, giving regional flyers the same access to seamless onboard internet typically reserved for long-haul routes.</p>



<p>Air New Zealand’s trial marks the first time any airline has taken the technology live onboard a turboprop aircraft.</p>



<p>Air New Zealand’s Chief Digital Officer, Nikhil Ravishankar, says the airline is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible on short-haul routes. </p>



<p>“We’re committed to providing an exceptional experience for all our passengers. This innovative technology could pave the way for more seamless, high-speed connectivity in the skies for Air New Zealand,” he said.</p>



<p>Starlink’s LEO constellation enables lower-latency and more reliable connections than traditional geostationary satellite systems, making it particularly effective in geographically challenging countries like New Zealand. Passengers can browse the web, scroll social media, stream video content, or even play online games—all from the cabin.</p>

<p>The trial’s initial rollout will help Air New Zealand assess how Starlink performs under real-world conditions, such as varying altitudes and short flight durations. Passenger feedback during the free trial period will help guide future decisions on a broader fleet-wide implementation.</p>

<p>Rivian is ramping up development of its upcoming R2 compact electric SUV. Ahead of its planned launch in 2026, the automaker has given us a detailed behind-the-scenes look at its design, powertrain, and electrical architecture. Rivian has shared insights into how it&#8217;s optimizing the R2 for performance, manufacturability, and cost-efficiency, all core elements critical to Rivian’s scaling strategy.</p>



<h3 id="h-designed-for-form-and-function">Designed for Form and Function</h3>



<p>In a recent update posted to its corporate <a href="https://stories.rivian.com/rivian-r2-progress-design-powertrain-electronics-2025">blog</a>, Rivian gave fans a rare peek into the design process for the R2. The design and engineering teams worked closely to create a vehicle that’s not only visually appealing but also efficient to build. As part of cost-cutting efforts, the R2 will launch with limited interior trim combinations—only two dashboard options are confirmed: an all-black variant and a dual-tone grey-and-white scheme. </p>



<p>The latter, showcased on earlier prototypes, is expected to be a paid upgrade, similar to Tesla&#8217;s white interior option for the Model Y.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-maximus-motor-engineered-in-house">New Maximus Motor Engineered In-House</h3>



<p>One of the biggest pieces of information is Rivian’s new Maximus electric motor, engineered specifically for the R2 platform. Developed entirely in-house, the Maximus motor is more compact and less complex than the company’s previous Enduro, also developed in-house, and Ascent drive units. It features a continuous winding process that reduces welding points in the stator, improving both performance and manufacturing efficiency.</p>



<p>In footage from its Powertrain Lab, Rivian demonstrated extensive testing of the Maximus units across extreme temperature conditions. The company also built its own test bank to accelerate the journey from design to production—a move that underlines Rivian’s strategy of vertical integration and reduced dependence on third-party suppliers.</p>

<h3 id="h-advanced-in-house-electrical-architecture">Advanced In-House Electrical Architecture</h3>



<p>Rivian’s Silicon Valley Electrical Lab houses another major innovation: its zonal electrical architecture. First introduced with the second-generation R1 models, this system consolidates multiple controllers into a centralized unit, reducing complexity and cost while enhancing functionality.</p>



<p>This technology stack, which includes modules for infotainment, driver assistance, and autonomy, was developed entirely in-house. As a result, Rivian says it can implement new features faster and deliver regular improvements via over-the-air (OTA) updates—giving the R2 a tech advantage similar to Tesla&#8217;s approach.</p>



<h3 id="h-pre-production-mule-vehicles-undergo-testing">Pre-Production Mule Vehicles Undergo Testing</h3>



<p>The update also showcased Mule 3.2, a pre-production engineering vehicle used to validate electrical systems and wire harnesses. These early-stage test mules are a crucial step before the company moves into design-validation builds, ensuring that hardware and software components work seamlessly together.</p>

<p>Tesla has filed a federal lawsuit against a former employee&#8217;s startup, accusing him of stealing confidential information tied to the company’s humanoid robot program, <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-vp-of-optimus-milan-kovac-departs-after-nearly-a-decade-with-the-company/">Optimus</a>. </p>



<p>The complaint, filed on June 11 in the Northern District of California, alleges that Zhongjie “Jay” Li, a former engineer with Tesla from 2022 to 2024, misappropriated trade secrets before leaving to launch a competing robotics firm, Proception Inc.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rse3WjF_iZ1k/v0">complaint</a>, first reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-12/tesla-sues-ex-optimus-engineer-alleging-theft-of-robotic-trade-secrets">Bloomberg</a>, Tesla says Li was part of the Optimus program’s sensor engineering team and had access to highly sensitive technical data, especially regarding robotic hand design—a component CEO Elon Musk has described as one of the most advanced and valuable in the project. </p>



<p>Tesla claims that in the final weeks of his employment, Li downloaded confidential files related to robotic hand development onto two personal smartphones and accessed internal systems just hours before his departure.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hope ya’ll enjoyed all the new announcements and reveals!<br><br>For folks online, here’s one more new item that is at the event but not presented on the live broadcast <br><br>Next generation Optimus hand! <a href="https://t.co/AAN9fjdSUJ">pic.twitter.com/AAN9fjdSUJ</a></p>&mdash; Perry Jia (@perryzjia) <a href="https://twitter.com/perryzjia/status/1844583812896022622?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>Just six days after leaving Tesla, Li incorporated Proception in Palo Alto, California. Within five months, the startup claimed to have developed humanoid robotic hands that Tesla says bear a &#8220;striking resemblance&#8221; to those built under its Optimus program. The company argues that this timeline would not have been possible without leveraging misappropriated intellectual property.</p>



<p>“Rather than build through legitimate innovation, trial, and technical rigor, Defendants took a shortcut: theft,” Tesla’s attorneys wrote. They further assert that Proception used the stolen data to bypass years of research and billions in investment, gaining an unfair advantage in the competitive humanoid robotics space.</p>



<p>Tesla is seeking compensatory and exemplary damages and has requested a court order barring Li and Proception from using any of its proprietary materials. The lawsuit also cites violations under the Defend Trade Secrets Act and California’s Uniform Trade Secrets Act, along with claims of unjust enrichment and improperly disrupting Tesla’s existing or potential business relationships.</p>



<p>Proception, a Y Combinator-backed company, markets itself as building the world’s most advanced humanoid robotic hands, aiming to revolutionize human-robot interaction. As of now, Li and his company have not responded publicly to the lawsuit, and no legal counsel has appeared on their behalf in court filings.</p>



<p>The case is Tesla Inc. v. Proception Inc. et al., Case No. 5:25-cv-04963, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.</p>



<p>You can read the full complaint below.</p>

<p><a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/rivian-r1t-quad-motor-with-native-nacs-port-leaked-ahead-of-official-launch/">Rivian </a>has issued a new recall for the R1T and R1S in Canada and the U.S. over concerns the front seat belts in some vehicles may not have been properly installed during assembly, posing an obvious safety risk.</p>



<p>According to recall documents posted to the Transport Canada and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) websites, the recall affects 11 vehicles in Canada and a further 536 in the U.S. manufactured between June 6, 2022, and April 10, 2025. According to Rivian, the front driver and or passenger seat belts in these vehicles may not have been properly installed during production. </p>



<p>This could result in the belt loosening or detaching under crash loads, significantly increasing the risk of injury.</p>



<p>The defect was first identified in early January 2025 when a customer reported a loose D-ring. Following an internal investigation and a second warranty case in April, Rivian concluded in late May that a bypass process during assembly may have led to the issue in a limited number of vehicles.</p>



<p>While no accidents, injuries, or fatalities have been reported in connection with the issue, Rivian warns that affected owners might notice a rattling noise near the B-pillar—the area where the seat belt D-ring is anchored—indicating the bolt may not be fully secured.</p>



<p>Rivian will inspect, and if necessary, repair affected vehicles free of charge at Rivian Service Centers. The repair involves properly securing or reinstalling the seat belt anchorage bolt to meet safety standards.</p>



<p>In Canada, affected Rivian owners will be contacted by email to schedule a service visit, while in the U.S., owners of potentially affected vehicles are being advised to contact Rivian Service Support at 1-855-748-4265. The service visit is expected to take about an hour.</p>
