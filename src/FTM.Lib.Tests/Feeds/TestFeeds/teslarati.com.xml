<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared some initial details behind the shocking Cybertruck explosion <a href="https://abc7.com/post/trump-tower-fire-police-investigating-vehicle-explosion-las-vegas-nevada-hotel-driver-dead/15737979/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in front of the Trump Las Vegas hotel</a> on Wednesday. One person was killed and seven were injured in the incident. </p>



<h2>Musk’s initial comments: </h2>



<div class="in-article-ad"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4672671650557568" data-ad-slot="7845413937"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>




<ul><li>Amid reports of the <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-explosion-investigated-potential-terrorism-video/">Cybertruck explosion</a>, Musk posted on X stating that the Tesla senior team is immediately investigating the incident. </li><li>At the time, Musk noted that he would <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1874558969802547611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post an update</a> as soon as Tesla gets data from the ill-fated vehicle. </li><li>“The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now. Will post more information as soon as we learn anything. We’ve never seen anything like this,” Musk wrote in a post on X.</li></ul>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now. <br><br>Will post more information as soon as we learn anything.<br><br>We’ve never seen anything like this. <a href="https://t.co/MpmICGvLXf">https://t.co/MpmICGvLXf</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1874558969802547611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<h2>Tesla’s initial findings:</h2>



<ul><li>In a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1874579547452269054" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">follow-up post</a>, Musk stated that Tesla could now confirm that the Cybertruck explosion was caused by fireworks and/or a bomb that was stored in the all-electric pickup truck’s bed.</li><li>This means that the explosion itself was not caused by any fault in the vehicle or any of its components.</li><li>The ill-fated Cybertruck was a rental unit. Reports have noted that the vehicle was rented through Turo.</li><li>Musk also noted that all vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion.</li><li>“We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself. All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion,” Musk wrote, later adding that Tesla vehicles <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1874580552885604713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transmit their state of health</a> consistently.</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Likely intentional:</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The CEO also reiterated that law enforcement currently believes that the incident was most likely intentional.</li><li>“Appears probable to be an act of terrorism. Both this Cybertruck and the F-150 suicide bomb in New Orleans were rented from Turo. Perhaps they are linked in some way,” Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1874587141491335237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote in a later post</a>.</li><li>As noted in a <a href="https://x.com/america/status/1874585613988688263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">segment on <em>MSNBC</em></a>, three senior US law enforcement officials have reportedly stated that the Cybertruck explosion was being investigated as a potential act of terrorism, and that the incident seemed intentional.</li></ul>

<p>Right before the new year, X CEO Linda Yaccarino teased a number of upcoming features for the social media platform this coming 2025.</p>



<p>These include the long teased and highly anticipated &#8220;X Money&#8221; payment system, as well as X TV.</p>



<div class="in-article-ad"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4672671650557568" data-ad-slot="7845413937"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>




<h2><strong>Platform Expansion:</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<ul><li>In her X post, <a href="https://x.com/lindayaX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linda Yaccarino</a> highlighted that &#8220;users are the media now&#8221; and teased further innovations like X TV and Grok, alongside the new payment feature.</li><li>“In 2024, X changed the world.  Now, YOU are the media! (In) 2025, X will connect you in ways never thought possible. X TV, X Money, Grok and more. Buckle up. Happy New Year!” Yaccarino <a href="https://x.com/lindayaX/status/1874190054660473035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote in a post</a>.</li></ul>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In 2024, X changed the world. Now, YOU are the media!<br><br>2025 X will connect you in ways never thought possible. X TV, X Money, Grok and more.<br><br>Buckle up. Happy New Year!<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f942.png" alt="🥂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>&mdash; Linda Yaccarino (@lindayaX) <a href="https://twitter.com/lindayaX/status/1874190054660473035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<h2><strong>Why It Matters:</strong></h2>



<ul><li>X Payments seems aimed at transforming X into a multifaceted platform, enhancing user interaction and utility by integrating financial services.</li><li>Musk has been pretty open about his idea of <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/x-investors-winning-big-elon-musk-xai-stake-report/">turning X into an “everything app,”</a> similar to WeChat in China.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Subtle Movements:</strong></h2>



<ul><li>An X account for &#8220;Payments&#8221; (<a href="https://x.com/XMoney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@XMoney</a>) was established in January 2024, amassing over 142,000 followers as of writing.</li><li>Interestingly enough, Elon Musk, the platform&#8217;s owner, had been pretty quiet about the potential launch of X’s payment system as of late.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Elon Musk&#8217;s Payment Legacy:</strong></h2>

<p>S&amp;P Global Mobility is estimating a 30% increase in global battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales for 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Provided that the firm’s estimates prove accurate, this could result in 15.1 million battery electric passenger vehicles being sold in 2025. This would account for 16.7% of global light vehicle sales.</p>



<div class="in-article-ad"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4672671650557568" data-ad-slot="7845413937"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>




<h2>Why It Matters:</h2>



<ul><li>Despite challenges in consumer demand and policy support, the growth in EV sales signals a strong push towards electrification, particularly as key markets adjust to new economic and regulatory landscapes.</li><li>For context, in 2024, global BEV sales were estimated at 11.6 million units, a 13.2% market share.</li></ul>



<h2>S&amp;P’s Regional Insights:</h2>



<ul><li><strong>United States</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/2025-auto-sales-forecast-global.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S&amp;P Global Mobility</a> expects the BEVs to see an 11.2% Share in 2025. That’s a YoY change of 36%.</li><li><strong>China</strong> &#8211; S&amp;P Global Mobility expects the BEVs to see an 29.7% Share in 2025. That’s a YoY change of 19.7%.</li><li><strong>Central/Western Europe</strong> &#8211; S&amp;P Global Mobility expects the BEVs to see an 20.4% Share in 2025. That’s a YoY change of 43.4%.</li></ul>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEWS: S&amp;P Global Mobility predicts global EV sales will go up 30% in 2025 compared to 2024.<br><br>&quot;S&amp;P Global Mobility projects global sales for battery electric passenger vehicles to post 15.1 million units for 2025, up by 30% compared to 2024 levels, accounting for an estimated… <a href="https://t.co/ocUMrBrXuU">pic.twitter.com/ocUMrBrXuU</a></p>&mdash; Sawyer Merritt (@SawyerMerritt) <a href="https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1874115334560502123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<h2>Challenges:</h2>



<ul><li>S&amp;P Global Mobility cited some challenges for the <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-sales-61-percent-july-outsells-all-rivals-sp-global-mobility/">global EV sector</a> in 2025. These include uncertainties regarding the “pace of electrification, especially regarding charging infrastructure, grid power, battery supply chains, global sourcing trends, tariff trade barriers, the rate of technological advancements, and the necessary level of support from policymakers to facilitate the shift from fossil fuels to electric alternatives.”</li><li>The political strategies of leaders such as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could also affect the EV sector.</li></ul>



<h2>Key Quotes:</h2>



<ul><li>&#8220;2025 is shaping up to be ultra-challenging for the auto industry, as key regional demand factors limit demand potential and the new US administration adds fresh uncertainty from day one. A key concern is how &#8216;natural&#8217; EV demand fares as governments rethink policy support,&#8221; Colin Couchman, executive director of global light vehicle forecasting for S&amp;P Global Mobility for S&amp;P Global Mobility, stated.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Starlink&#8217;s official X account recently announced that its constellation has grown 10x its size since its first SpaceX launch in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“SpaceX’s first launch of 2024 deployed our first set of Starlink sats with the Direct to Cell capability to help end cellphone dead zones. Today, the Direct to Cell constellation is nearly 10x the size of all other operators pursuing a similar combined capability,” an X post said.</p>



<p>Starlink Direct to Cell received a <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/starlink-direct-to-cell-fcc-commercial-license/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US commercial license</a> from the United States Federal Communication Commission (FCC) in November. However, the Starlink cellular network <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/starlink-florida-hurricane-milton-impact/#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proved its mettle</a> way before receiving its FCC license. </p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Within a few years, <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SpaceX</a> direct to cell capability will improve by more than an order of magnitude, due to increased satellite count and improved technology <a href="https://t.co/FXdc3yjVk5">https://t.co/FXdc3yjVk5</a></p>&mdash; Kekius Maximus (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1874161078508392706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<div class="in-article-ad"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4672671650557568" data-ad-slot="7845413937"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>




<p>Thanks to temporary approval, Starlink Direct to Cell was briefly allowed to offer its services to states hit by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. A SpaceX report stated that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-starlink-direct-to-cellular-mobile-phone/" rel="noreferrer noopener">270,000 mobile phones connected to Starlink</a> Direct to Cell on the first day of service in states impacted by the hurricanes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starlink Direct to Cell currently partners with T-Mobile. SpaceX aims to work with at least one mobile carrier in each country in the future. It also hopes to expand its partnerships with more carriers in the United States.</p>

<p>It appears that Tesla is poised to roll out its Supercharger V4 in China in the near future. This was hinted at in apparent promotional materials from the EV maker that have been shared online.</p>



<h2>Supercharger V4 teaser:</h2>



<div class="in-article-ad"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4672671650557568" data-ad-slot="7845413937"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>




<ul><li>A <a href="https://x.com/Tslachan/status/1874270483560226824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poster</a> shared by industry watchers in social media featured an apparent message from Tesla China stating that “V4 Supercharging Station is coming.”</li><li>The poster also noted that in 2025, “Tesla China’s first batch of V4 Supercharging Station is coming soon.”</li><li>Tesla China’s image seems to suggest that the company would be deploying its V4 stalls with V4 Cabinet in the country.</li></ul>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tesla China has announced that it will soon begin deploying V4 Supercharger stations. <a href="https://t.co/m8MKF2VK5s">pic.twitter.com/m8MKF2VK5s</a></p>&mdash; Yan Chang (@cyfoxcat) <a href="https://twitter.com/cyfoxcat/status/1874269550826709552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<h2>Tesla China Supercharger V4 reports:</h2>



<ul><li>This is not the first time that reports about Tesla China’s V4 Supercharger rollout have been shared online.</li><li>Earlier in December, reports from local media outlets such as <em><a href="https://autonews.gasgoo.com/new_energy/70035361.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gasgoo</a></em> suggested that Tesla is planning on deploying its V4 stations on the Chinese mainland in 2025.</li></ul>



<h2>Tesla V4 Supercharger and V4 Cabinet quick specs:</h2>



<ul><li>Tesla’s V4 Superchargers are the fastest and most powerful EV chargers that have been released by the electric car maker. </li><li>Combined with the <a href="https://x.com/TeslaCharging/status/1857133221538148638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">V4 Cabinet</a>, V4 Superchargers can charge cars at speeds of up to 500 kW and the Tesla Semi at speeds of up to 1.2 MW.</li><li>The V4 Cabinet also supports 400V-1000V vehicle architectures.</li></ul>



<h2>Tesla China’s potential V4 Supercharger ramp:</h2>



<ul><li>Tesla China operates a dedicated Supercharger factory in Shanghai.</li><li>In 2021, the facility was completed, and reports indicated that it had the capacity to produce <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-supercharger-v3-factory-completed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10,000 Supercharger V3 stalls per year</a>.</li><li>If Tesla China is able to produce V4 stalls and V4 Cabinets at its Shanghai Supercharger factory, it could pave the way for a rapid expansion of V4 chargers across the country, and perhaps even the region.</li></ul>

<p>Hyundai Motor Group’s two leading brands, Hyundai Motor Company and Kia Corporation, launched their Integrated Global Information System (IGIS). The IGIS tracks the companies carbon emissions, making it easier for them to comply with global environmental standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hyundai and Kia’s IGIS tracks the carbon emissions throughout a <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/hyundai-enhance-ev-performance-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vehicle&#8217;s entire life cycle</a>, from raw material extraction to manufacturing, transportation, operation, and disposal. </p>

<p>Before the IGIS, the companies used multiple systems, including the Global Energy Monitoring System (GEMS) and Supply Chain Emissions Management System (SCEMS). The multiple systems would track the company&#8217;s carbon emissions across its global operations and supplier network. Recently, IGIS integrated all the systems into one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We developed IGIS with the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2045. Through systematic management, we aim to reduce carbon emissions across all aspects of Hyundai and Kia’s economic activities,” <a target="_blank" href="http://koreabizwire.com/hyundai-kia-launch-new-carbon-tracking-system-to-meet-global-environmental-standards/302178" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Hyundai Motor Group’s Executive VP and Head of ICT Innovation Division, Jin Eun-sook.</p>
