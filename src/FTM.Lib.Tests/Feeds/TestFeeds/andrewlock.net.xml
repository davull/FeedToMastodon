This is a follow on from <a href="/creating-your-first-sample-game-with-monogame/">my previous post</a> in which I took a brief look at the history of XNA and MonoGame and the getting started story. This post continues on where that post left off, starting from the MonoGame sample app to describe the steps I took to port my XNA game to MonoGame.</p> <h2 id="background-porting-a-game-from-xna-to-monogame" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#background-porting-a-game-from-xna-to-monogame" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Background: Porting a game from XNA to MonoGame</a></h2> <p>MonoGame was one of those technologies I had vaguely heard of, but never paid much attention to, and certainly didn't know any of the history or capabilities around it. It came to my attention a couple of weeks ago when James Montemagno and Frank Kruegar were talking about "vibe coding a MonoGame game from scratch" on an episode of <a href="https://www.mergeconflict.fm/457">Merge Conflict</a>. When James mentioned that MonoGame was an implementation of XNA, it really piqued my interest.</p> <p>I was interested because back in 2009, when I was trying to decide whether to work on a PhD or get a job, I dabbled with the idea of getting into game development. I really didn't pursue the gaming side at all, but I worked on a small game as a way of trying it out, and sure enough I used the XNA framework! So I wondered: how easy would it be to port the game I wrote all those years ago to use MonoGame instead?</p> <p>As you'll see in this post, the answer is actually really quite easy. The main issues I ran into were due to the fact that the game I wrote targeted version 3.1 of the XNA framework (and .NET Framework 3.5!😮), whereas MonoGame is based on the 4.0 version of XNA.</p> <p>The game I wrote was a clone of "Trash", which was <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2820">a game I had for the Amiga 600</a> that I spent <em>hours</em> playing with my Dad when I was a kid:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/trash.png" alt="Screenshot of Trash"></p> <p>Trash was itself a shameless clone of Nintendo's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Mario">Dr. Mario</a>, so when I was learning the ropes, it seemed like a good game to clone to get my bearings. The end result was definitely <em>not</em> polished (including crudely built models and sprites using a copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_3ds_Max">3DS Max</a> of…questionable provenance), but it worked:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/trash_02.webp" alt="Screenshot of my Trash clone"></p> <p>So that's the history of my Trash clone. I still had the files knocking around, and after I heard about MonoGame, I decided to give myself an evening to see if I could port the game to MonoGame. Not to actually <em>develop</em> the app or to do anything more with it; just to see if I <em>could</em> update it to MonoGame. I decided my general approach would be:</p> <ol><li>Get a basic MonoGame sample running locally.</li> <li>Replace the content of the MonoGame sample with my Trash source code.</li> <li>Fix any issues that arose.</li></ol> <p>I had no interest in distributing or improving the code. And I have to say, looking back at code I wrote 15 years ago was a horrifying experience 😂</p> <h2 id="creating-the-basic-monogame-sample" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#creating-the-basic-monogame-sample" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Creating the basic MonoGame sample</a></h2> <p>As in my previous post, I started with the "MonoGame Cross-Platform Desktop Application" sample application and used <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-slnx-support-dotnet-cli/">the new slnx format</a> for the solution file.</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># Create the new sln file</span>

</code></pre> <p>As best as I can tell, the fact that my old app targets .NET Framework 3.5 really didn't factor in to the port much; the only issues I had were related to MonoGame using version 4.0 of the XNA API rather than 3.1.</p> <p>For the remainder of this post I'll walk through the steps I took updating the app</p> <h3 id="1-copying-the-files-across" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#1-copying-the-files-across" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">1. Copying the files across</a></h3> <p>The first step was a basic one, I simply copied all the files across from the old project to the new one. That included both <em>.cs</em> files and all the content files like <em>.wav</em> sound files and <em>.png</em> sprite files. The only files I initially left out were:</p> <ul><li>The <em>.csproj</em> file. I used the MonoGame generated file instead.</li> <li>The <em>AssemblyInfo.cs</em> file. The assembly attributes in this file such as <code>[AssemblyTitle]</code> are generated automatically by the default SDK instead.</li></ul> <p>At this point I optimistically tried to build and… not quite.</p> <h3 id="2-fixing-3-1-to-4-0-conversion-issues" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#2-fixing-3-1-to-4-0-conversion-issues" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">2. Fixing 3.1 to 4.0 conversion issues</a></h3> <p>After copying across the old files, I (amazingly) only had a single build error:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">Error CS1061 <span class="token builtin class-name">:</span> <span class="token string">'GraphicsDevice'</span> does not contain a definition <span class="token keyword">for</span> <span class="token string">'RenderState'</span>

</code></pre> <p>A very quick googleing of the error led to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44442303/monogame-whats-the-new-code-for-monogame-for-graphicsdevice">this SO post</a> indicating that this was a breaking change in the move from XNA 3.1 to XNA 4.0: <code>RenderState</code> was removed in favour of <code>RasterizerState</code>, so to fix the build issue, I simply need to replace these calls. For example</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token comment">// Before                                               👇</span>

</code></pre> <p>The fact that this was the only initial build error is a testament to Microsoft's general commitment to compatibility. But even more impressive in my eyes is how seamless MonoGame's support is for the XNA API. I didn't even have to rename any namespaces or anything, the code just compiled. Very neat.</p> <blockquote> <p>MonoGame doesn't actually support <em>all</em> the APIs include in XNA 4.0. Most notably, the <a href="https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4311"><code>.Storage</code></a> and <code>.Net</code> namespaces are not included. The storage and multi-platofrm APIs were deemed too tricky to port to be multiplatform in their original format.</p> </blockquote> <p>So with those changes the game compiled. Time to try running it!</p> <h3 id="3-fixing-the-content-pipeline" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#3-fixing-the-content-pipeline" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">3. Fixing the content pipeline</a></h3> <p>Unfortunately, even though the game compiled, as soon as I ran it, it crashed with a <code>FileNotFound</code> exception:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/monogame_04.png" alt="System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not find file 'D:\repos\TrashMonoGame\artifacts\bin\Trash\debug\Content\Audio\Trash.xgs'."></p> <p>When the app is initializing, it attempts to create an instance of <code>AudioEngine</code>, but the file it's looking for, <code>Content\Audio\Trash.xgs</code> doesn't exist. The <em>.xgs</em> format is a XACT Game Studio file that contains the details of the audio files. This file is normally generated by the XNA content pipeline, but as far as I can tell, MonoGame doesn't use the same process.</p> <p>Rather than try to force MonoGame to use the <code>AudioEngine</code>, <code>WaveBank</code>, and <code>SoundBank</code> types that I was using originally, I decided it would make more sense to switch to <a href="https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_to_know/howto/audio/HowTo_PlayASound.html">the "typical" MonoGame approach</a> to playing sound effects and music.

</code></pre> <p>In the example above, <code>Content</code> is an <a href="https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.ContentManager.html">instance of <code>ContentManager</code></a>, which relies on <a href="https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_to_know/howto/content_pipeline/">the MonoGame content pipeline</a> to load content. This in turn relies on the MonoGame Content Builder (MGCB) tools to process the assets and make them available to the game at runtime.</p> <p>To run the MGCB content editor and to import all your assets, you can run the .NET tool that's <a href="/creating-your-first-sample-game-with-monogame/#exploring-the-default-monogame-template">installed as part of the manifest</a>:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">dotnet mgcb-editor
</code></pre> <p>This runs the graphical content editor that you can use to add content to MonoGame. You can open the <em>.mgcb</em> file that's included in the default template, add your content (<em>.wav</em> files and sprite textures etc), and build the pipeline.</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/monogame_02.png" alt="The MGCB Editor"></p> <p>After adding all of the content, the MGCB editor managed to process <em>most</em> of the content, however there was one file in particular that it <em>couldn't</em> process: a <em>.xap</em> file. This file is an XACT Audio Project, which defines how audio content is handled and processed, but the <code>XactImporter</code> and <code>XactProcessor</code> it requires <a href="https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2661">is not supported in MonoGame yet</a>.</p> <p>Luckily, the <em>.xap</em> file is easily readable in a text editor, for example:</p> <pre class="language-json"><code class="language-json">Cue
<span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    Name = Navigate;

    Variation

    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre> <p>Using this file as a basis, the MGCB editor to process the existing <em>.wav</em> files, and the <code>SoundEffect</code> and <code>SoundEffectInstance</code> types to load the sounds in the game, I replaced the previous sound handling with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16289951/xna-monogame-is-there-an-alternative-to-xact">the updated MonoGame approach</a>. With the sound loading issue fixed, I tried building and running the app again and…nope, still not quite there,</p> <h3 id="4-adding-a-missing-font" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#4-adding-a-missing-font" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">4.

When trying to build I would get the following error:</p> <pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">Narkisim Italic.spritefont: Error  : Processor 'FontDescriptionProcessor' had unexpected failure!.

And sure enough, on my Windows 11 machine, the font isn't installed by default. As it turns out, that's because <code>Narkisim</code> is an optional font, that's installed as part of the Hebrew language pack.</p> <blockquote> <p>No, I'm not exactly sure why I chose to use a Hebrew font😅 I'm guessing it's because it was the closest match I could fine to the original Trash font.</p> </blockquote> <p>I could have chosen to use a different font, but instead I chose to simply <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/windows-missing-fonts?pivots=windows-11">install the missing font</a> using Windows update.

By using that post as a starter, and copying in all my old files, I managed to convert my old codebase in just a few hours.</p> <p>I ran into a few issues during the conversion, mostly stemming from the fact that MonoGame targets the XNA 4.0 API, but most of the issues were fixable relatively easily. The main issue was the lack of <code>XactProcessor</code> support in MonoGame, so I resorted to rewriting the sound processing to use <code>SoundEffect</code> instead. Ultimately this didn't require too many changes, thanks to existing abstractions in my code. Once all the issues were fixed, the game ran great!</p> ]]></content:encoded><category><![CDATA[Game Development]]></category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Creating your first sample game with MonoGame]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this post I provide an introduction to MonoGame, looking at it's history, the requirements for building with MonoGame, and finally a first sample app.]]></description><link>https://andrewlock.net/creating-your-first-sample-game-with-monogame/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://andrewlock.net/creating-your-first-sample-game-with-monogame/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew Lock]]></dc:creator><media:content url="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/mono_banner.webp" medium="image" /><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/mono_banner.webp" /><p>In this post I provide an introduction to the <a href="https://monogame.net/">MonoGame</a> framework. I start by looking at the history of MonoGame and the XNA framework and then show how to get started with MonoGame. Finally we take a look at a default sample app. In my next post I will show how I used MonoGame to port a Microsoft XNA game from 2009 to run on .NET 8 in just a few hours.</p> <h2 id="background-a-brief-history-of-microsoft-xna-and-monogame" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#background-a-brief-history-of-microsoft-xna-and-monogame" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Background: A brief history of Microsoft XNA and MonoGame</a></h2> <p>Microsoft's XNA framework was first announced back in 2004 (and first released in preview in 2006) as a set of tools for building video games that would run on Windows and Xbox 360 (and later, Windows phone). The Microsoft XNA framework was originally based on .NET Framework 2.0 on Windows and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Compact_Framework">.NET Compact Framework</a> on Xbox 360, with this later being updated to support .NET Framework 3.5.</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/Microsoft_XNA_logo.svg" alt="The XNA logo"></p> <p>The XNA framework was meant to provide an easy way of writing games that focused on the content, rather than having to think about all the minutia that would change between platforms. It had a big focus on indie games, where gameplay is the key attraction, rather than the focus being the highest performance or the best graphics. XNA didn't provide a full game engine, instead providing lower-level abstractions, as well as a collection of tools for building content-pipelines and such.</p> <p>Shortly after the XNA framework was released and was heavily promoted by Microsoft, a project called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120620235417/http://www.monoxna.org/node/4">Mono.XNA</a> was created. Much as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_(software)">Mono</a> was intended as an open-source cross-platform version of .NET Framework, so Mono.XNA was conceived as an open-source cross-platform version of Microsoft XNA, enabling users to build games that would run on Windows, Mac, and Linux, using OpenGL for rendering. At around the same time, Bill Reiss started a project called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090317075046/http://silversprite.codeplex.com:80/">SilverSprite</a>, with the goal of running XNA games in the browser, using Silverlight 2.0, and later 3.0.</p> <p>In 2009 <a href="https://github.com/jalf">José Antonio Leal de Farias</a>, <a href="https://monogame.net/presskit/#history">started an open-source project</a> called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140225023450/https://monogame.codeplex.com/releases/view/36738">XNA.Touch</a>, with the goal of porting simple 2D XNA games to mobile. XNA.Touch used code primarily from SilverSprite and some parts from Mono.XNA to create a framework that enabled running XNA games on the iPhone. This culminated in 2010 with multiple games being released to the Apple App Store.</p> <p>In 2011, XNA.Touch was renamed to <a href="https://monogame.net/">MonoGame</a>. MonoGame added support for Android, Mac, Linux, Windows (using OpenGL) in the same year; they added support for DirectX 11, Windows 8, and Windows 8 Phone in 2012; and then in 2013 they added support for the PlayStation 4. Today, MonoGame even supports PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch.</p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/content/images/2025/mono_arch.png"> </picture><figcaption>The architecture of the various MonoGame options, from <a href="https://monogame.net/">MonoGame</a>.</figcaption></figure> <p>Today, MonoGame implements the Microsoft XNA 4.0 API. Just as for XNA, MonoGame provides the <em>building blocks</em> to build your own engine and tools, but it isn't quite an engine itself. It also provides a bunch of tools for working with content (similar to the tools XNA provided).</p> <h2 id="getting-started-with-monogame" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#getting-started-with-monogame" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Getting started with MonoGame</a></h2> <p><a href="https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/index.html">Getting started with MonoGame</a> is incredibly simple if you're already a .NET developer.

</code></pre> <p>MonoGame supports all the IDEs you would expect (Visual Studio, VS Code, and <a href="https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/2_choosing_your_ide_rider.html">Rider</a>). I was just going to use the OpenGL-based application, so as far as I could tell, I didn't need to install any additional components. If you're using one of the other templates, then you may need to install additional components using Visual Studio or the dotnet CLI, <a href="https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/2_choosing_your_ide_visual_studio.html">as described in the documentation</a>.</p> <p>With the templates installed, I set about creating my first MonoGame application.</p> <h2 id="creating-my-first-monogame-application" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#creating-my-first-monogame-application" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Creating my first MonoGame application</a></h2> <p>Before creating the MonoGame project, I created a solution to hold the project. Just to try it out, I decided to use <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-slnx-support-dotnet-cli/">the new slnx format</a> seeing as <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2024/10/04/support-for-slnx-solution-files/">Rider supports it</a>.</p> <p>As far as I can tell, you can't create a slnx file <em>directly</em> using the .NET CLI, so I created a new sln file, and converted it instead:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># Create the new sln file</span>
dotnet new sln
<span class="token comment"># Convert the sln file to a slnx file</span>
dotnet sln migrate
<span class="token comment"># Delete the original sln file</span>
<span class="token function">rm</span> *.sln

</code></pre> <p>Aside from some basic setup, the sample game essentially contains just two behaviours:</p> <ul><li>Listen for the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key on the keyboard, or the <kbd>Back</kbd> button on a keypad, and exit the game if they're pressed.</li> <li>Paint the colour Cornflower Blue as the game background.</li></ul> <p>And that's essentially all there is to it. You can run the template using <code>dotnet run</code>, or by pushing <kbd>F5</kbd> in your IDE. The resulting "game" just shows a blue screen until you hit exit:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/monogame_00.png" alt="The default MonoGame sample 'game'"></p> <p>And that's all there is to it.

Functionally, this results in the same app, but as an app directly modelled in .NET it's (theoretically) easier to both run the stack locally with your IDE <em>and</em> to generate "publish" artifacts for deploying the app. To prove the app is modelled as expected I subsequently <em>publish</em> the app again as a <em>docker-compose.yml</em> file, and compare the output.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note that I have only dabbled with Aspire, not used it in anger, and I haven't got my head around all of the intricacies yet. If you see something weird in this post—I'm not doing something in the best way, or something doesn't work as I <em>think</em> it does—please do leave a comment and correct me!</p> </blockquote> <p>I start by giving a high-level overview of .NET Aspire and why you might want to use it. I then describe the listmonk app, and show the docker-compose setup we're seeking to implement. Piece by piece, we'll convert the standard <em>docker-compose.yml</em> file to an Aspire app host. Finally, we'll add a publisher which allows aspire to generate a <em>docker-compose.yml</em> file <em>from</em> the app host project, and see how it compares to the original.</p> <h2 id="what-is-net-aspire-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#what-is-net-aspire-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">What is .NET Aspire?</a></h2> <p>According to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview">the documentation</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>.NET Aspire provides tools, templates, and packages to help you build observable, production-ready apps. Delivered through NuGet packages, .NET Aspire simplifies common challenges in modern app development.</p> </blockquote> <p>The primary focus of .NET Aspire is the <em>local</em> development experience. It's intended to simplify the interconnections (and associated configuration) that are often required to connect various parts of your system.</p> <p>For example, most apps require a database. When you're working locally, maybe you spin up a PostgreSQL Docker container, or perhaps you rely on a local SQL Server installation. Either way, there are usernames, passwords, ports, connection strings, database names… all things that you need to feed both into the configuration of the database, but <em>also</em> into any apps and services that <em>use</em> the database.</p> <p>Inherently, this configuration isn't <em>hard</em>. After all, we've been doing it for decades. But it <em>is</em> annoying and somewhat error prone. What's more, if someone new starts trying to work on the same project, they have to decode all these requirements for running the app before they can get started. With .NET Aspire the goal is to simplify that process.</p> <p>.NET Aspire has many different parts to it, but at its core, it has an app host project. This is a .NET project which describes and models all the interconnections between your apps. This is where you declare that you need <em>this</em> database with <em>that</em> password, and so on.</p> <p>There's a lot more to .NET Aspire, especially if you're building .NET applications—you can ensure your .NET apps are automatically injected with connection strings, for example—but the app host <em>isn't</em> strictly tied to .NET. The app <em>itself</em> is .NET, but that's just the language for modelling the interconnections between services. It can be used to model <em>any</em> applications, very similar to how a <em>docker-compose.yml</em> file can model any docker-based applications.</p> <h2 id="what-is-listmonk-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#what-is-listmonk-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">What is listmonk?</a></h2> <p><a href="https://listmonk.app/">Listmonk</a> is a self-hosted newsletter and mailing list manager. It doesn't handle sending emails itself, it relies on third-party services for that. Rather, listmonk handles designing email campaigns, managing subscribers, and performing analytics.</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/lismonk.png" alt="The listmonk app"></p> <p>Listmonk is written in Go, using a Vue frontend with Buefy for UI, and is free and open source software licensed under AGPLv3. Being Go, you can run listmonk <a href="https://listmonk.app/docs/installation/#binary">as a single binary</a>, but there's <a href="https://listmonk.app/docs/installation/#docker">also a suggested <em>docker-compose.yml</em></a> for running the application.</p> <p>For this post, I'm not going to be looking into the listmonk app itself at all. All I'm interested in is whether it's possible to create a .NET aspire app host project for running listmonk using the same suggested setup as the docker-compose file.</p> <p>For reference, I'm using <a href="https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/blob/86f808bc77ccded66a42bc19d96ebbd8d5e199ff/docker-compose.yml">the docker-compose file</a> at the time of the v5.0.1 release, reproduced below. This file only contains two services:</p> <ul><li><code>app</code>. The listmonk app itself, running as a docker container.</li> <li><code>db</code>. A PostgreSQL database, again running as a docker container.</li></ul> <p>There's a bunch of shared configuration between the two apps, some volumes and bind mounts, and various other docker-compose specific configuration. For the rest of the app we'll aim to convert this entirely to an Aspire app.</p> <p>For completeness, <a href="https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/blob/86f808bc77ccded66a42bc19d96ebbd8d5e199ff/docker-compose.yml">this is the original <em>docker-compose.yml</em> file</a> we're converting:</p> <pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">x-db-credentials</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token important">&amp;db-credentials</span>                             <span class="token comment"># Use the default POSTGRES_ credentials if they're available or simply default to "listmonk"</span>

I created a new folder, and then created the new project inside it:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">mkdir</span> LismonkAspire
<span class="token builtin class-name">cd</span> LismonkAspire
dotnet new aspire-apphost
</code></pre> <p>This created a .NET 9 Aspire 9.3 app host project. The <em>AppHost.cs</em> project contained the following code; effectively an empty app host project:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token class-name"><span class="token keyword">var</span></span> builder <span class="token operator">=</span> DistributedApplication<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">CreateBuilder</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>args<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

</code></pre> <p>There's a bunch of additional files, but for now, this was what I was interested in, so I set about modelling the listmonk services in this file. I started with the PostgreSQL database, seeing as the listmonk app depends on it.</p> <h2 id="modelling-the-database-in-aspire" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#modelling-the-database-in-aspire" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Modelling the database in Aspire</a></h2> <p>The base Aspire app host project includes the ability to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/app-host-overview#built-in-resource-types">model various resources</a>, such as executables, .NET apps, and docker containers.

</code></pre> <p>The first part of this, the <code>x-db-credentials</code> section, may be unfamiliar to you. It's a way of getting some "code-reuse" in YAML. I'm not going to go into it in detail here. For now, it's enough to know that the <code>db</code> service <em>effectively</em> has the following environment variables defined:</p> <pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">environment</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>

</code></pre> <p>One big advantage of .NET Aspire over YAML is that creating "variables" to share in multiple places is simple and intuitive. Instead of having to create YAML "anchors" and reference them elsewhere, we simply create values and pass them around.</p> <p>What's more, by using <code>AddParameter()</code> we can declare that a value should be provided <em>externally</em>, as it is above for <code>db-user</code> and <code>db-password</code>. What's more, we can mark the fact that these should be secrets, so that if we publish our Aspire app, Aspire can handle the fact they contain sensitive data.</p> <p>There's a few things from the <em>docker-compose.yml</em> that <em>aren't</em> modelled in Aspire, namely the "restart behaviour" and the healthcheck. I left these out, as the <code>AddPostgres()</code> integration adds its own health check, and these are fundamentally specific to docker-compose; we'll look at them again later when we configure a Docker publisher.</p> <h2 id="modelling-the-app-in-aspire" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#modelling-the-app-in-aspire" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Modelling the app in Aspire</a></h2> <p>With the database implemented, we move on to the listmonk app itself. This, again, is implemented as a Docker container, but there's no helpful integration or extension method for it; we'll have to model this one ourselves. Luckily, there's not much to configure; we're mostly just setting a bunch of environment variables, exposing the app over port 9000, and changing the command used to run the app:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token comment">// Optional initial super-user configuration</span>

</code></pre> <p>Most of the variables we set are values that are mirrored in the <code>db</code> configuration. Using variables means we can easily flow the values to both places, which highlights one of the benefits of Aspire.</p> <blockquote> <p>There's a number of things I'm fairly sure I'm not doing "correctly" here. For example, the <code>dbContainerName</code> and <code>dbPort</code>; I hard-coded those as variables when configuring the <code>db</code> service and re-used them here. Is that reasonable? Is that a problem if I (for example) later decide to run my PostgreSQL instance as a service instead of a Docker container? Probably, but that's always something I could address later I guess.</p> <p>Another example is the public port: I hardcoded it to <code>9000</code>, because that's what the docker-compose file does, but I would probably <em>like</em> to just be able to have Aspire choose the host port automatically and then have that flow through. That <em>almost</em> works, but I couldn't see an easy way to have it set the <code>LISTMONK_app__address</code> environment variable to include the host <code>0.0.0.0</code> the way I need it to, without manually creating an <code>EnvironmentCallbackAnnotation</code>. And that just got too ugly.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ignoring the caveats above, theoretically we've now converted the app and can take it for a spin!</p> <h2 id="testing-it-out" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#testing-it-out" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Testing it out</a></h2> <p>Before we can run the app, we first need to set the values for the parameters we defined in our app host. Given that many of these are marked as secrets, we should probably do this using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-9.0&amp;tabs=windows">user-secrets</a> when running locally. You can edit the user-secrets for your app host using the IDE, or alternatively, set the values using the command line. I opted for the latter, setting some "super-secret" values.</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">dotnet user-secrets <span class="token builtin class-name">set</span> <span class="token string">"Parameters:db-user"</span> <span class="token string">"listmonk"</span>

</code></pre> <p>Note that the secrets are all nested under the <code>Parameters</code> key, by prefixing the values with <code>Parameters:</code>. We can now run the app. Either hit F5 in your IDE or type <code>dotnet run</code>, and the app starts up. The Aspire app host starts <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard/overview?tabs=bash">the Aspire dashboard</a>, showing our apps. From there we can view the logs, environment, and various other aspects of our apps:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/listmonk_aspire.png" alt="The Aspire dashboard for our listmonk app"></p> <p>We can also see a link to our listmonk app at http://localhost:9000. Clicking the link opens the app, where we can login with our Admin username and password. And there we have it, our listmonk app, running in Aspire!</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/listmonk_aspire_2.png" alt="The listmonk app running in Aspire"></p> <p>With the app modelled in Aspire, I decided to see what it would like if we went the other way: creating the <em>docker-compose.yml</em> file <em>from</em> the Aspire app host.</p> <h2 id="publishing-the-app-host-as-a-docker-compose-yml-file" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#publishing-the-app-host-as-a-docker-compose-yml-file" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Publishing the app host as a docker-compose.yml file</a></h2> <p>My reason for re-creating the <em>docker-compose.yml</em> file was to see if the <em>generated</em> file looked the same as the <em>source</em> file. If so, then I could be pretty comfortable that Aspire was doing what I intended, at the modelling worked correctly. To do this, I needed to configure an Aspire <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/whats-new/dotnet-aspire-9.3#deployment--publish"><em>publisher</em></a>.</p> <p>A publisher takes your Aspire app host and spits out a bunch of artifacts that can be used by other tools. This could be a <em>docker-compose.yml</em> file, which is what I wanted, but it could also be Kubernetes Helm charts, it could be Azure ARM/Bicep templates, or anything really. This part of the Aspire experience is less mature than the local-dev-loop, but with 9.3 it's looking much more promising.</p> <p>I started by installing the preview package of <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Docker/9.3.0-preview.1.25265.20#readme-body-tab">the <em>Aspire.Hosting.Docker</em> NuGet package</a>. This provides publishing capabilities for the app host:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">dotnet <span class="token function">add</span> package Aspire.Hosting.Docker <span class="token parameter variable">--version</span> <span class="token number">9.3</span>.0-preview.1.25265.20
</code></pre> <p>Next, we enable the publisher by adding the following to our app host:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">builder<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">AddDockerComposeEnvironment</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"docker-compose"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

</code></pre> <p>There's a few cosmetic differences between this generated file and the original, but for the <em>most</em> part they seem functionally equivalent to me! With a bit more work I'm sure I could make them identical, but they're close-enough for me for this experiment. Overall, I'd say it was a success!</p> <h2 id="summary" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#summary" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Summary</a></h2> <p>In this post I described .NET Aspire and the open-source mailing-list manager <a href="https://listmonk.app/">listmonk</a>. Listmonk provides a <em>docker-compose.yml</em> file as a suggested approach to deployment, and I wanted to see how easy it would be to convert the project to run as a .NET Aspire app host instead. The listmonk app runs a PostgreSQL docker container as the database and a separate Docker container as the main app.</p> <p>After the conversion, I used the Aspire CLI and the Docker publisher to export the Aspire app as a <em>docker-compose.yml</em> file, to see how close the conversion was. Overall I think the experiment was a success, though I'm sure there are things I could do better in the Aspire app (let me know in the comments if you have suggestions!)</p> ]]></content:encoded><category><![CDATA[Aspire;Docker;.NET Core]]></category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pushing a whole stack of branches with a single Git command]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this post I show how you can push push a whole stack of branches with a single command using a Git alias: git push-stack]]></description><link>https://andrewlock.net/pushing-a-whole-stack-of-branches-with-a-single-git-command/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://andrewlock.net/pushing-a-whole-stack-of-branches-with-a-single-git-command/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew Lock]]></dc:creator><media:content url="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/push_stack_banner.webp" medium="image" /><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/push_stack_banner.webp" /><p>In this post I show how you can push a whole stack of branches with a single command. This is particularly useful when you're working with stacked branches, and want to push all the branches in the stack at once. In this post I show the git aliases I have created that make doing this a single, simple command.</p> <h2 id="what-are-stacked-branches-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#what-are-stacked-branches-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">What are stacked branches?</a></h2> <p>I'm a big fan of creating small git commits. <em>Especially</em> when you're creating a big feature. I like to create a "story" with my commits, adding bits of a larger feature commit by commit. The idea is to make it as simple as possible for <em>others</em> to review by walking through a commit at a time.</p> <p>As an extension to that, I often create separate PRs for each couple of commits in a feature. This, again, is to make it easier for people to review. GitHub's PR review pages really don't cope well with large PRs, even if you have "incremental" commits. Creating separate branches and PRs for each unit of functionality makes it easier for people to consume and follow the "story" of the commits.</p> <blockquote> <p>To be clear, creating small commits and PRs is often <em>harder</em> than just creating a big PR at the end. Nevertheless, I argue it's worth the effort. Small PRs are easier to review, therefore you're likely to get <em>better</em> reviews than for big commits. Also, it's just polite, as it optimizes the <em>reviewer's</em> time over your own.</p> </blockquote> <p>This approach, where you have lots of separate branches/PRs which build on top of one another, is called <em>stacked branches/PRs</em>. This makes sense when you think of the git graph of the branches: each branch is "stacked" on top of the previous one.</p> <p>For example, in the following repo I have 6 commits as part of a feature, <code>feature-xyz</code>, and have broken those down into 3 logical units, with a branch for each. I can then create a PR for each of those branches:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2022/stacked_branches.png" alt="Stacked branches in a feature"></p> <p>For the first PR, for branch <code>andrew/feature-xyz/part-1</code>, I would create a PR requesting to merge to <code>dev</code> (in this example). For the second PR, for branch <code>andrew/feature-xyz/part-2</code>, I would create a PR requesting to merge to <code>andrew/feature-xyz/part-1</code>, and for the <code>part-3</code> branch the PR would request to merge into <code>part-2</code>:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2022/stacked_branches_02.png" alt="Stacked branches in a feature"></p> <p>Each PR only includes the commits specific to that branch, which makes for a much nicer reviewing experience.</p> <p>I firmly believe working with stacked branches for medium-large features is the best way to work if you're optimizing for reviewability and for remaining unblocked. However, there's no denying working with stacked branches requires more Git finesse than typical single-branch workflows.</p> <h2 id="pushing-a-whole-stack-of-branches-with-a-single-git-command" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#pushing-a-whole-stack-of-branches-with-a-single-git-command" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Pushing a whole stack of branches with a single Git command</a></h2> <p>One of the pain points typically comes up shortly after espousing stacked branches to my teammates. The problem is how to handle the case where you have made changes to multiple branches in a stack and you want to push <em>all</em> the branches in the stack to a remote repository. The sad truth is that I didn't have a good way until recently. My solution was simply doing something like this:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">git</span> push origin --force-with-lease feature/part-1<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token function">git</span> push origin --force-with-lease feature/part-2<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token function">git</span> push origin --force-with-lease feature/part-3<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre> <p>Pretty ugly, but I just lived with it 😅</p> <blockquote> <p>Actually, I had an alias <code>pof</code> configured to make this <em>slightly</em> less ugly using <code>git config --global alias.pof "push origin --force-with-lease"</code>. That way I could type <code>git pof &lt;BRANCH&gt;</code> which at least saves some key strokes.</p> </blockquote> <p>Recently I was working with a particularly big stack of branches, and this finally irritated me enough to actually look into it further. This was also partially inspired <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/blog-comments/discussions/75#discussioncomment-12876326">by a discussion</a> in the comments section of <a href="/working-with-stacked-branches-in-git-is-easier-with-update-refs/">another of my posts</a> about stacked branches.</p> <p>As a toy example, imagine we have the following stack of branches:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/gitstack_08.png" alt="The initial stack of branches"></p> <p>The repository currently has the following features:</p> <ul><li>The default branch is <code>main</code> and it tracks the default branch on the default remote <code>origin</code>.</li> <li>There is a stack of three branches that make up the <code>feature/</code> stack.</li> <li>The <code>feature/*</code> stack has not yet been pushed to the upstream.</li> <li>The <code>feature/part-3</code> branch at the top of the stack is currently checked out.</li></ul> <p>Our goal is to push <code>feature/part-1</code>, <code>feature/part-2</code>, and <code>feature/part-3</code> to the remote repository as simply as possible. We'll start by running <code>git stack</code>, which simply lists <em>which</em> branches are part of the stack and will be pushed:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">git</span> stack
feature/part-3
feature/part-2
feature/part-1
</code></pre> <p>This lists all of the branches to be pushed. This looks correct, so we run <code>git push-stack</code>:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">git</span> push-stack

You have two options:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># Checkout feature/part-2</span>

</code></pre> <p>Which of these options is the most useful depends on what you're doing: if you already have <code>feature/part-2</code> checked out, then the first option is easier, otherwise use the second option.</p> <blockquote> <p>I have used <code>git stack</code> here simply to show what <em>would</em> be pushed. Using <code>git push-stack</code> instead would directly push these branches instead of just printing the branches to push.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another aspect to acknowledge is that <code>git stack</code> "intelligently" determines which branches to push based on the remote default branch, i.e. <code>origin/main</code>. So for example, imagine we now have the following local repository:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/gitstack_10.png" alt="The repository after feature/part-1 was merged"></p> <p>In this scenario</p> <ul><li>The <code>feature/part-1</code> branch was merged to <code>origin/main</code> (likely via a pull request) and the remote branch has been deleted.</li> <li>The local branch <code>feature/part-1</code> has not yet been deleted.</li> <li>The local default branch <code>main</code> has not yet been updated to track <code>origin/main</code>.</li></ul> <p>If we run <code>git stack</code> in this scenario then we get the expected results:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># We don't need to specify the head branch, but specified for clarity</span>

</code></pre> <p>We only push the branches which <em>need</em> to be, and we rely on the <em>remote</em> default branch <code>origin/main</code> for that calculation, rather than the <em>local</em> default <code>main</code>.</p> <p>I'm sure there's more features we could add, but this has been sufficient for me for now. For the rest of the post, I'll describe how you can create the <code>git push-stack</code> command.</p> <h2 id="implementing-git-push-stack" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#implementing-git-push-stack" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Implementing <code>git push-stack</code></a></h2> <p>The <code>git-push stack</code> command consists of four steps:</p> <ul><li>Calculate the default branch (<code>origin/main</code>).</li> <li>Calculate the "merge base" of the stack i.e. the bottom of the stack.</li> <li>Calculate the branches between the merge base and the tip of the stack.</li> <li>Push all the branches calculated in the previous step.</li></ul> <p>To make things easy to test and more composable, I created a Git alias for each of these steps, so we'll walk through them one by one.</p> <h3 id="assumptions" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#assumptions" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Assumptions</a></h3> <p>Before we start, it's worth highlighting a couple of assumptions in these aliases:</p> <ul><li><code>origin</code> is the default remote.</li> <li>You cloned the local repository from a remote, <em>or</em> you have set the default remote branch.</li></ul> <p>These days, the default remote is almost always called <code>origin</code>, but it <em>could</em> be called <code>upstream</code> or anything else.

Tweaking these to assume <code>origin</code> by default but allowing you to change them would not be difficult, but I haven't done it, for simplicity.</p> <blockquote> <p>That's mostly because I dislike having more than one positional-parameter—would it be <code>git stack origin mybranch</code> or <code>git stack mybranch origin</code>🤔—and it's not at all easy to have <em>named</em> parameters in git aliases as far as I know. I'm happy to share updated scripts if this is something you <em>do</em> want.</p> </blockquote> <p>The second point won't <em>normally</em> be a problem. If you cloned a repository from GitHub for example, then you're probably fine. However, if the remote does <em>not</em> set it for some reason, you can set the default branch using:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">git</span> remote set-head origin <span class="token parameter variable">--auto</span>
</code></pre> <p>I discuss this more in the following section, so let's look at the various steps we need to create the <code>git push-stack</code> command.</p> <h3 id="calculating-the-default-branch" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#calculating-the-default-branch" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Calculating the default branch</a></h3> <p>When you create a new Git repository, whether locally or on GitHub, you need to specify the default branch. This was <code>master</code> for a long time, but these days it's typically <code>main</code>. Technically though it could be anything. Rather than make assumptions, I have a command that tries to determine the <em>actual</em> default branch used by the remote repository.</p> <blockquote> <p>This isn't revelatory, a lot of people creating custom Git aliases create a similar alias. I most recently saw this approach in <a href="https://haacked.com/archive/2025/04/17/git-gone/">a post by Phil Haack</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>When you clone a repository, Git automatically checks out the "default" branch (unless you explicitly specify a different branch). Git creates a <code>symbolic-ref</code> in the local repository at <code>refs/remotes/origin/HEAD</code> to point to the default branch of the remote. This ref is updated based on what the remote defines as its <code>HEAD</code>—for GitHub, that’s the branch shown as "default" in the UI.</p> <p>You can read the value of this reference with <code>git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD</code> which prints the remote reference:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">git</span> symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
refs/remotes/origin/main
</code></pre> <p>We only need the final <code>main</code> part of the output, so we create an alias to extract that using <code>sed</code>. I call the alias <code>git default-branch</code>, and define it like this:</p> <pre class="language-ini"><code class="language-ini"><span class="token section"><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token section-name selector">alias</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span></span>
    <span class="token key attr-name">default-branch</span> <span class="token punctuation">=</span> <span class="token value attr-value">"<span class="token inner-value">!git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@'</span>"</span>
</code></pre> <p>If you run this in a repository it should print the remote you expect:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">git</span> default-branch
main
</code></pre> <p>In some cases, you <em>may</em> get an error when you run this:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">fatal: ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD is not a symbolic ref
</code></pre> <p>This indicates that the default branch for <code>origin</code> hasn't been set. This generally won't happen if you cloned the repository from GitHub, but it could happen if you have only setup the repository locally, or for some configurations. To fix it, run:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">git</span> remote set-head origin <span class="token parameter variable">--auto</span>
</code></pre> <p>This queries the remote and updates the local symbolic link to point to the correct branch. Now we know the default remote branch, we can calculate the <code>merge-base</code> for the stack</p> <h3 id="calculating-the-merge-base-for-the-stack" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#calculating-the-merge-base-for-the-stack" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Calculating the <code>merge-base</code> for the stack</a></h3> <p>Per the documentation, the <code>merge-base</code> between two commits is:</p> <blockquote> <p>…the best common ancestor(s) between two commits to use in a three-way merge. One common ancestor is <strong>better</strong> than another common ancestor if the latter is an ancestor of the former. A common ancestor that does not have any better common ancestor is a <strong>best common ancestor</strong>, i.e. a <strong>merge base</strong>.</p> </blockquote> <p>I think <code>merge-base</code> is easiest to visualize, so considering this simple graph:</p> <pre><code>         o---o---o---B---o---o---C
        /
---o---1---o---o---o---o---o---A
</code></pre> <p>The merge base of commits <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> is marked <code>1</code>. Similarly, the merge base of commits <code>A</code> and <code>C</code> is <code>1</code>. The merge base of <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> is is <code>B</code>.</p> <p>When we're calculating our stack, we don't want to require that you've already rebased your stack on top of <code>origin/main</code>, so instead we need to calculate the <code>merge-base</code> between the top-most branch of our stack and the default branch. Luckily Git already has the <code>git merge-base</code> command that does this for us:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">git</span> merge-base <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>commit<span class="token operator"><span class="token file-descriptor important">1</span>&gt;</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>commit<span class="token operator"><span class="token file-descriptor important">2</span>&gt;</span> 
</code></pre> <p>We define an alias called <code>merge-base-origin</code> that runs the above command using the <code>default-branch</code> and <em>either</em> the <code>HEAD</code> (for the currently-checked branch) or a parameter specified by the caller, which prints out the commit. For example, if we had checked out branch <code>C</code> and <code>A</code> was <code>origin/main</code>, then <code>git merge-base-origin</code> would print out the SHA of commit <code>1</code></p> <p>The Git configuration below shows the <code>merge-base-origin</code> command, and how we embed a call to the <code>git default-branch</code> alias in there:</p> <pre class="language-ini"><code class="language-ini"><span class="token section"><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token section-name selector">alias</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span></span>

</code></pre> <p>An interesting part of this command is the bash <code>${1-HEAD}</code>. This says:</p> <ul><li>If there is a user-supplied parameter, place it here.</li> <li>If not, use <code>HEAD</code>.</li></ul> <p>That means we can do things like:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># Use HEAD and origin/main</span>

</code></pre> <p>The next step is the hard one: listing all the branches between the merge-base and our target branch.</p> <h3 id="listing-the-branches" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#listing-the-branches" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Listing the branches</a></h3> <p>The next step, listing all the branches to push, is the tricky part, and I was <em>heavily</em> inspired <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/blog-comments/discussions/75#discussioncomment-12876326">by the discussion</a> on my previous post! The general approach is to use <code>git log</code> to list all the branches between two commits, but it requires quite a bit of playing with the format. I'll build it up bit-by-bit in this section to get to the final command.</p> <p>We start by running <code>git log --pretty=%D</code> and passing in the two commits we want to compare (manually set to <code>HEAD</code> and <code>main</code> at the moment for simplicity). I'm running these commands on the repository we saw previously:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/gitstack_10.png" alt="The repository after feature/part-1 was merged"></p> <p>The <code>%D</code> format ensures that for each commit, we only print out the references pointed to:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">git</span> log <span class="token parameter variable">--pretty</span><span class="token operator">=</span>%D main<span class="token punctuation">..</span>HEAD

origin/feature/part-2, feature/part-2
origin/main, origin/HEAD, feature/part-1

</code></pre> <p>OK, you can see the outline of what we need there. There's a lot of extra noise by way of the <em>remote</em> branches (<code>origin/feature/part-3</code> etc) and the <code>HEAD</code>, plus empty commits, but it's a good start.</p> <p>We'll start by getting rid of the empty lines. We can do that using <code>--simplify-by-decoration</code>:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">git</span> log <span class="token parameter variable">--pretty</span><span class="token operator">=</span>%D --simplify-by-decoration main<span class="token punctuation">..</span>HEAD

origin/feature/part-2, feature/part-2
origin/main, origin/HEAD, feature/part-1
</code></pre> <p>Great. Now we need to get rid of the remote references and the <code>HEAD</code>. We'll use <code>--decorate-refs</code> for that, and specify only the refs we care about, local branches:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token variable">$git</span> log <span class="token parameter variable">--pretty</span><span class="token operator">=</span>%D --simplify-by-decoration --decorate-refs<span class="token operator">=</span>refs/heads main<span class="token punctuation">..</span>HEAD
feature/part-3
feature/part-2
feature/part-1
</code></pre> <p>Perfect! This almost looks perfect, but there's a slight issue that's not obviously apparent. We can see this if we create another branch:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># Just for clarity</span>
<span class="token function">git</span> checkout feature/part-3
<span class="token comment"># Create a new branch on the same commit as feature/part-3</span>
<span class="token comment"># but don't add any commits</span>
<span class="token function">git</span> branch feature/part-4

feature/part-4, feature/part-3
feature/part-2
feature/part-1
</code></pre> <p>This shows the problem: the <code>%D</code> pretty format places the two branches on the same line, separated by a comma. We want each branch to be listed on its own line, so we define our own pretty format instead, using <code>%n</code> as the separator to place each branch on its own line.</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">git</span> log <span class="token parameter variable">--pretty</span><span class="token operator">=</span>format:<span class="token string">"%(decorate:prefix=,suffix=,tag=,separator=%n)"</span> --simplify-by-decoration --decorate-refs<span class="token operator">=</span>refs/heads main<span class="token punctuation">..</span>HEAD

We can simply pipe the output of <code>git stack</code> to <code>xargs</code>, and it will run the command for each of the provided branches:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">git</span> stack <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token function">xargs</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-I</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token function">git</span> push --force-with-lease origin <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>

I hope this makes managing stacks of branches easier for everyone!</p> ]]></content:encoded><category><![CDATA[Git]]></category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Using the new AI template to create a chatbot about a website]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this post I use the new Microsoft's new .NET AI template to ingest the contents of a website and create a chatbot that can answer questions with citations]]></description><link>https://andrewlock.net/using-the-new-ai-template-to-create-a-chatbot-about-a-website/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://andrewlock.net/using-the-new-ai-template-to-create-a-chatbot-about-a-website/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew Lock]]></dc:creator><media:content url="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/githubmodels_banner.png" medium="image" /><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/githubmodels_banner.png" /><p>In this post I use <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-ai-template-preview2/">the new .NET AI Chat Web App template (currently in preview)</a> to create a chat application that ingests the contents of a website (<a href="https://dotnetcore.show/">The Modern .NET Show</a>) and uses that data to answer questions in the chat.</p> <p>This post was partly inspired by a conversation I had with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gaprogman.com">Jamie Taylor</a> at the MVP summit in which he was exploring ways to do exactly this: have a chatbot for discussing the contents of his podcast, <a href="https://dotnetcore.show/">The Modern .NET Show</a>. Seeing as Jamie already has full transcripts for the podcast on his website, this scenario seemed like a perfect use case for the new AI template!</p> <h2 id="the-new-net-ai-chat-web-app-template" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#the-new-net-ai-chat-web-app-template" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">The new .NET AI Chat Web App template</a></h2> <p>In <a href="/exploring-the-new-ai-chat-template/">the previous post</a>, I explored <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-ai-template-preview2/">the new .NET AI Chat Web App template (currently in preview)</a>, walked through the getting started experience, and explored the code it includes.</p> <p>To install the AI template, you can run the following command</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">dotnet new <span class="token function">install</span> Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Templates
</code></pre> <p>You can then create the template by running <code>aichatweb</code>, and providing the required parameters:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">dotnet new aichatweb <span class="token punctuation">\</span>
    -- output ModernDotNetShowChat
    <span class="token parameter variable">--provider</span> githubmodels <span class="token punctuation">\</span>
    --vector-store <span class="token builtin class-name">local</span> <span class="token punctuation">\</span>
    <span class="token parameter variable">--aspire</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span>
</code></pre> <p>I describe these various options in the previous post, as well as how to configure GitHub models to allow free access for prototyping applications using large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI and others. The generated solution looks like the following:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/githubmodels_01.png" alt="The solution layout"></p> <p>Inside the solution folder is a <em>README.md</em> file that describes the remaining configuration, such as how to configure the required connection string for GitHub Models:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token builtin class-name">cd</span> ModernDotNetShowChat.AppHost
dotnet user-secrets <span class="token builtin class-name">set</span> ConnectionStrings:openai <span class="token string">"Endpoint=https://models.inference.ai.azure.com;Key=YOUR-API-KEY"</span>
</code></pre> <p>Finally, I showed the working chat application. You run the app by running the Aspire AppHost project. This starts the web app (and passes in all the required connection strings). The web app then runs an "ingestion" process against 2 pdf files (about watches) that are available in the content folder. More on this later.</p> <p>The web app is a "traditional" chat application, just like you've seen with ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot Chat. This interface lets you ask questions about the PDFs that were ingested. In the example below I asked the question "Which watches are available":</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/githubmodels_02.png" alt="Trying out the default template"></p> <p>The chat assistant interprets your question and decides what phrases to search for in the documents. It then answers your question based on the details it finds in the documents, and even provides a link to the file that contains the answer.</p> <blockquote> <p>This general technique of providing "sources" for the LLM to use, instead of relying on the built-in knowledge is called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and is one way to try to ensure that the LLM provides answers grounded in facts. It involves ingesting source data, encoding it as vectors in a vector store, and making this store available to the LLM.</p> </blockquote> <p>In <a href="/exploring-the-new-ai-chat-template/">the previous post</a> I explore the template in more detail, but in this post I take a different approach and customise the template for a slightly different purpose.</p> <h2 id="modifying-the-website-to-chat-about-a-website" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#modifying-the-website-to-chat-about-a-website" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Modifying the website to chat about a website</a></h2> <p>As I mentioned at the start of this post, when I saw this template, I immediately thought of a conversation I had with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gaprogman.com">Jamie Taylor</a> at the MVP summit in which he was exploring ways to do exactly this: have a chatbot for discussing the contents of his podcast, <a href="https://dotnetcore.show/">The Modern .NET Show</a>. Jamie already has full transcripts for the podcast on his website, so all we should need to do is tweak the data ingestion details.</p> <blockquote> <p>I also had to make various tweaks to the UI to show links to URLs instead of PDFs, but those are less interesting so I don't discuss them here. You can see the updated project <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/ModernDotNetShowChat">on GitHub</a> (the modifications are all <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/ModernDotNetShowChat/commit/a2e9b4fe3b9e2dbef4dceecd62b53bca7393ecbf">in this commit</a>).</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="creating-a-new-ingestion-source" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#creating-a-new-ingestion-source" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Creating a new ingestion source</a></h3> <p>Other than UI changes, the main change needed is to the ingestion code.

</code></pre> <p>This takes a <em>long</em> time (more on that later) but once it's finished, the app starts and we can ask questions about The Modern .NET Show:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/githubmodels_04.png" alt="Trying out the new app"></p> <p>Just as for the original template, the chatbot includes citations for its answers, including links to the page that contained the answer, and a quote from the page.</p> <p>There are obviously a lot of tweaks that you could make to the template and the site in general. For example, I increased the size of the quote that the chatbot can include in it's citations. I didn't play around with the template much more than that, as the proof of concept seemed to work!</p> <h2 id="ingesting-web-pages-is-slow" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#ingesting-web-pages-is-slow" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Ingesting web pages is slow</a></h2> <p>One observation I found is that the ingestion process was <em>very</em> slow. It took an average of about 10 seconds to ingest a <em>single</em> page. And when there's ~250 pages to ingest, that adds up to roughly 40 minutes of ingestion time! 😅 I haven't dug into this too deeply to understand where it's so slow, but I'd be willing to put money on it being the actual embedding step. We generate an embedding for every paragraph in the page, and seeing as that requires a network call, it seems reasonable to think that's the source of the problem.</p> <p>Another aspect that's a little annoying is that the <code>DataIngestor</code> that ships with the template calls <code>CreateRecordsForDocumentAsync()</code> for all of the pages but doesn't <em>save</em> the results until after it's run for <em>every</em> document. That means that if you interrupt the process for some reason (because it's taking 40 mins perhaps 😉) then you have to start from the beginning again the next time you run the app. To work around that I made a small change to the <code>DataIngestor</code> to save after every 20 documents instead.</p> <p>The final issue is that by default, the template uses a random file path for the SQLite ingestion cache every time the app starts up. That means it redoes <em>all</em> that ingestion work every time it starts up. The simple solution to that is to provide a path and filename for the database file. That way the database isn't re-created every time your app starts, and you can instead incrementally update the embeddings:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token class-name"><span class="token keyword">var</span></span> ingestionCache <span class="token operator">=</span> builder<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">AddSqlite</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>
    <span class="token string">"ingestionCache"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>

    <span class="token named-parameter punctuation">databaseFileName</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"modern_dotnetshow_embeddings.db"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre> <p>That simple change makes the app much more usable. Obviously, for production you likely wouldn't be using a SQLite database and JSON file for your vectors, so it wouldn't be a problem anyway.</p> <p>Overall, I think this makes an interesting proof of concept, although how useful it is in practice will remain to be seen I think.</p> <h2 id="summary" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#summary" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Summary</a></h2> <p>In this post I showed how you can use <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-ai-template-preview2/">the new .NET AI Chat Web App template (currently in preview)</a> to create a custom <code>IIngestionSource</code> to ingest data about a website, so that you can chat with an LLM about the site.

In the next post I then customize the app so that instead of ingesting PDFs, it ingests the contents of a website and uses that data to answer questions in the chat.</p> <h2 id="getting-started-with-the-new-net-ai-chat-web-app-template" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#getting-started-with-the-new-net-ai-chat-web-app-template" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Getting started with the new .NET AI Chat Web App template</a></h2> <p>The .NET AI Chat Web App is a new template that shows how to get started building a chat style application backed by a large language model (LLM). Chat apps are one of the most prolific use cases for AI (obviously heavily popularised by ChatGPT), and while they're not always the best way to "add AI" to your app, they can have their uses.</p> <p>To install the AI template, you can run the following command</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">dotnet new <span class="token function">install</span> Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Templates

</code></pre> <p>The template includes various options to control how it works, but there are three main aspects to consider:</p> <ul><li>Do you want the app configured to use Aspire? Yes, of course you do 😉</li> <li>Which LLM provider do you want to use to power the chat interface: <ul><li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github-models"><strong>GitHub Models</strong></a>. This is a great getting-started option, as it's free for developers, and is what I use in this post.</li> <li><strong>OpenAI</strong>. Uses the <a href="https://openai.com/api/">OpenAI API Platform</a>.</li> <li><strong>Azure OpenAI</strong>. Uses the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service">Azure OpenAI Service</a>.</li> <li><strong>Ollama</strong>. Runs locally on your machine, using <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> with the llama3.2 and all-minilm models.</li></ul> </li> <li>Which vector embedding store do you want to use for ingesting the data: <ul><li><strong>Local</strong>. Uses a JSON file on disk, which is great for prototyping.</li> <li><strong>Azure AI Search</strong>. Uses Azure AI Search, which manages the data ingestion automatically.</li> <li><strong>Qdrant</strong>. Runs the <a href="https://qdrant.tech/">Qdrant</a> vector database in a docker container.</li></ul> </li></ul> <p>If you're new to LLMs and AI then that might all be a bit overwhelming, but there's basically two different concepts to understand here:</p> <ul><li>The LLM provider is what provides the AI interface that powers the chat.</li> <li>The Vector embedding is how the LLM model "ingests" data. For each document you provide it, the LLM provides an array of numbers that you store in a database (or in a JSON file in the <code>local</code> case). The LLM can then run queries against the database and find "similar" data.</li></ul> <p>For this post, I chose to use GitHub Models for the LLM provider, as it's free and very easy to get up and running (as I'll show shortly). For the vector store I chose to store the data locally.</p> <blockquote> <p>These are the default values for the template for good reason, as they're pretty much the quickest way to get up and running. You wouldn't choose these options for production, but they're ideal for prototyping.</p> </blockquote> <p>To install the template, you can either use your IDE, or you can use the .NET CLI like so:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">dotnet new aichatweb <span class="token punctuation">\</span>
    -- output ModernDotNetShowChat
    <span class="token parameter variable">--provider</span> githubmodels <span class="token punctuation">\</span>
    --vector-store <span class="token builtin class-name">local</span> <span class="token punctuation">\</span>
    <span class="token parameter variable">--aspire</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span>
</code></pre> <p>This creates a full solution consisting of:</p> <ul><li>A Web project containing the chat app</li> <li>A "Service Defaults" project—A suggested best practice for creating Aspire applications these days</li> <li>An "App Host" project—The Aspire host project, that wires up the dependencies</li></ul> <p>There's also a <em>.sln</em> file you can open in your IDE:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/githubmodels_01.png" alt="The solution layout"></p> <p>Inside the solution folder is a <em>README.md</em> file that describes the remaining configuration. For our setup, there's just one step we need to take: configuring GitHub Models.</p> <h2 id="using-github-models" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#using-github-models" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Using GitHub Models</a></h2> <p>The <em>README.md</em> file contains instructions for getting started with GitHub Models:</p> <blockquote> <p>To use models hosted by GitHub Models, you will need to create a GitHub personal access token. The token should not have any scopes or permissions. See <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens">Managing your personal access tokens</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/prototyping-with-ai-models">GitHub Models</a> is a service from GitHub that provides developers an easy way to prototype with LLMs and Generative AI. All that you need is a GitHub account, and you can be running against all the latest models from OpenAI and others <em>without</em> having to sign up to those services directly.</p> <blockquote> <p>GitHub Models is strictly for "prototyping" so it comes with some hefty usage limits and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-content-safety">content filters</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>To get started with GitHub models you just need to choose a model and retrieve a token:</p> <ol><li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/models">github.com/marketplace/models</a>.</li> <li>Click <strong>Model: Select a Model</strong> at the top left of the page.</li> <li>Choose a model from the dropdown menu.</li></ol> <p>After selecting a model, you'll see the screen below. As you can see, you can get SDK details and see various other configuration options:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/githubmodels.png" alt="The getting started page from GitHub models"></p> <p>We don't need any to worry about any of that SDK information, as that's already handled by the .NET NuGet packages and the template. All you need is a personal access token (PAT):</p> <ul><li>Click <strong>Get developer key</strong> on the above screen</li> <li>This redirects to GitHub's token management page: <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">https://github.com/settings/tokens</a></li> <li>Click <strong>Generate new token</strong>, and generate a fine grained token (not classic)</li> <li>Enter a name for the token, and an expiry ~~but do not add any permissions or roles.~~ Note that <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-15-modelsread-now-required-for-github-models-access/">as of May 15 2025</a>, your fine-grained GitHub Models tokens must now have the <code>model:read</code> permission.</li></ul> <p>After creating the token, you can add it as a secret to your application. You need to add the token as a connection string inside the Aspire AppHost project. You can do that using the IDE editor integration in Visual Studio or Rider, or you can use the command line. For example, for my app, I ran the following (replacing <code>YOUR-API-KEY</code> with the token value):</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token builtin class-name">cd</span> ModernDotNetShowChat.AppHost
dotnet user-secrets <span class="token builtin class-name">set</span> ConnectionStrings:openai <span class="token string">"Endpoint=https://models.inference.ai.azure.com;Key=YOUR-API-KEY"</span>
</code></pre> <p>As you can probably tell from the above setting, GitHub Models runs using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service">Azure OpenAI Service</a>, hence the reference to Azure in the connection string. If you choose a different LLM provider then these settings will be different.</p> <p>With the secret added, everything is ready to take the template for a spin.</p> <h2 id="briefly-trying-out-the-template" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#briefly-trying-out-the-template" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Briefly trying out the template</a></h2> <p>Before we dig in further, we'll take the standard template for a spin.</p> <blockquote> <p>You can read more about getting started in <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-ai-template-preview2/">the Preview 2 announcement post</a> for the template.</p> </blockquote> <p>You run the app by running the Aspire AppHost project. This starts the web app (and passes in all the required connection strings). The web app then runs an "ingestion" process against 2 pdf files (about watches) that are available in the content folder. More on this later.</p> <p>The web app is a "traditional" chat application, just like you've seen with ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot Chat. This interface lets you ask questions about the PDFs that were ingested. In the example below I asked the question "Which watches are available":</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/githubmodels_02.png" alt="Trying out the default template"></p> <p>The chat assistant interprets your question and decides what phrases to search for in the documents. It then answers your question based on the details it finds in the documents, and even provides a link to the file that contains the answer.</p> <blockquote> <p>This general technique of providing "sources" for the LLM to use, instead of relying on the built-in knowledge is called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and is one way to try to ensure that the LLM provides answers grounded in facts. It involves ingesting source data, encoding it as vectors in a vector store, and making this store available to the LLM.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's pretty much all there is to the app, but it provides a powerful template that you can extend and modify to work for your own application. For the remainder of the post I look at a couple of points of interest about the template.</p> <h2 id="the-aspire-app-host" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#the-aspire-app-host" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">The Aspire App Host</a></h2> <p>We'll start by looking at the Aspire App Host.

This is the core infrastructure for interacting with the OpenAI service using the OpenAI NuGet package and Microsoft.Extensions.AI abstractions. This also registers an embedding generator for OpenAI for converting the ingested documents into vectors that can later be serialised.</li> <li>The vector store is responsible for persisting the generated embeddings, and for providing the mechanism for OpenAI to search the store as required.</li> <li>The ingestion cache is an EF Core <code>DbContext</code> that keeps track of which documents have been ingested into the vector store. This allows the app to avoid ingesting the same documents multiple times as well as to remove documents that are no longer available.</li></ul> <p>The configuration of these services all happens in the <em>Program.cs</em> file of the web app, as shown below.

    You are an assistant who answers questions about information you retrieve.
    Do not answer questions about anything else.
    Use only simple markdown to format your responses.

    Use the search tool to find relevant information. When you do this, end your
    reply with citations in the special XML format:

    &lt;citation filename='string' page_number='number'&gt;exact quote here&lt;/citation&gt;

    Always include the citation in your response if there are results.

    The quote must be max 5 words, taken word-for-word from the search result, and is the basis for why the citation is relevant.
    Don't refer to the presence of citations; just emit these tags right at the end, with no surrounding text.

In the previous post I provided an overview of the built-in Dependency Injection lifetimes, and described the additional proposed lifetimes: tenant, pooled, and drifter.</p> <p>The previous post provided a overview of each of these proposed lifetimes, and an implementation of the drifter (time-based) lifetime. In this post I provide an example of the "pooled" lifetime.</p> <h2 id="dependency-injection-lifetimes" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#dependency-injection-lifetimes" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Dependency injection lifetimes</a></h2> <p>This post is intended as a direct follow-on from the <a href="/going-beyond-singleton-scoped-and-transient-lifetimes/">previous post</a> in which I provide the full context, but I'll provide a brief outline of the premise here. When you register services in the .NET Core DI container, you choose one of three different lifetimes.</p> <ul><li>Singleton</li> <li>Scoped</li> <li>Transient</li></ul> <p>The lifetime you specify controls how and when the DI container chooses to create a new instance of a given service, and when it instead returns an already-existing instance of the service:</p> <ul><li>Singleton—only a single instance is ever created</li> <li>Scoped—a new instance is created once per "scope" (typically per request)</li> <li>Transient—a new instance is created every time it's needed</li></ul> <blockquote> <p>For a full introduction to dependency injection in .NET Core, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection">the Microsoft documentation</a>, or <a href="https://livebook.manning.com/book/asp-net-core-in-action-third-edition/chapter-8/">chapters 8</a> <a href="https://livebook.manning.com/book/asp-net-core-in-action-third-edition/chapter-9/">and 9</a> of my book.</p> </blockquote> <p>In <a href="https://www.breakpoint.show/podcast/episode-036-episode-of-a-lifetime/">episode 36 of The Breakpoint Show</a>, Khalid, Maarten, and Woody discuss the three lifetimes I described above, providing some examples of when you might choose each one, problems to watch out for, and other things to consider.</p> <p>Throughout the show, they also discuss the desire for three "additional" types of services, which didn't quite fit into the standard lifetimes:</p> <ul><li>Tenant-scoped services—effectively per-tenant singletons</li> <li>Time-based (drifter) services—singleton services that are replaced periodically</li> <li>Pooled services—reuses a "pool" of services</li></ul> <p>You can read one way to implement tenant-scoped services <a href="https://michael-mckenna.com/multi-tenant-asp-dot-net-8-tenant-resolution/">in this blog series</a> from Michael McKenna and I showed an implementation of the time-based/drifter lifetime <a href="/going-beyond-singleton-scoped-and-transient-lifetimes/#implementing-a-simple-time-based-lifetime-service">in my previous post</a>. In this post I look at one possible implementation of a pooled lifetime.</p> <h2 id="pooled-lifetime-requirements" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#pooled-lifetime-requirements" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Pooled lifetime requirements</a></h2> <p>Woody mentioned pooling in <a href="https://www.breakpoint.show/podcast/episode-036-episode-of-a-lifetime/">the podcast episode</a> as a way to reduce allocations and thereby improve performance. The pooled lifetime (inspired by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics?tabs=with-di%2Cexpression-api-with-constant#dbcontext-pooling">EF Core's <code>DbContext</code> pooling feature</a>) would make this capability a general DI feature, allowing pooling of "arbitrary" services.</p> <p>In general, I considered the requirements for this feature to be:</p> <ul><li>Pooled services should have "scoped" semantics, i.e. when a pooled instance is used, it should be used for the whole request scope, and should not be used by parallel requests.</li> <li>When a pooled service is requested, the DI should use a pooled instance first, if available. If no pooled instances are available, the DI container should create a new instance.</li> <li>When the scope is disposed, pooled services should be returned to the pool.</li> <li>The DI container should pool a maximum of <code>N</code> instances of the service. When an instance is returned, if there are already <code>N</code> instances in the pool, the returned instance should be discarded (calling <code>Dispose()</code> if required).</li> <li>Pooled services must implement the <code>IResettableService</code> interface, which contains a single <code>Reset</code> method.</li> <li>When an instance is returned to the pool, the pool should call <code>Reset()</code> on the instance. This must reset the instance, so that it's safe to reuse in another request.</li> <li>Other than <code>IResettableService</code>, there should be no other "additional" requirements on the pooled service.</li> <li>If a service implements <code>IDisposable</code>, it must be disposed if it is not returned to the pool.</li></ul> <p>I considered those to be the main requirements, but to make my proof of concept implementation a bit easier, I added a few anti-requirements:</p> <ul><li>It's permissible to return a "wrapper" type to access the pooled service (similar to how the <code>IOptions&lt;&gt;</code> abstraction works in ASP.NET Core).</li> <li>Ignore <code>async</code> requirements for now i.e. no need for a <code>ResetAsync()</code> or supporting <code>IAsyncDisposable</code>.</li> <li>Don't worry about configuration of the pool i.e. allow a "fixed" maximum size for the pool.</li></ul> <p>That covers the majority of the important behaviour points. In the next section, I'll show an example implementation that meets all of these.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note that I chose <em>not</em> to use <code>ObjectPool&lt;T&gt;</code> to explore this. Not for any principled reason, I was just hoping to have a slightly different API. You can see a similar implementation that uses <code>ObjectPool&lt;T&gt;</code> in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/objectpool?view=aspnetcore-9.0">the Microsoft docs</a>.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="implementing-a-pooled-lifetime-service" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#implementing-a-pooled-lifetime-service" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Implementing a pooled lifetime service</a></h2> <p>There are 5 different moving parts in the implementation:</p> <ul><li><code>IResettableService</code>—The interface that resettable services must implement</li> <li><code>IPooledService&lt;T&gt;</code>—The interface used to access an instance of item <code>T</code> (analogous to <code>IOptions&lt;T&gt;</code>)</li> <li><code>PooledService&lt;T&gt;</code>—The internal implementation of <code>IPooledService&lt;T&gt;</code></li> <li><code>DependencyPool&lt;T&gt;</code>—The pooling implementation, responsible for the rent and return of <code>IPooledService&lt;T&gt;</code></li> <li><code>PoolingExtensions</code>—Helper methods for adding the required services to the DI container.</li></ul> <p>Now let's look at each of these in turn</p> <h3 id="iresettableservice" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#iresettableservice" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline"><code>IResettableService</code></a></h3> <p>This is the only requirement on the pooled service itself, and there's only one method to implement, <code>Reset()</code>:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">interface</span> <span class="token class-name">IResettableService</span>

</code></pre> <p>When called, <code>Reset()</code> should reset the service to its "original" state, so that it can be reused when it's removed from the pool. If we compare this to <code>DbContext</code> (the original inspiration for the pooling idea), this is where the change tracking would be reset, for example.</p> <h3 id="ipooledservicet" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#ipooledservicet" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline"><code>IPooledService&lt;T&gt;</code></a></h3> <p>The <code>IPooledService&lt;T&gt;</code> interface is how the application primarily retrieves instances of a pooled service <code>T</code>. It's the type that you inject into your service constructors, and it's how you access instances of <code>T</code>, similar to how <code>IOptions&lt;T&gt;</code> works for configuration:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">interface</span> <span class="token class-name">IPooledService<span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">out</span> T<span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre> <p>As you can see from the above, the service <code>T</code> must implement <code>IResettableService</code> and can be accessed via the <code>Value</code> property. For example, you might use it in a dependent service like this:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">DependentService</span>

</code></pre> <p>This level of indirection is a bit annoying from a practical point of view, but I found it to be a necessary evil to create a <em>generalised</em> pooling lifetime.

</code></pre> <p>As you can see from the code above, the <code>PooledService&lt;T&gt;</code> implementation depends on the <code>DependencyPool&lt;T&gt;</code>, which we'll look into in detail shortly. The service rents an instance of <code>T</code> from the pool in the constructor. The DI container will then automatically dispose the <code>PooledService&lt;T&gt;</code> when the service scope ends, which returns the service <code>T</code> to the pool.</p> <h3 id="dependencypoolt" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#dependencypoolt" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline"><code>DependencyPool&lt;T&gt;</code></a></h3> <p>The <code>DependencyPool&lt;T&gt;</code> instance is where the bulk of the work happens for the implementation.

</code></pre> <p>Note that we <em>don't</em> register <code>T</code> itself as a service that you can directly pull from the container; you always need to retrieve an <code>IPooledService&lt;T&gt;</code> and access the <code>T</code> by calling <code>Value</code>. You <em>might</em> think that you could handle this automatically in the container, doing something like the following:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">services<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">AddScoped</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>s <span class="token operator">=&gt;</span> s<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token generic-method"><span class="token function">GetRequiredService</span><span class="token generic class-name"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>IPooledService<span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>T<span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>Value<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

By having the DI container return the <code>T</code> directly, the DI container will automatically dispose the <code>T</code> when the scope ends.

</code></pre> <p>By looking at the Ids printed, we can see this works as expected:</p> <ul><li>5 new instances are created to satisfy the 5 parallel scopes.</li> <li>When the scopes are disposed, the maximum 3 instances are reset and stored in the pool. The remaining two services are disposed as they can't be pooled.</li> <li>When the sequence is run again, the first 3 requests use pooled instances. The remaining two instances must be created, giving Ids <code>6</code> and <code>7</code>.</li> <li>When the scopes are disposed, again the 3 instances are pooled, and the remaining 2 are disposed.</li></ul> <p>So it seems the implementation is working as expected, but I think it's worth thinking about the limitations and considering whether you <em>should</em> use something like this.</p> <h2 id="limitations-in-the-pooled-lifetime-implementation" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#limitations-in-the-pooled-lifetime-implementation" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Limitations in the pooled lifetime implementation</a></h2> <p>The inspiration for the pooling lifetime was EF Core's pooling of <code>DbContext</code>, but the above implementation is fundamentally a bit different. The <code>DbContext</code> was designed to "know" about pooling, and its internal implementation has knowledge of <code>DbContextLease</code> which tracks the origin of <code>DbContext</code> instances etc. That stands in contrast to the above implementation in which the implementation class doesn't need to know about the pooling details (other than providing a <code>Reset()</code> implementation).</p> <p>The net result of the <code>DbContext</code> implementation is that the <em>usage</em> of <code>DbContext</code> is identical, whether or not you use pooling. That again contrasts with the implementation in this post, in which you must use the <code>IPooledService&lt;T&gt;</code> intermediate abstraction.</p> <p>Another thing to consider in the above implementation is that your pooled services <em>can't</em> depend on scoped services, even though the services behave somewhat like scoped services themselves. That's because the instances "live" longer than a single service scope, so the only lifetime that really makes sense for dependencies is singleton, or possibly transient.</p> <p>Yet another aspect to consider is that the pool is very simplistic. It's first-come first-served in both renting and return. Once the items are in the pool, they're there to stay until they rented again. You <em>could</em> improve all that of course, but as you make things more complicated, you risk removing the benefits that pooling could bring.</p> <h2 id="is-pooling-actually-useful-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#is-pooling-actually-useful-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Is pooling actually useful?</a></h2> <p>The original inspiration for the pooling lifetime was EF Core's <code>DbContext</code> pooling, for which a <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/tree/main/samples/core/Benchmarks/ContextPooling.cs">single-threaded benchmark</a> shows that pooling can improve performance and reduce allocation:</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th style="text-align:right">NumBlogs</th><th style="text-align:right">Mean</th><th style="text-align:right">Error</th><th style="text-align:right">StdDev</th><th style="text-align:right">Gen 0</th><th style="text-align:right">Gen 1</th><th style="text-align:right">Gen 2</th><th style="text-align:right">Allocated</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>WithoutContextPooling</td><td style="text-align:right">1</td><td style="text-align:right">701.6 us</td><td style="text-align:right">26.62 us</td><td style="text-align:right">78.48 us</td><td style="text-align:right">11.7188</td><td style="text-align:right">-</td><td style="text-align:right">-</td><td style="text-align:right">50.38 KB</td></tr><tr><td>WithContextPooling</td><td style="text-align:right">1</td><td style="text-align:right">350.1 us</td><td style="text-align:right">6.80 us</td><td style="text-align:right">14.64 us</td><td style="text-align:right">0.9766</td><td style="text-align:right">-</td><td style="text-align:right">-</td><td style="text-align:right">4.63 KB</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>However, just because it is beneficial overall for EF Core, doesn't <em>necessarily</em> mean it will always be beneficial. This is explicitly called out by Microsoft in <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/async-valuetask-pooling-in-net-5/">a blog post discussing pooling of <code>ValueTask</code> instances</a>, back in .NET 5</p> <blockquote> <p>In employing such a pool, the developer is betting that they can implement a custom allocator (which is really what a pool is) that’s better than the general-purpose GC allocator. Beating the GC is not trivial. But, a developer might be able to, given knowledge they have of their specific scenario.</p> </blockquote> <p>Memory allocation in .NET is very efficient; the runtime is <em>fast</em> at allocating memory and is even quick at cleaning up small objects. So although pooling means the allocator generally doesn't need to run as much, that's not really where you're getting performance improvements.</p> <p>One possible source of performance improvements from pooling can come when the objects being allocated are large. Large objects are generally more expensive for the GC, because the more memory allocated, the more often the GC has to run, and the more work it has to do (to zero out the memory etc).</p> <p>Pooling can also provide an advantage if constructing the objects is expensive. This could be because the constructor itself does a bunch of work. It could also be because the DI container doesn't need to calculate and reconstruct the full dependency graph for the object every time it's requested. Or it could be because you need to use a limited OS resource.</p> <p>However, there are interesting problems to think about here, which <em>could</em> undermine any garbage collection improvements you might expect to see from pooling.</p> <p>First of all, if the <code>Reset()</code> method has to do more work than the GC would in collecting it, then you've immediately lost any advantage you could expect to get from pooling. But there's an even more subtle issue.</p> <p>The .NET GC is a generational garbage collector. Newly allocated objects are placed in Gen 0, and can typically be quickly cleaned up. If a given object survives a garbage collection because it is still in use, it is promoted to Gen 1. The longest living objects are eventually promoted to Gen 2.</p> <p>In general, the higher the GC generation, the more expensive it is to clean up. Ideally the GC tries to scan all the Gen 0 objects to see if they're still alive. This works well because generally Gen 0 objects reference <em>other</em> Gen 0 objects. Where things get tricky is if a Gen <strong>2</strong> object has a reference to a Gen 0 object. Then suddenly the GC needs to check the Gen 2 objects to find out if that Gen 0 object can be collected. And that's a <em>lot</em> more expensive.</p> <p>And what does pooling do? It makes objects live longer, so they end up in Gen 2. If those objects hold references to short-lived objects…then suddenly you've made GCs <em>much</em> more expensive.😬</p> <blockquote> <p>These issues (and others) are discussed by Stephen Toub with Scott Hanselman in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/on-dotnet/lets-build-our-own-arraypool-deep-dotnet-with-stephen-scott#time=39m51s">the Deep .NET video on ArrayPool</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>So in conclusion: should you use this?

</code></pre> <p>Every time you request a <code>TransientService</code> instance, even if you're in the same request, the DI container creates a new instance of the <code>TransientService</code> class.</p> <p>That covers the standard scopes supported by the <em>Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection</em> libraries used by ASP.NET Core . In the next section I describe some of the "hypothetical" scopes that were discussed on <a href="https://www.breakpoint.show/podcast/episode-036-episode-of-a-lifetime/">The Breakpoint Show</a>.</p> <h2 id="the-breakpoint-show-s-additional-lifetime-scopes" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#the-breakpoint-show-s-additional-lifetime-scopes" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">The Breakpoint Show's additional lifetime scopes</a></h2> <p>In <a href="https://www.breakpoint.show/podcast/episode-036-episode-of-a-lifetime/">episode 36 of The Breakpoint Show</a>, Khalid, Maarten, and Woody discuss the three lifetimes I described above, providing some examples of when you might choose each one, problems to watch out for, and other things to consider.</p> <p>Throughout the show, they also discussed the desire for three "additional" types of services, which didn't quite fit into the standard lifetimes:</p> <ul><li>Tenant-scoped services</li> <li>Pooled services</li> <li>Time-based (drifter) services</li></ul> <p>In the following sections I provide a brief high-level overview of these theoretical scopes.</p> <h3 id="tenant-scoped-services" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#tenant-scoped-services" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Tenant-scoped services</a></h3> <p>Tenant-scoped services were mentioned by Maarten as a practical existing example, which he has used in real multi-tenant applications. They are useful when you want some services to be "singletons", but you <em>don't</em> want them to be shared between the <em>whole</em> application. Rather, you want them to be "singletons for a given tenant".</p> <p>As you might expect, multi-tenant applications are relatively common, so there are various packages you can use to help configure singleton services in your application. I wrote about SaasKit <a href="https://andrewlock.net/tag/multi-tenancy/">back in 2016</a>, but that package hasn't seen many updates since then, and there are some <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=multitenant">modern alternatives</a> now.</p> <p>One of these alternatives is explained by Michael McKenna <a href="https://michael-mckenna.com/multi-tenant-asp-dot-net-8-tenant-resolution/">in his blog series</a>. In particular <a href="https://michael-mckenna.com/multi-tenant-asp-dot-net-8-tenant-services/">he describes how you can create "tenant-scoped" services</a> by creating a new "tenant-scoped root" container when a request arrives in an ASP.NET Core application, which ensures each tenant's services are isolated from one another. I won't describe the approach further here, as Michael does a great job of explaining how it works on his blog.</p> <h3 id="pooled-services" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#pooled-services" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Pooled services</a></h3> <p>Pooled services were mentioned by Woody as a way to reduce allocations in your application in order to improve performance. It was inspired by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics?tabs=with-di%2Cexpression-api-with-constant#dbcontext-pooling">EF Core's <code>DbContext</code> pooling feature</a> which can be useful in some high-performance scenarios. The <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/tree/main/samples/core/Benchmarks/ContextPooling.cs">single-threaded benchmark</a> performance comparing <code>DbContext</code> pooling with no-pooling shows that it can make a significant difference in some cases:</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th style="text-align:right">NumBlogs</th><th style="text-align:right">Mean</th><th style="text-align:right">Error</th><th style="text-align:right">StdDev</th><th style="text-align:right">Gen 0</th><th style="text-align:right">Gen 1</th><th style="text-align:right">Gen 2</th><th style="text-align:right">Allocated</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>WithoutContextPooling</td><td style="text-align:right">1</td><td style="text-align:right">701.6 us</td><td style="text-align:right">26.62 us</td><td style="text-align:right">78.48 us</td><td style="text-align:right">11.7188</td><td style="text-align:right">-</td><td style="text-align:right">-</td><td style="text-align:right">50.38 KB</td></tr><tr><td>WithContextPooling</td><td style="text-align:right">1</td><td style="text-align:right">350.1 us</td><td style="text-align:right">6.80 us</td><td style="text-align:right">14.64 us</td><td style="text-align:right">0.9766</td><td style="text-align:right">-</td><td style="text-align:right">-</td><td style="text-align:right">4.63 KB</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>These numbers look great, and faster is always better right? But it's worth being aware that you won't <em>always</em> see these improvements for pooling. Whenever you return a pooled object to the pool, it must "reset" its state, so that it's safe to reuse in another request. In some cases the time spent resetting an object may outweigh the savings made by not allocating a new object. There are also other subtle potential pitfalls.</p> <p>Nevertheless, having "native" support for using pooling in the DI container is an interesting idea, so I will show an approach to implementing this in my next post.</p> <h3 id="time-based-drifter-services" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#time-based-drifter-services" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Time-based (drifter) services</a></h3> <p>The final lifetime was described by Khalid as the "drifter" lifetime. He described it as somewhere between a scoped and transient lifetime—it's just in town for a short time before it moves on.</p> <p>More concretely, I thought of it as a time-based service, as it essentially "lives" for a fixed period of time. For a specific period of time (until the timeout expires), whenever you request an instance of this service, you get the same item, so it behaves a <em>bit</em> like a scoped service. However, once the timeout is exceeded, you get a new instance of the type.</p> <blockquote> <p>I struggle to think of a good example of when you would want to do this in practice. It sounds a <em>bit</em> like a cache, where you want to "refresh" the data (by getting a new instance) after a given period of time. But I would be more likely to implement that as a singleton type, where the data is refreshed in a background thread. 🤷‍♂️</p> </blockquote> <p>Just for fun, I wondered what it would be like to expose this time-based lifetime as a concept in the .NET DI container. As it turns out, creating a naïve implementation is pretty easy, but there are a whole raft of subtleties to making something practical and safe!</p> <h2 id="implementing-a-simple-time-based-lifetime-service" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#implementing-a-simple-time-based-lifetime-service" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Implementing a simple time-based lifetime service</a></h2> <p>To reiterate, I decided that a useful time-based lifetime service should have the following characteristics:</p> <ul><li>All requests within a given scope should use the same instance of the service (so it behaves similarly to a scoped lifetime service).</li> <li>After the service timeout expires, a new instance of the type should be created when requested.</li></ul> <p>The net result is that instances of time-based lifetime services may or may not be reused across requests.</p> <h3 id="implementing-timeddependencyfactoryt" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#implementing-timeddependencyfactoryt" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Implementing <code>TimedDependencyFactory&lt;T&gt;</code></a></h3> <p>To implement the lifetime, I used a factory pattern. The factory is responsible for creating new instances of the dependency, but also for caching the current instance for as long as the defined time lifespan.</p> <blockquote> <p>The naïve implementation of the factory is very simple, but to make the factory thread safe and ensure we don't create more than one instance of the dependency at a time, we can use a few interesting approaches.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another point to note is that I chose to use <a href="/exploring-the-dotnet-8-preview-avoiding-flaky-tests-with-timeprovider-and-itimer/">the <code>TimeProvider</code> abstraction</a> introduced in .NET 8, which makes it possible to test the behaviour of the factory while avoiding flaky tests.

The problem is that the DI container automatically calls <code>Dispose</code> on any <code>IDisposable</code> instances it returns when a scope ends. This is a problem for us, because we don't <em>want</em> to dispose the dependency until <em>after</em> we replace it.</p> <blockquote> <p>I spent quite a long time trying to solve this issue, adding layers of "lease" objects and various approaches, but in all cases I couldn't get rid of the potential race conditions.

I went to some effort to avoid creating multiple instances when the timeout expires and you create a replacement instance, either by using the <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> or a <code>lock()</code>. However, that <em>doesn't</em> mean that there's only ever one "active" instance of the service.</p> <p>For example, one slow request may be using instance A, during which time, the timeout expires. A second request is received, and as the timeout has expired, the factory creates a new instance, instance B. While the original request is executing, both instances A and B are in active use.</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/multiple_instances2.svg" alt="Demonstrating the problem that multiple instance may be active at the same time"></p> <p>If those issues aren't a problem for you, then you <em>should</em> be able to use the above implementation, but as I don't have a great handle on a real-life use case, I'm not sure whether these limitations are likely to be an issue or not!</p> <h2 id="summary" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#summary" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Summary</a></h2> <p>In this post I provided a brief introduction to the lifetimes available in the <em>Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection</em> abstraction used in ASP.NET Core.

However, both implementations had a large flaw: you can't use this approach with <code>IDisposable</code> services, as the service may be disposed while it's still in use in a different request.

The headers instruct browsers to activate or disable various features, with the overall goal of hardening your application and reducing your attack surface area.</p> <p>Some of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security">these headers</a> apply to all HTTP responses, while <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy">others</a> only really make sense for HTML responses. Nevertheless, it <em>can</em> make sense to apply theoretically-HTML-only headers to non-HTML responses as part of a defence-in-depth approach, <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#security-headers">as described by OWASP</a>.</p> <p>The main problem with security headers is that there are <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html#security-headers">a <em>lot</em> of them</a>, and the list is generally growing and evolving, with new headers being introduced and others being retired.

</code></pre> <p>The <code>SecurityHeadersMiddleware</code> registers a callback that adds several headers to all responses. By default, the middleware adds the following header to your responses:</p> <ul><li><code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code></li> <li><code>X-Frame-Options: Deny</code></li> <li><code>Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin</code></li> <li><code>Content-Security-Policy: object-src 'none'; form-action 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'</code></li> <li><code>Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains</code> - <em>only applied to HTTPS responses</em></li> <li><code>Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin</code></li> <li><code>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless</code></li> <li><code>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin</code></li></ul> <p>These headers were chosen based on <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html#security-headers">guidance from OWASP</a> to provide security hardening benefits, while being broadly applicable to most applications.</p> <blockquote> <p>These headers don't represent the <em>most</em> secure set you could choose, but rather a "generally safe" set for most applications. Ideally you should customise these headers to add a more secure (and more restrictive) set.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you want to change the headers that are applied, you can create an instance of <code>HeaderPolicyCollection</code>, and use the fluent builder interface to customize the added headers. The following shows an example which specifically adds all the default headers independently, and then adds an extra custom header.</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token class-name"><span class="token keyword">var</span></span> policyCollection <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token constructor-invocation class-name">HeaderPolicyCollection</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

</code></pre> <p>For most of the history of <em>NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</em>, this was been the only way to configure the security headers for your application. The advantage is that it's <em>simple</em>—there's no services to add, nothing to "reason" about—whatever headers you configure, are added.</p> <p>However, some people wanted more control, for example to be able to add different headers to different endpoints in their application, or to customize the headers on a request-by-request basis. That flexibility is largely what the changes in <code>1.0.0</code> are about, but as this is a major version, I took the opportunity to make some other larger changes too.</p> <p>For the rest of this post I'll describe some of the biggest changes in <code>1.0.0</code>.</p> <h2 id="major-changes-in-1-0-0" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#major-changes-in-1-0-0" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Major changes in <code>1.0.0</code></a></h2> <p>The following sections describe the high level changes and features included in <code>1.0.0</code>. Before we get started, the first thing to note is that <em>NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</em> finally <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders/issues/194">has a logo</a>:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2024/headers_logo.png" alt="NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders"></p> <p>A big thanks to <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@khalidabuhakmeh@mastodon.social">Khalid</a> for putting that together <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@khalidabuhakmeh@mastodon.social/113205536777140020">so quickly</a>! Now lets look at the new features and breaking changes.</p> <h3 id="changes-to-the-supported-frameworks" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#changes-to-the-supported-frameworks" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Changes to the supported frameworks</a></h3> <p>I first created <em>NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</em> way back in 2016, when ASP.NET Core was just being released. Back then, ASP.NET Core could <em>also</em> be run on .NET Framework. The original thought was that this mode would serve as a migration path from ASP.NET to ASP.NET Core.</p> <p>That path is rarely recommended these days, and instead, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/inc/overview">a "strangler fig" pattern is recommended</a>. ASP.NET Core has not been supported on .NET Framework since version 2.1 (OK, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/servicing-release-advisory-aspnetcore-23/">ASP.NET Core 2.3 now</a>), and as such <code>1.0.0</code> of <em>NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</em> finally drops support for .NET Framework too, by <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders/pull/167">dropping support for <code>netstandard2.0</code></a> and everything prior to .NET Core 3.1.</p> <blockquote> <p>You might be wondering "why .NET Core 3.1+ and not .NET 8+, seeing as that's all that's supported by Microsoft". The short answer, is that supporting the extra TFMs requires basically no extra work, and it means more people can use the package. I'm not really losing anything by supporting the earlier TFMs. Sure, there's probably a few cases where I'd use different APIs if targeting .NET 8, but those are few and far between.</p> </blockquote> <p>Given the package still supports .NET Core 3.1+ it's <em>very</em> unlikely you'll be impacted by this change unless you're on a (very) unsupported version of .NET Core. And if you are, I would strongly advise you to update anyway!</p> <h3 id="changes-to-headers" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#changes-to-headers" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Changes to headers</a></h3> <p>In the next section I describe some of the changes to specific security headers, including changes to default values, new APIs, and deprecated methods.</p> <h4 id="changes-to-the-default-headers" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#changes-to-the-default-headers" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Changes to the default headers</a></h4> <p>When you don't specify a custom <code>HeaderPolicyCollection</code>, <em>NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</em> applies a default set of headers, as I described previously. These headers are encapsulated in the <code>AddDefaultSecurityHeaders()</code> extension method, so the following are equivalent:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">app<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">UseSecurityHeaders</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token comment">// 👈 This...</span>

The <code>X-XSS-Protection</code> header is interesting in that it's a security header that <em>used</em> to be recommended to add to your applications to improve security. However these days it's <em>not</em> recommended, because, as described on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection">MDN</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The <code>X-XSS-Protection</code> header "can create XSS vulnerabilities in otherwise safe websites"</p> </blockquote> <p>That's clearly not an example of a good header to add by default, so <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders/pull/168">it's been removed</a> from the default set of security headers and <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders/pull/191">marked obsolete</a>. You can still add it to your application if you want to, it's just not recommended unless you understand the risks.</p> <h4 id="expect-ct-is-no-longer-recommended" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#expect-ct-is-no-longer-recommended" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline"><code>Expect-CT</code> is no longer recommended</a></h4> <p>The <code>Expect-CT</code> header lets sites opt-in to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Certificate_Transparency">certificate transparency</a> requirements, but only Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers implemented Expect-CT, On top of that, Chromium deprecated the header in version 107 (Oct 2022), because <a href="https://chromestatus.com/feature/6244547273687040">Chromium now enforces CT by default</a>.</p> <p>Given the header is deprecated and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Expect-CT">no longer recommended</a>, it's <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders/pull/197">now marked obsolete in <em>NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</em></a>.</p> <h4 id="new-permisionspolicybuilder-adddefaultsecuredirectives-method" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#new-permisionspolicybuilder-adddefaultsecuredirectives-method" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">New <code>PermisionsPolicyBuilder.AddDefaultSecureDirectives()</code> method</a></h4> <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy"><code>Permissions-Policy</code> header</a> provides a way to allow or deny the browser from using various features, such as the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API">Web Bluetooth API</a> or the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy/camera">Camera</a>. Support for <code>Permissions-Policy</code> has been available for some time (with <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders/pull/177">many new policies added recently</a>).</p> <p>One slight annoyance with building up a <code>Permissions-Policy</code> is that there are so <em>many</em> policies. If you're building a JSON API (for example) then you'll likely want to disable <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#security-headers">essentially all of them</a>, at which point you're calling a <em>lot</em> of methods.</p> <p><code>1.0.0</code> adds two new convenience method that add (most) of <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#security-headers">the headers recommended by OWASP for REST endpoints</a>. If you just want to add the default set of directives you can call <code>AddPermissionsPolicyWithDefaultSecureDirectives()</code> directly on <code>HeaderPolicyCollection</code>:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token class-name"><span class="token keyword">var</span></span> policies <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token constructor-invocation class-name">HeaderPolicyCollection</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

screen-wake-lock=(), sync-xhr=(), usb=(), web-share=(), xr-spatial-tracking=()
</code></pre> <p>Note that this isn't quite the same set of headers <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#security-headers">as suggested by OWASP</a>, because <em>NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</em> doesn't include experimental features (to limit the scope and avoid too many breaking changes), but if you want to replicate those directives, you can always use the <code>AddCustomDirective()</code> helper.</p> <h4 id="new-support-for-trusted-types" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#new-support-for-trusted-types" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">New support for Trusted Types</a></h4> <p>The Trusted Types directive is part of the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) feature to prevent against cross-site-scripting (XSS) attacks. By using the Trusted Types APIs, in combination with the Trusted Types directive, you can prevent cross-site scripting attacks that use DOM-based attacks by leveraging dangerous APIs.</p> <blockquote> <p>If you're new to the Trusted Types APIs, you can <a href="/preventing-client-side-cross-site-scripting-vulnerabilities-with-trusted-types/">read about them in my post here</a> that shows how the attacks work and how the CSP can protect you. It's worth noting that the Trusted Types API is currently only available in Chromium based browsers, but it has been available in Chromium since version 83, released in 2020.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can <a href="/preventing-client-side-cross-site-scripting-vulnerabilities-with-trusted-types/#blocking-cross-site-scripting-with-trusted-types-and-a-content-security-policy">add a trusted types directive</a> to your CSP with <em>NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</em> using the <code>AddRequireTrustedTypesFor()</code> method.

The <code>ApplyDocumentHeadersToContentTypes()</code> and <code>ApplyDocumentHeadersToAllResponses()</code> extension methods have now been marked <code>[Obsolete]</code> and are no-ops.</p> <p>These methods were originally added because some security headers don't really make <em>sense</em> when applied to passive content like JSON responses compared to HTML responses. Consequently, by default, some security headers (such as <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>) would be omitted unless the response was HTML or JavaScript.</p> <p>The only real benefit to this approach was that it reduced the size of the response (by omitting some headers). The down-side was that it added confusion and an additional configuration knob people had to consider. What's more, <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#security-headers">OWASP actually recommends you <em>do</em> send these headers</a>, even if you have no intention of returning HTML, as part of a defence-in-depth approach. What's more, some of the headers that were previously considered "document/HTML only" actually <em>should</em> be added to all responses to protect against <a href="https://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Clickjacking_Threats#Drag_and_drop_attacks">drag-and-drop style clickjacking attacks</a>.</p> <p>So in <code>1.0.0</code> the concept of a <code>DocumentHeaderPolicy</code> has been removed, and headers are <em>always</em> applied to <em>all</em> requests regardless of the response content type.</p> <blockquote> <p>Mostly…some headers only apply to HTTPS requests for example, or should not be applied to <code>localhost</code> requests. But the "document header" concept is no more.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you want to re-instate the "document header" functionality for some reason, you can recreate something similar with <code>SetPolicySelector()</code>.

However, with the changes in <code>1.0.0</code> it's no longer possible to know ahead of time that a nonce will be required (because the header policies can change later in the request, due to a named endpoint policy for example).</p> <p>As a result, the nonce is no longer generated at the <em>start</em> of the request. Instead, it's generated lazily when you call <code>HttpContext.GetNonce()</code>. The end result is the same as before—a single nonce is generated per-request, and only when it's required. The slight breaking change is the fact that you now <em>must</em> call <code>GetNonce()</code> to retrieve the nonce. Previously you <em>could</em> have retrieved the nonce directly from <code>HttpContext.Items</code> (even though that wasn't explicitly supported); in <code>1.0.0</code> that's no longer possible.</p> <p>That covers the majority of the major changes made between versions <code>0.24.0</code> and <code>1.0.0</code>.

I describe how it is meant to work, explain the output format, and demonstrate my attempt to test it with a small app.</p> <h2 id="what-is-git-range-diff-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#what-is-git-range-diff-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">What is <code>git range-diff</code>?</a></h2> <p>I'm a big fan of <code>git rebase</code> for moving commits around, for cleaning up iterative work, for <a href="/working-with-stacked-branches-in-git-is-easier-with-update-refs/">working with stacked branches</a>, and for including recent changes on <code>main</code> into my feature branch.</p> <p>However, there's no denying that things can sometimes get confusing with <code>git rebase</code>. It's true that pretty much everything you do with <code>git rebase</code> can be reversed if you make a mistake, but it's not always obvious whether there <em>is</em> a mistake. This is particularly true when you've done a lot of interactive rebasing, when the branch you're rebasing <em>onto</em> has changed a lot, or when you have to resolve a bunch of merge conflicts.</p> <p>There are various sub-optimal approaches you could use to try to understand if a rebase is "correct", but from my experience none of these work very well, either because they're confusing, hard to do, or simply don't produce an easy to understand result.</p> <p><code>git range-diff</code> is meant to help with exactly this scenario. It can be used to compare two <em>ranges</em> of commits (compared to <code>git diff</code> which compares the state at two different commits directly). It's best to think of <code>git range-diff</code> as performing a <code>diff</code> of two <code>git-diff</code>s—because that's literally how it works behind the scenes!</p> <p>In theory, this makes it possible to compare a stack of commits <em>prior</em> to rebasing with the stack of commits <em>after</em> rebasing and to show the differences between them. If the rebase was simply rearranging and squashing commits then you would expect the diffs to be identical, and the diff of diffs would show that.</p> <p>On the other hand, if you had to handle merge conflicts as part of the rebase, or if you rebased onto a different commit, then you might <em>expect</em> there to be changes, and these would be shown by <code>git range-diff</code></p> <h2 id="using-git-range-diff" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#using-git-range-diff" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Using <code>git range-diff</code></a></h2> <p>At the end of the post I'll show a real worked example of <code>git range-diff</code>, but the basic syntax (in the most useful form IMO) is as follows:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">git</span> range-diff base1<span class="token punctuation">..</span>head1 base2<span class="token punctuation">..</span>head2
</code></pre> <p>where you have a git commit tree that looks something the following</p> <pre class="language-git"><code class="language-git">                    h-i-head2
                   /
a-b-c-base1-d-e-base2
        \
         f-g-head1
</code></pre> <p>So for the example above, <code>git range-diff</code> essentially does the following:</p> <ul><li>Perform a <code>git diff base1..head1</code> (i.e. <code>base1</code>, <code>f</code>, <code>g</code>, and <code>head1</code>), and generate a "patch"</li> <li>Perform a <code>git diff base2..head2</code> (i.e. <code>base2</code>, <code>h</code>, <code>i</code>, and <code>head2</code>), and generate a "patch"</li> <li>Perform a <code>git diff</code> between the two patches</li></ul> <p><code>git range-diff</code> Compares the content of the files, but then also compares the <em>order</em> of the commits, and the metadata in those commits, such as the commit messages. The resulting output is, frankly, quite confusing, so I'll walk through what it means in the next section.</p> <h2 id="understanding-the-output-format" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#understanding-the-output-format" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Understanding the output format</a></h2> <p>As mentioned above, the output format of <code>git range-diff</code> can be pretty hard to understand in my experience. The image below is taken from <a href="https://github.blog/open-source/git/highlights-from-git-2-19/">a GitHub blog post</a> and shows a relatively simple example of the expected output</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/range_diff.webp" alt="A git range-diff output"></p> <p>The output shows the series of commits that are being compared, and indicates whether commits have been reordered, and shows any difference in the commits between the two ranges. We'll dig more into the "diff" part shortly, but first let's just look at the commit list itself. I've added a header so we can describe each section subsequently:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token operator">|</span>     <span class="token number">2</span>  <span class="token operator">|</span><span class="token number">3</span><span class="token operator">|</span><span class="token number">4</span><span class="token operator">|</span>     <span class="token number">5</span>   <span class="token operator">|</span>    <span class="token number">6</span>

</code></pre> <p>This output shows how the commits in the two branches have changed, been reordered, been added or removed. From left-to-right, these sections are as follows:</p> <ol><li>The position of the left-hand side commit in the commit range being compared. For example, <code>2</code> indicates it was the second commit in the commit list. <code>-</code> indicates no matching commit was found in the left hand side commit range.</li> <li>The short commit hash for the left-hand commit.</li> <li>The equality of the commits being compared. <code>=</code> indicates they are equal, <code>!</code> means they were different, <code>&gt;</code> means it was only in the right-hand side, <code>&lt;</code> means it was only on the left-hand side.</li> <li>The position of the right-hand side commit in the commit range being compared. In the example above, you can see that the second commit on the left was matched to the second commit on the right.</li> <li>The short commit hash for the right-hand commit. Even for "equal" commits, these hashes are likely to differ as the commits may have different parents.</li> <li>The commit message for the commits. If the commits differ, the right-hand-side message is shown and a diff for the commit message is shown.</li></ol> <p>In the image above, we can see that the order of the first two commits have been swapped by comparing the commit orders. The fourth commit on the right-hand side was not present in the left-hand side range.</p> <p>The third commit is where things get interesting. The commit list shows that the commit on the left and right were matched, but not equal (indicated by <code>!</code>). Whenever you have inequality like this, <code>git range-diff</code> provides a diff of what changed.</p> <p>The first part of the difference was in the commit message, which shows:</p> <pre class="language-diff"><code class="language-diff"><span class="token coord">@@ -2,7 +2,7 @@</span>
<span class="token unchanged"><span class="token prefix unchanged"> </span><span class="token line">    hello: fix typo

</span></span><span class="token inserted-sign inserted"><span class="token prefix inserted">+</span><span class="token line">   "Hello" has two l's. Let's also fix the missing newline.
</span></span></code></pre> <p>This is a pretty standard <code>git diff</code> format between the left- and right-hand side commits. It indicates that we added the text <code>Let's also fix the missing newline.</code> to the commit message.</p> <p>Where things get more complicated is in comparing the diffs of the commit. Remember, <code>git range-diff</code> is a "diff of diffs", and diffs <em>already</em> contain <code>-</code> and <code>+</code> prefixes at the start of the line. So <code>git range-diff</code> has <em>double</em> prefixes: 😅</p> <pre class="language-diff"><code class="language-diff">diff --git a/hello.c b/hello.c
<span class="token coord">--- a/hello.c</span>
<span class="token coord">@@ -12,6 +12,6 @@</span>

</span><span class="token prefix unchanged"> </span><span class="token line">   }
</span></span></code></pre> <p>Let's think about what this means. <em>Only</em> the left-hand most column, i.e. left-most prefix, indicates a <em>difference</em> between the two sides. The first line with any prefix only has a single <code>-</code> character:</p> <pre class="language-diff"><code class="language-diff"><span class="token unchanged"><span class="token prefix unchanged"> </span><span class="token line">-      printf("Helo world");
</span></span></code></pre> <p>That means that <em>both</em> commits removed this line, so there's <em>no</em> difference_ between the commit ranges for this line. In contrast, the next two lines have two prefix symbols:</p> <pre class="language-diff"><code class="language-diff"><span class="token deleted-sign deleted"><span class="token prefix deleted">-</span><span class="token line">+      printf("Hello world");
</span></span><span class="token inserted-sign inserted"><span class="token prefix inserted">+</span><span class="token line">+      printf("Hello world\n");
</span></span></code></pre> <p>The first of these lines starts with <code>-+</code>, which means the left-hand side commit <em>was</em> adding this commit, but the right hand side no longer is. Conversely, the <code>++</code> indicates the right-hand side is <em>newly</em> adding this line.</p> <p>Remembering these suffixes is difficult, so the following table describes what the symbols mean</p> <table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:right">Prefix symbol</th><th>Left-hand commit</th><th>Right-hand commit</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:right">(None)</td><td>No change</td><td>No change</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right"><code> -</code></td><td>Removed the line</td><td>Removed the line</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right"><code> +</code></td><td>Added the line</td><td>Added the line</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right"><code>+-</code></td><td>No change</td><td>Removes the line</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right"><code>++</code></td><td>No change</td><td>Adds the line</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right"><code>--</code></td><td>Removed the line</td><td>"Removes the removal", so no longer removes the line.<br> i.e. it adds the line back that the left hand side removed.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right"><code>-+</code></td><td>Added the line</td><td>"Removes the add", so no longer adds the line.<br> i.e. it removes the line that the left hand side added.</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>I think it's quite difficult to intuitively remember the behaviours here. The best I can achieve is working through the logic of the above table 😅</p> <p>The <code>git range-diff</code> output <em>does</em> try to help guide your understanding by only highlighting the <em>first</em> character in the prefix, i.e. lines that are actually different between left and right, as opposed to changes that appear in both diffs.</p> <p>Note that if you <em>only</em> want to see the changes in the commit list, and don't want to see the full diff then you can use the <code>-s</code> or <code>--no-patch</code> arguments, Using something like the following:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">git</span> range-diff --no-patch base1<span class="token punctuation">..</span>head1 base2<span class="token punctuation">..</span>head2

<span class="token function">git</span> range-diff <span class="token parameter variable">-s</span> base1<span class="token punctuation">..</span>head1 base2<span class="token punctuation">..</span>head2
</code></pre> <p>In the next section I show the experience I found testing out <code>git range-diff</code> on a small sample.</p> <h2 id="trying-it-out-in-a-small-sample" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#trying-it-out-in-a-small-sample" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Trying it out in a small sample</a></h2> <p>Whenever I discover a new git feature, I like to try it out in small samples to try to get an initial feeling for it. I then expand to larger projects later once I have a handle on how the feature works. Unfortunately, for <code>git range-diff</code> I was not very impressed with what I found. I think that's partly just because the output of <code>git range-diff</code> is relatively hard to parse. But there are also some aspects that seem generally ill-suited to the very small diffs I've used in this example.</p> <h3 id="setting-up-a-simple-test-app" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#setting-up-a-simple-test-app" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Setting up a simple test app</a></h3> <p>The test app I used is a vey simple minimal API project.

The only commit that <code>git</code> thinks is "equal" is Commit 1, which adds the <code>Example</code> record in a separate file. It's particularly interesting that <code>Commit 2</code> is not recognized as matching, given that the diff prior to the rebase was</p> <pre class="language-diff"><code class="language-diff"><span class="token unchanged"><span class="token prefix unchanged"> </span><span class="token line">var app = builder.Build();

</span></span></code></pre> <p>Pretty similar, no!?</p> <p>The important thing to understand about <code>range-diff</code> is that it <em>doesn't</em> just diff the <code>-/+</code> lines, it's diffing the <em>whole</em> diff patch, <em>including</em> the context lines. If you look back at the previous two diffs, you can see that the existing changes on <code>main</code> mean that the unchanged lines in the diffs look significantly different from one another.</p> <p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-range-diff#_algorithm">The algorithm</a> git uses has a "fudge factor" to determine how similar two diffs must be for them to be considered "equal". You can tweak this value wit the <code>--creation-factor</code>, which must be a value between 0-100 (default is 60). The higher the value, the more likely git is to find matches.</p> <p>For example, if we run the same comparison with <code>--creation-factor=90</code>, we get a very different <code>range-diff</code> (note that I'm hiding the diff patches here for brevity, the subsequent image shows the diff in all its glory)</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span>  <span class="token function">git</span> range-diff base<span class="token punctuation">..</span>my_feature_bak main<span class="token punctuation">..</span>my_feature --creation-factor<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">90</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-s</span>

</code></pre> <p>The results here look much closer to what we actually expect; <code>Commit 2</code> is matched in both branches for example. I think the full diff is still somewhat confusing however:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/range_diff_05.png" alt="The range-diff with --creation-factor=90"></p> <p>Take a moment to try to parse this output. Both of the commit diffs highlight that there are differences related to the <code>/</code> and <code>/{name}</code> endpoints. That's expected, because those changes were introduced in the <code>main</code> branch, and so are present in the rebased branch, but <em>not</em> in the "prior" scenario.</p> <p>Where things look a bit strange are on the first lines in the diff:</p> <pre class="language-diff"><code class="language-diff"><span class="token deleted-sign deleted"><span class="token prefix deleted">-</span><span class="token line">@@ Program.cs: var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
</span><span class="token prefix deleted">-</span><span class="token line"> var app = builder.Build();
</span></span><span class="token inserted-sign inserted"><span class="token prefix inserted">+</span><span class="token line">@@ Program.cs: var names = new ConcurrentDictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();
</span><span class="token prefix inserted">+</span><span class="token line"> app.MapGet("/", () =&gt; names.Keys.Select(n =&gt; $"Hello {n}!"));
</span></span></code></pre> <p>When I first look at that diff, it <em>looks</em> like it's saying that the lines <code>var app = builder.Build();</code> etc have been <em>removed</em> from the rebased commit stack, which would obviously be an error. However, it's more complicated than that. Remember git does a very crude <code>git diff</code> of the commit <em>patch</em>, which means it's also diffing the <em>context</em>. That's what we have here—differences in the context.</p> <p>Due to the changes in <code>main</code> the context around the changed lines (<code>/example</code>) are fundamentally different, and <em>that's</em> what's showing up here.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I'm not sure there's a good fix for that. This is integral to how <code>git range-diff</code> works, so I think the only answer is getting comfortable with the confusing output. The main thing I wonder is whether I'd be able to spot a genuine merge-conflict error amongst this noise. I guess time will tell, as I try this in realistic scenarios. Given that the Linux kernel uses it, I think it's safe to say it's certainly possible to use it successfully!</p> <h2 id="summary" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#summary" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Summary</a></h2> <p>In this post I looked at the <code>git range-diff</code> feature. I discuss the scenarios it's designed to help with, and how it works as a diff-of-diffs. Next I explained the output format it uses, which can be difficult to parse thanks to the confusion in showing a diff-of-diff patches. Finally I tried out the feature on a small toy sample in which I rebased a branch and resolved merge conflicts. In my test example, the result was very dependent on the "fudge factor" parameter, and the output was difficult to discern genuine changes from changes in the surrounding context. I suspect it may be primarily a case of needing practice to read the output on my part.</p> ]]></content:encoded><category><![CDATA[Git]]></category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Creating SBOM attestations in GitHub Actions]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this post I show how you can create attestations for SBOM documents that you have created for your application or Nuget package]]></description><link>https://andrewlock.net/creating-sbom-attestations-in-github-actions/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://andrewlock.net/creating-sbom-attestations-in-github-actions/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew Lock]]></dc:creator><media:content url="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/sbom_attest_banner.png" medium="image" /><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/sbom_attest_banner.png" /><p>In this post I show how you can create attestations for SBOM documents that you have created for your application or Nuget package.</p> <h2 id="supply-chain-security-and-attestations" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#supply-chain-security-and-attestations" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Supply chain security and attestations</a></h2> <p>In the last couple of posts on my blog, I've been looking at some of the potential steps you can take to be a good citizen in the software ecosystem by providing confidence in the artifacts you produce. In particular, I've been looking at some of the steps you can take related to software provenance.</p> <p>Initially, I looked at <a href="/creating-provenance-attestations-for-nuget-packages-in-github-actions/">how you can produce provenance attestations</a> for your NuGet packages (or other applications), by adding an easy-to-use GitHub Action to your build workflow.</p> <blockquote> <p>A <a href="https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/provenance">provenance <em>attestation</em></a> provides a common format for describing how your artifact was built, the environment it was built in, the build definition that produced it, the build <em>run</em> that produced it, and more.</p> </blockquote> <p>Providing an attestation doesn't automatically improve the security of downstream projects consuming your NuGet package; consumers must make sure they <em>verify</em> the attestation, but it provides one building block for securing the software supply chain.</p> <p>In <a href="/creating-a-software-bill-of-materials-sbom-for-an-open-source-nuget-package/">the subsequent post</a> I showed how you can create a <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sbom">Software Bill of Materials</a> (SBOM). I used a variety of different tools, and showed how the resulting document varies somewhat based on the tool you use, but they all provide a standard document that can be processed by machines.</p> <blockquote> <p>An SBOM describes the various packages and dependencies that go into creating a software artifact such as an application or a package. An SBOM gives visibility into what components your software contains, including any components with known vulnerabilities, as well as any potential compliance or licensing issues or supply chain risks.</p> </blockquote> <p>In this post, I show how you can combine the two concepts. As well as providing provenance attestations for your package itself, you can <em>also</em> provide attestations for the SBOM associated with the package. This ensures that consumers can trust that the SBOM provided has not been tampered with, and provides guarantees about when, where, and how it was generated.</p> <h2 id="generating-attestations-for-an-sbom" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#generating-attestations-for-an-sbom" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Generating attestations for an SBOM</a></h2> <p>The good news is that if you've already followed the previous two posts, you're already most of the way there. In the <a href="/creating-provenance-attestations-for-nuget-packages-in-github-actions/">first post about generating attestations</a>, I showed <a href="https://github.com/actions/attest-build-provenance">the <code>actions/attest-build-provenance</code> GitHub Action</a> you can use to generate provenance for an artifact. In this post, we use <a href="https://github.com/actions/attest-sbom">the <code>actions/attest-sbom</code> GitHub action</a> that generates a signed SBOM attestation for SBOMs.</p> <p>As a reminder, there are a variety of standard formats you can choose for an SBOM, but two of the most popular appear to be <a href="https://spdx.dev/">System Package Data Exchange</a> (SPDX) and <a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX</a>. Both of these formats have a JSON document option, are specified as standards (<a href="https://spdx.dev/use/specifications/">ISO/IEC 5692:2021</a> for SPDX, <a href="https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-424/">ECMA-424</a> for CycloneDX), and can be generated using a wide variety of open source tools.</p> <p>The <code>actions/attest-sbom</code> GitHub action works with both SPDX and CycloneDX JSON documents, so you can use whichever tools you prefer to generate the SBOM. The attestation creation process itself is essentially identical to the flow used by <code>actions/attest-build-provenance</code> for artifact provenance, using GitHub's Sigstore client.</p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/content/images/2025/github_attestations.webp"> </picture><figcaption>The Github attestation method.

The details of <em>how</em> it generates the SBOM aren't important at this stage (see <a href="/creating-a-software-bill-of-materials-sbom-for-an-open-source-nuget-package/">the previous post</a> from some possible approaches). All that matters here is that we have the artifact, and we have the corresponding SBOM.</p> <p>The following initial workflow builds a .NET NuGet package and generates a CycloneDX SBOM JSON document using <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cyclonedx-net-generate-sbom">the <code>CycloneDX/gh-dotnet-generate-sbom</code> GitHub Action</a>.

</code></pre> <p>Unfortunately, as I described in a <a href="/creating-provenance-attestations-for-nuget-packages-in-github-actions/#and-now-for-the-bad-news">previous post on attestations</a>, verifying the provenance of NuGet packages uploaded to nuget.org is a bit more problematic.</p> <h3 id="the-nuget-signing-issue" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#the-nuget-signing-issue" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">The NuGet signing issue</a></h3> <p>As I described in a <a href="/creating-provenance-attestations-for-nuget-packages-in-github-actions/#and-now-for-the-bad-news">previous post on attestations</a>, nuget.org modifies the <em>.nupkg</em> files that you upload, modifying their contents to add a signature file. Unfortunately changing the file like means that the provenance attestation and SBOM attestations are no longer valid for the file, which significantly reduces the usefulness of the attestations.</p> <p>It's possible to restore <em>some</em> packages downloaded from nuget.org to their previous state, <a href="/creating-provenance-attestations-for-nuget-packages-in-github-actions/#update-the-redemption-arc">as I showed previously</a>. For example, on Linux you can use the <code>zip</code> utility to delete the <em>.signature.p7s</em> file added by nuget.org:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token assign-left variable">file</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.1.0.0-preview.4.nupkg"</span>

<span class="token comment"># Delete the .signature.p7s file that nuget.org adds to the package</span>
<span class="token function">zip</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-d</span> <span class="token variable">$file</span> .signature.p7s
</code></pre> <p>Unfortunately this doesn't work for <em>all</em> packages. If a package is <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/sign-a-package"><em>author</em> signed</a>, then the <em>.signature.p7s</em> file will be part of the <em>.nupkg</em> file <em>before</em> it's uploaded to nuget.org. The hash of the file at this point is what will be used to generate the provenance and SBOM attestations.</p> <p>When you upload the package to nuget.org, it adds a repository counter-signature, <em>modifying</em> the <em>.signature.p7s</em> file. That means you can't "simply" remove the .signature.p7s file to restore the original file. Unfortunately, I'm not sure there's a good solution to creating provenance attestations for the packages in this case; you'll essentially never be able to reliably verify the provenance, rendering them essentially pointless (as they could be easily forged).</p> <blockquote> <p>The good news in all this is that the author and repository signatures are intended to serve a <em>similar</em> purpose to the attestations. In many ways they're the "NuGet native" solution to the problem. However they don't tie an artifact to a <em>specific</em> CI execution in the same way that the GitHub attestations do.</p> </blockquote> <p>All of that is to say that generating attestations does not seem particularly useful in the .NET and NuGet ecosystems right now. <em>Generating</em> the attestations, as I've shown in this post, is not too difficult. However <em>consuming</em> and <em>verifying</em> the attestations is another story, and not one that NuGet provides good support for at this point.</p> <h2 id="summary" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#summary" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Summary</a></h2> <p>In this post I built on top of the previous two posts about provenance attestations and software bills of materials (SBOM). This post showed how to combine the two concepts, producing provenance attestations for your SBOM documents. These provide confidence to consumers that a given SBOM document was generated for a specific artifact. I showed how you can use the <code>actions/attest-sbom</code> GitHub Action to attest SPDX and CycloneDX SBOMs, and how to verify the generated attestations. Finally, I discussed the problem with NuGet packages uploaded to nuget.org, and why verifying attestations for these <em>nupkg</em> files is difficult.</p> ]]></content:encoded><category><![CDATA[Security;NuGet;GitHub;DevOps]]></category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Creating a software bill of materials (SBOM) for an open-source NuGet package]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this post I discuss several tools you can use to create a software bill of materials (SBOM) for an application or a NuGet package]]></description><link>https://andrewlock.net/creating-a-software-bill-of-materials-sbom-for-an-open-source-nuget-package/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://andrewlock.net/creating-a-software-bill-of-materials-sbom-for-an-open-source-nuget-package/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew Lock]]></dc:creator><media:content url="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/sbom_banner.png" medium="image" /><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/sbom_banner.png" /><p>In this post I discuss several tools you can use to create a software bill of materials (SBOM) for an application or a NuGet package. I demonstrate GitHub's built-in "Export SBOM" button, Microsoft's open source <code>sbom-tool</code>, the <code>anchore/sbom-action</code> GitHub Action, and finally the CycloneDX module for .NET.</p> <h2 id="what-is-a-software-bill-of-materials-sbom-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#what-is-a-software-bill-of-materials-sbom-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">What is a software bill of materials (SBOM)?</a></h2> <p>In standard manufacturing, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials">bill of materials</a> is a list of all the raw-materials, components, and parts needed to manufacture the end product. A <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sbom">Software Bill of Materials</a> (SBOM) is essentially the same thing, but for software. It describes the various packages and dependencies that go into creating a software artifact such as an application or a package.</p> <p>SBOMs are useful both for people building software and for people consuming or operating the software. An SBOM gives visibility into what components your software contains, including any components with known vulnerabilities, as well as any potential compliance or licensing issues or supply chain risks.</p> <p>There are a variety of SBOM formats to choose from, but two of the most popular appear to be <a href="https://spdx.dev/">System Package Data Exchange</a> (SPDX) and <a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX</a>. Both of these formats have a JSON document option, are specified as standards (<a href="https://spdx.dev/use/specifications/">ISO/IEC 5692:2021</a> for SPDX, <a href="https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-424/">ECMA-424</a> for CycloneDX), and can be generated using a wide variety of open source tools.</p> <p>I was interested in how easy it would be to generate an SBOM for one of my open source .NET NuGet packages. I tried a few of the available tools to see how easy they would be to use and to see what the generated SBOM looks like. In the following sections I show how to get started with the following tools</p> <ul><li><a href="#microsoft-s-sbom-tool">Microsoft's SBOM tool</a></li> <li><a href="#github-action-anchore-sbom-action-using-syft">Syft via the <code>anchore/sbom-action</code> GitHub Action</a></li> <li><a href="#cyclonedx-module-for-net">CycloneDX's .NET module</a></li></ul> <p>It's also worth noting that you can download an SBOM directly from a GitHub repository by going to <strong>Insights</strong> &gt; <strong>Dependency Graph</strong>, and clicking <strong>Export SBOM</strong>:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/sbom_00.png" alt="The Export SBOM "></p> <p>Clicking this button downloads an SPDX JSON document, that looks something like this following:</p> <pre class="language-json"><code class="language-json"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>

</code></pre> <p>This is only a tiny fraction of the output, but it shows a couple of important points:</p> <ul><li>The SPDX format includes a relatively large amount of data, including copyright text and other details.</li> <li>The GitHub Dependency Graph SBOM includes <em>all</em> the packages used in your project, including test projects, sample projects, and any GitHub actions.</li></ul> <p>That latter point may or may not be what you want to include in your SBOM. The test package dependencies aren't ever <em>used</em> or <em>shipped</em> as a dependency of the final artifact, but they <em>are</em> a dependency of your project as a whole.</p> <blockquote> <p>Personally I wouldn't expect to see them in an SBOM for a project, but then I've not needed to provide an SBOM for any regulatory purposes in practice, so I'm not sure what the expectation is here.</p> </blockquote> <p>Assuming that you want something more automated, read on to see how the other tools I tried faired.</p> <h2 id="microsoft-s-sbom-tool" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#microsoft-s-sbom-tool" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Microsoft's SBOM tool</a></h2> <p>Some of the first information I found when looking for a .NET SBOM tool was <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/engineering-at-microsoft/microsoft-open-sources-software-bill-of-materials-sbom-generation-tool/">this blog post from 2022</a>, announcing that Microsoft was open-sourcing its SBOM tool. You can find <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sbom-tool">their sbom tool on GitHub</a>. As described in the readme:</p> <blockquote> <p>The SBOM tool is a highly scalable and enterprise ready tool to create SPDX 2.2 compatible SBOMs for any variety of artifacts. The tool uses the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/component-detection">Component Detection</a> libraries to detect components and the <a href="https://github.com/clearlydefined/clearlydefined">ClearlyDefined API</a> to populate license information for these components.</p> </blockquote> <p>Microsoft's tool is clearly going to be appealing to .NET developers, <em>especially</em> as <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sbom-tool?tab=readme-ov-file#sbom-net-tool">it's available as a .NET tool</a>! They also include <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sbom-tool/blob/main/docs/setting-up-github-actions.md">explicit instructions for running the tool as a GitHub action</a>, as part of your CI process.</p> <p>I tried out the tool locally on my <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</a> project. First I installed the tool:</p> <pre class="language-powershell"><code class="language-powershell">dotnet tool install <span class="token operator">--</span>global Microsoft<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Sbom<span class="token punctuation">.</span>DotNetTool

You can invoke the tool <span class="token keyword">using</span> the following command: sbom-tool
Tool <span class="token string">'microsoft.sbom.dotnettool'</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>version <span class="token string">'3.1.0'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> was successfully installed<span class="token punctuation">.</span>
</code></pre> <p>If you run <code>sbom-tool</code> without any options, you'll see that there's a <em>huge</em> number of arguments:</p> <pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">The Sbom tool generates a SBOM for any build artifact.

Usage - Microsoft.Sbom.DotNetTool &lt;action&gt; -options

GlobalOption    Description
Help (-?, -h)   Prints this help message

Actions

  Validate -options - Validate a build artifact using the manifest. Optionally also verify the signing certificate of the manifest.

    Option                   Description
    BuildDropPath (-b)       Specifies the root folder of the drop directory containing the final build artifacts
                             (binaries and executables) for which the SBOM file will be validated. This is the
                             directory where the completed build output is stored.
    ManifestDirPath (-m)     The path of the directory where the manifest will be validated. If this parameter is not
                             specified, the manifest will be validated in {BuildDropPath}/_manifest directory.
    OutputPath (-o)          The path where the output json should be written. ex: Path/output.json
    CatalogFilePath (-C)     This parameter is deprecated and will not be used, we will automatically detect the catalog
                             file using our standard directory structure. The path of signed catalog file that is used
                             to verify the signature of the manifest json file.
    ValidateSignature (-s)   If set, will validate the manifest using the signed catalog file.
    IgnoreMissing (-im)      If set, will not fail validation on the files presented in Manifest but missing on the disk.

</code></pre> <p>Again, I've only shown a tiny sample here, rest assured there's a <em>lot</em> of options😅 Nevertheless I iterated until I managed to convince the tool to give me some output. After building my packages, I ran the tool using the following arguments (explained in more detail below):</p> <pre class="language-powershell"><code class="language-powershell">sbom-tool generate \

</code></pre> <ul><li><code>-b</code> is <code>BuildDropPath</code>, the folder containing the final artifacts</li> <li><code>-bc</code> is <code>BuildComponentPath</code>, the path to the source code used to build the artifacts</li> <li><code>-pn</code> is <code>PackageName</code>, the name of the package</li> <li><code>-pv</code> is <code>PackageVersion</code>, the version of the package</li> <li><code>-ps</code> is <code>PackageSupplier</code>, the "supplier" of the package</li> <li><code>-pm</code> is <code>EnablePackageMetadataParsing</code>, to enable parsing license info from the package's metadata file</li></ul> <p>After the tool executes you can find a <em>manifest.spdx.json</em> file nested inside the "BuildDropPath" in a _<em>manifests</em> folder.

</code></pre> <p>It's worth noting that the <em>NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</em> package I'm testing here doesn't <em>actually</em> have any dependencies, so it probably wasn't the best choice for demonstration 😅 But also, with that in mind, you can see that the SPDX format is pretty verbose.</p> <p>Overall the tool wasn't too hard to use, but I can't really comment as to it's effectiveness. The one thing I would note is that it <em>didn't</em> seem to detect the development dependencies (e.g. StyleCop) used by the project. Whether or not these should be included in the SBOM doesn't seem to be entirely clear, but as far as I can tell, the <code>sbom-tool</code> <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sbom-tool/issues/592">is <em>meant</em> to include them</a>, so it's a bit surprising to not find them.</p> <p>Overall I found the <code>sbom-tool</code> relatively easy to use, but it feels like it's more designed for <em>applications</em> than for components, such as the "drop directory" nomenclature and behaviour. For example, my project produces multiple NuGet packages, but I couldn't see how to easily generate <em>separate</em> SBOMs for them when the <em>.nupkg</em> files are all output to the same directory. The <code>sbom-tool</code> seems to require moving each of the built packages into a separate folder if you want a separate SBOM for each package.</p> <h2 id="github-action-anchore-sbom-action-using-syft" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#github-action-anchore-sbom-action-using-syft" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">GitHub action <code>anchore/sbom-action</code> using Syft</a></h2> <p>The next tool I tested was a GitHub action called <a href="https://github.com/anchore/sbom-action"><code>anchore/sbom-action</code></a> that uses <a href="https://github.com/anchore/syft">Syft</a> to create an SBOM.</p> <p>The basic use instructions for the action are very simple - simply point the tool at a path, and specify where you want the resulting spdx file to be generated:</p> <pre class="language-yml"><code class="language-yml"><span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token key atrule">uses</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> anchore/sbom<span class="token punctuation">-</span>action@f325610c9f50a54015d37c8d16cb3b0e2c8f4de0 <span class="token comment"># v0.18.0</span>

</code></pre> <p>The eagle-eyed among you may notice that the <code>path</code> here is pointing to the <em>bin</em> folder instead of the <em>packages</em> folder. That's because <a href="https://github.com/anchore/syft/blob/main/syft/pkg/cataloger/dotnet/parse_dotnet_deps.go">Syft appears to rely on parsing the <em>deps.json</em> file</a> to identify dependencies. It's possible Syft can work with the <em>.nupkg</em> files directly, but I didn't explore that.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note that we're pinning to a specific commit hash in the action. This is important to avoid supply-chain attacks, such as <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/supply-chain-attack-on-popular-github-action-exposes-ci-cd-secrets/">the recent attack</a> on the <code>tj-actions/changed-files</code> action.</p> </blockquote> <p>The resulting SPDX file is even <em>more</em> verbose than the <code>sbom-tool</code> version.

</code></pre> <p>So top marks for this tool for simplicity, but I don't know, the verbosity bugged me 😅</p> <h2 id="cyclonedx-module-for-net" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#cyclonedx-module-for-net" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">CycloneDX module for .NET</a></h2> <p>That brings us to the final tool I tried, the <a href="https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-dotnet">CycloneDX module for .NET</a>. This is the only tool I tried that uses the CycloneDX format instead of the older SPDX format, and I have to say, I thought it was pretty nice and easy.</p> <p>Just like Microsoft's <code>sbom-tool</code>, the CycloneDX module is available as a .NET global tool, which makes it easy for .NET devs to use. Install the tool using:</p> <pre class="language-powershell"><code class="language-powershell">dotnet tool install <span class="token operator">--</span>global CycloneDX
</code></pre> <p>You can then execute the tool by providing a path to a <em>.csproj</em> file, along with any additional arguments. As before, there are a lot of possible options here, but I've listed the values I used along with their explanations</p> <pre class="language-powershell"><code class="language-powershell">dotnet-CycloneDX <span class="token punctuation">.</span>\src\NetEscapades<span class="token punctuation">.</span>AspNetCore<span class="token punctuation">.</span>SecurityHeaders\NetEscapades<span class="token punctuation">.</span>AspNetCore<span class="token punctuation">.</span>SecurityHeaders<span class="token punctuation">.</span>csproj \ <span class="token comment"># Path to the project to analyzer</span>

</code></pre> <p>Just comparing the CycloneDX output document to the previous SPDX document, the CycloneDX one seems much easier to understand, with fewer extraneous details. In practice, I doubt that will matter much, as these documents are meant to be parsed and processed by a machine rather than by humans. But I don't know, I guess I'm partial to a well formatted JSON document, as <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders/pull/222">this is the approach I settled on in the end</a> 😀.</p> <h2 id="summary" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#summary" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Summary</a></h2> <p>In this post I gave a brief introduction to SBOMs, including what they are, why they're useful, and a couple of standard formats used to define an SBOM.

I then show you can use GitHub actions to easily create a signed attestation when creating a NuGet package in GitHub Actions. The same process applies for applications too, but in this post I focus on creating an attestation for a single library. Make sure you read to the end though, as there's a n unfortunate conclusion to the story</p> <h2 id="what-is-software-provenance-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#what-is-software-provenance-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">What is software provenance?</a></h2> <p><a href="https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/provenance">Software provenance</a> is about providing verifiable information and integrity guarantees about a software artifact, describing where, when, and how it was produced. It is one part of the overall software software-chain that goes into creating secure software that can be <em>proven</em> to have not been tampered with.</p> <p><a href="https://slsa.dev/">Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)</a> is a security framework that systematically looks at the various points your software could be compromised, and provides suggested guidelines, controls, and checks, for mitigating these threats.</p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/content/images/2025/supply-chain-threats.svg"> </picture><figcaption>Threats to the software supply chain. From <a href="https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/threats-overview">SLSA</a></figcaption></figure> <p>Enabling provenance for your artifacts helps protect you and your customers from several of these attacks. A <a href="https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/provenance">provenance <em>attestation</em></a> provides a common format for describing how your artifact was built, the environment it was built in, the build definition that produced it, the build <em>run</em> that produced it, and more.</p> <p>The attestation is typically a JSON document, which is signed and stored "publicly" (or internally for internal software). When someone consumes the artifact, they can check the artifact's attestation, which provides all the details as to where the artifact was created.</p> <p>By itself, providing provenance and attestations doesn't <em>automatically</em> enhance the security; for that you must <em>verify</em> the attestations of software you consume or which you deploy. For example, if you're deploying to Kubernetes you could <a href="https://www.legitsecurity.com/blog/slsa-provenance-blog-series-part-2-deeper-dive-into-slsa-provenance">create a policy</a> that enforces that all Docker images deployed to the cluster have attestations. As GitHub say in their announcement post:</p> <blockquote> <p>“It's important to note that provenance by itself doesn’t make your artifact or your build process secure. What it does do is create a tamper-proof guarantee that the thing you’re executing is definitely the thing that you built, which can stop many attack vectors. It's still vital to maintain strong application security processes like requiring code review for all patches, and applying dependency updates in a timely manner.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Now that we know why we need provenance, and what attestations are useful for in general, we'll move on to see how they're generated in a specific scenario, in GitHub Actions.</p> <h2 id="how-does-github-generate-attestations-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#how-does-github-generate-attestations-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">How does GitHub generate attestations?</a></h2> <p>In May 2024, Github <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/introducing-artifact-attestations-now-in-public-beta/">introduced a public beta</a> of artifact attestations, and they became generally available in June 2024. The GitHub model is designed to be simple to use and avoid long-lived credentials. Their model uses a GitHub managed workflow and client to handle the complexity.</p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/content/images/2025/github_attestations.webp"> </picture><figcaption>The Github attestation method. From <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/introducing-artifact-attestations-now-in-public-beta/">Introducing Artifact Attestations–now in public beta</a></figcaption></figure> <p>The process starts when you execute GitHub's <code>actions/attest-build-provenance</code> action. This invokes GitHub's Sigstore client, which requests <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#understanding-the-oidc-token">the GitHub Actions OIDC token</a>, which is unique for each job. The Sigstore client then creates a public-private key-pair, and sends the <em>public</em> part of the pair to the <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio">Fulcio</a> certificate authority, along with the OIDC token.</p> <p>On receiving the OIDC token and the public part of the key pair, Flucio creates a new short-lived X.509 certificate, associated with the OIDC token, and returns it back to the Sigstore client. The Sigstore client then:</p> <ul><li>Calculates the SHA-256 digest of the artifact for which provenance is being attested.</li> <li>Writes the provenance statement as an <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/introducing-artifact-attestations-now-in-public-beta/">in-toto</a> JSON blob, including additional data (termed <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/introducing-artifact-attestations-now-in-public-beta/">a <em>predicate</em></a>) from the OIDC token.</li> <li>The provenance statement is <a href="https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/dsse">signed</a> using the <em>private</em> part of the key value pair.</li> <li>The private part of the key value pair is now thrown away, and can not be recovered.</li> <li>The statement is counter-signed by a Time Stamp Authority (TSA) that proves the signing process completed in the required 10-minutes (the Fulcio certificate's validity)</li> <li>All the data is pushed as <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/protobuf-specs/blob/main/protos/sigstore_bundle.proto">a Sigstore bundle</a>, persisted to GitHub’s attestation store and to the Sigstore Public Good Instance (for public repos)</li></ul> <p>And with that, the attestation is complete. In the next section, I'll show how you can easily create attestations for your own projects.</p> <h2 id="create-an-attestation-for-a-nuget-package-in-github-actions" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#create-an-attestation-for-a-nuget-package-in-github-actions" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Create an attestation for a NuGet package in GitHub Actions</a></h2> <p>In this section I show how to create an attestation for a NuGet package created in a GitHub action. To provide some context, this is the (simplified) workflow that we start from.

The job summary includes a link to the <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders/attestations/5148236">public GitHub attestation</a> where you can view and download the attestation directly if you wish:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/attest.png" alt="The public attestation"></p> <p>Note that the method above achieves SLSA v1.0 Build Level 2. After verifying the provenance of an artifact you still need to follow the links and evaluate the build instructions used to create the artifact.</p> <p>The next level up, SLSA v1.0 Build Level 3, requires defining the build instructions <em>outside</em> of your repository, in a reusable workflow that is shared across all your organisation's repositories, for example.

There are several ways to do this, for example you can <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations/verifying-attestations-offline">follow these instructions</a> to do offline verification.</p> <p>The easiest way to verify the attestation is to use the GitHub CLI using a command like the following:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">gh attestation verify <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>path/to/artifact/to/verify<span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-R</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>org/repo<span class="token operator">&gt;</span>
</code></pre> <p>So for example, to verify an attestation for the repo <code>andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</code>, you might use a command like the following, which provides the following output:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> gh attestation verify <span class="token parameter variable">--repo</span> andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders <span class="token string">"./NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.1.0.0-preview.3.nupkg"</span>

My gut feeling is that it's simply not feasible right now. There's <a href="https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13581">an issue on the NuGet repo</a> which seems to be suggesting providing support for this sort of thing, but there doesn't look to be any progress, so I wouldn't hold your breath. In the meantime, if it's the sort of thing you really care about, you're likely stuck with manual verification approaches.</p> <p>But that's where things <em>really</em> fall apart.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the NuGet package you upload using <code>dotnet nuget push</code> is <em>not</em> the same package as the one that you download from <a href="http://nuget.org">http://nuget.org</a>. NuGet modify the package when they receive it (to add a signature file, ironically), so the package available on nuget.org has a different SHA value to the artifact created in GitHub. That means the attestation generated for the build is effectively useless, as it does not apply to the package that you actually download from NuGet!</p> <blockquote> <p>I was <em>really</em> hoping I was wrong about that and I had messed something up, but it seems to be by design based on <a href="https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/10026">this issue</a>, and from empiricial testing. For example, <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders/actions/runs/13797726705">this is the GitHub workflow</a> in which I created and uploaded version <code>1.0.0-preview.4</code> of <em>NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</em> to NuGet. And yet, if you compare <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders/actions/runs/13797726705/artifacts/2733179426">the packages</a> stored in that artifact run with the packages you can <a href="https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders/1.0.0-preview.4">download from NuGet</a> then their clearly different files.</p> </blockquote> <p>Given all that, it really seems like you can only treat the GitHub attestations as an academic exercise for NuGet packages for now. The signature file that nuget.org embeds in the NuGet package attempts to perform a similar role, and is explicitly supported by NuGet clients, so that's probably not a big deal.</p> <blockquote> <p>It seems to me (definitely <em>not</em> a security expert) that there's an additional potential avenue for attack with the signature file. If you could perform an attacker-in-the-middle attack on the upload to nuget.org, then you could replace the contents of the package with malicious content, and nuget.org would happily sign it I believe. This is obviously a niche, mitigated issue, given HTTPS <em>and</em> Microsoft's security scanning, but seems <em>possible</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall, the conclusion to this journey was disappointing. I think it <em>might</em> be feasible to perform an attestation of the <em>content</em> of the NuGet package prior to upload, <a href="https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/10026#issuecomment-2176881037">as described in this comment</a>, as that is unaffected by the nuget.org signing process. But retrieving that "content hash" from a NuGet package isn't necessarily <a href="https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/a79a26abfe103fa7d75eba8c714a900c3a5bbc43/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Packaging/Signing/Archive/SignedPackageArchiveUtility.cs#L591">simple for clients to do</a>, which makes <em>verifying</em> any attestations similarly difficult. For now, I'm just going to declare that provenance attestations are basically not possible for NuGet packages 😢.</p> <h2 id="update-the-redemption-arc" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#update-the-redemption-arc" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Update: the redemption arc</a></h2> <p>After a bit of experimentation, and after reading through <a href="https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/10026">this issue</a> in more detail, I established that you <em>can</em> essentially "revert" the modification nuget.org makes using the Linux <code>zip</code> utility, something like this:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># Delete the .signature.p7s file that nuget.org adds to the package</span>

I show how to install the AspNetCoreModule for running ASP.NET Core in IIS, how to use APPCMD and the PowerShell snippets to create app pools and websites, and how to use <em>ServiceMonitor.exe</em> to watch an app pool. Finally, I describe how I resolved a couple of issues I ran into running an ASP.NET Core app in IIS in a container.</p> <h2 id="running-apps-in-containers" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#running-apps-in-containers" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Running apps in containers</a></h2> <p>I'm a big fan of using containers to build and package applications. You can use containers to somewhat declaratively define your application's dependencies, and how to build it, and then when you run your application you know you will get the same behaviour wherever you run it. As long as the host has docker (or a comparable container runtime) then you can build and run your application.</p> <blockquote> <p>Pretty much, anyway. Once you have built your application it's set in stone, but you're still vulnerable when you <em>build</em> your image to things like <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/">download links disappearing</a> and dependencies no longer being available. But at least those dependencies are generally <em>explicit</em> in your dockerfile.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, when people say "containers", they're normally talking about <em>Linux</em> containers. Linux containers really give the best experience for both building and running ASP.NET Core applications, but there also <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/"><em>Windows</em> containers</a>.</p> <p>Windows containers are <em>conceptually</em> similar Linux containers; they allow a similar "mini-VM" experience, in which the container is isolated from the host but the operating-system kernel is re-used. In <em>practical</em> terms though, they feel very differnt.</p> <ul><li>You can run virtually any Linux container that supports your process architecture (generally x64 or arm64) on any host. Windows, Linux, and macOS can all run Linux containers. However the base image of Windows containers must match the host. So you can only run Windows Server 2022 containers on a Windows Server 2022 machine, not a 2019 machine (for example).</li> <li>Windows images are <em>much</em> bigger than their Linux counterparts. We're talking 10-1000×—instead of a few MB for alpine you're looking at a few <em>GB</em> for a Windows Server Core image.</li> <li>Predominantly due to the sheer size, Windows containers feel a lot slower to work with than Linux containers in general.</li> <li>Some of the authoring experiences in Windows dockerfiles feels cumbersome compared to writing Linux dockerfiles.</li></ul> <p>So, given all that, why would you choose Windows containers? To my mind, the main answer is generally "because you have to". Windows containers still have the advantage of defining an isolated environment compared to running on a host directly. And in some cases you <em>need</em> to run on Windows.</p> <p>Maybe you have an app that explicitly relies on Windows-only APIs to run. Perhaps you're deploying an ASP.NET (non-core) app and need to run it in IIS. Or maybe you <em>are</em> running an ASP.NET Core app, but you need to run it on Windows, or even inside IIS.</p> <h2 id="running-an-asp-net-core-application-inside-iis-in-windows-containers" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#running-an-asp-net-core-application-inside-iis-in-windows-containers" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Running an ASP.NET Core application, inside IIS, in windows containers</a></h2> <p>In this section, I describe a dockerfile that builds an ASP.NET Core application, and then hosts it in a windows dockerfile, running in-process in IIS.

</code></pre> <p>The first interesting point in the above file is that we need to download and install the ASP.NET Core hosting bundle. This includes the ASP.NET Core runtime, but also the ASP.NET Core Module (ANCM) for IIS. The ANCM module provides integration between IIS and an ASP.NET Core app and is required to run ASP.NET Core apps in IIS.</p> <p>The second interesting point is using the IIS Administration tools to manage websites and app pools. The example above uses two different approaches (mostly for effect, not due to necessity): <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/getting-started-with-iis/getting-started-with-appcmdexe">appcmd.exe</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-10/iisadministration-powershell-cmdlets">IISAdministration PowerShell Cmdlets</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note that the PowerShell Cmdlets were introduced in IIS 10.0, which shipped with Windows Server 2016.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, you can see that we have defined an entrypoint that invokes <code>ServiceMonitor.exe</code>. This overrides the entrypoint <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/blob/main/src/aspnet/4.8/windowsservercore-ltsc2022/Dockerfile#L36">that is defined in the base <code>aspnet</code> image</a>, which similarly invokes <code>ServiceMonitor.exe</code>. <code>ServiceMonitor.exe</code> is a Windows executable designed to be used as the entrypoint process when running IIS inside a Windows Server container. It's available by default in the base images.</p> <p>As described in <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/IIS.ServiceMonitor">the project's README</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>ServiceMonitor monitors the status of the w3svc service and will exit when the service state changes from <code>SERVICE_RUNNING</code> to either one of <code>SERVICE_STOPPED</code>, <code>SERVICE_STOP_PENDING</code>, <code>SERVICE_PAUSED</code> or <code>SERVICE_PAUSE_PENDING</code>.</p> <p>Additionally, ServiceMonitor will promote environment variables from process environment it's own process environment block to the DefaultAppPool. We achieve this by naively copying all variables in our process environment block except for those Environment variable / value pairs present in this list below.</p> </blockquote> <p>We override the entrypoint in this case to add the <code>AspNetCorePool</code> argument, so that the entrypoint monitors our new app pool, instead of the default pool.</p> <p>We can build and run the app using something like the following:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">dotnet build <span class="token parameter variable">-t</span> aspnetcore-iis-image
dotnet run <span class="token parameter variable">-p</span> <span class="token number">5000</span>:5000 aspnetcore-iis-image
</code></pre> <p><code>ServiceMonitor.exe</code> watches the status of the <code>AspNetCorePool</code> app pool, and keeps the container running as long as that pool is running. If the pool shuts down, then the container also exits.</p> <h2 id="controlling-app-pool-startup-in-the-container" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#controlling-app-pool-startup-in-the-container" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Controlling app pool startup in the container</a></h2> <p>I was working on a "smoke" test recently that uses a similar setup to that described above. The test app in question starts a background worker that makes a request to itself, and then shuts down the application. The intention in this case is that no <em>external</em> requests are required. However, this proved somewhat problematic to implement when hosting in IIS.</p> <p>I specifically wanted the following behaviour:</p> <ul><li>When the container starts, the app pool is not yet started.</li> <li>The app pool is then started and a worker process is created.</li> <li>The ASP.NET Core application runs, sends a request to itself, and then exits.</li> <li>The container exits.</li></ul> <p>Unfortunately, I struggled to convince IIS (and <em>ServiceMonitor.exe</em>) to do what I wanted.</p> <p>The major problem I ran into is how IIS manages app pools. There are various properties that control how and when an app pool starts. There are also properties to control when a worker process is spun up to handle a request. Among these knobs are:</p> <ul><li><em>Start application pool immediately</em> (AKA <code>/autoStart</code>) <ul><li><code>Enabled</code>/<code>true</code>: IIS will automatically start the application pool.</li> <li><code>Disabled</code>/<code>false</code>: You need to automatically start the application pool.</li></ul> </li> <li><em>Worker process start mode</em> (AKA <code>/startMode</code>) <ul><li><code>AlwaysRunning</code>: If the application pool is running, immediately start up the worker process.</li> <li><code>OnDemand</code>: If the application pool is running, start the <em>w3wp.exe</em> process when there is an inbound application request.</li></ul> </li> <li><em>Preload the app pool</em>: (AKA <code>applicationDefaults.preloadEnabled</code>) <ul><li><code>True</code>: IIS simulates a user request to the default page of an application or virtual directory so that it is initialized. The application pool's <code>startMode</code> setting must be set to <code>AlwaysRunning</code>.</li> <li><code>False</code>: The app pool is initialized when the first request is received.</li></ul> </li></ul> <p>So, <em>in theory</em> I thought I could do the following</p> <ul><li>Create an app pool with <code>/autoStart="false"</code> and <code>/startMode="AlwaysRunning"</code></li> <li>Create a site with <code>applicationDefaults.preloadEnabled="true"</code></li> <li>Run <em>ServiceMonitor.exe</em> to monitor the app pool. This would serve two purposes <ul><li>Promote the ambient environment variables</li> <li>Exit when the app pool shuts down</li></ul> </li></ul> <p>Unfortunately this doesn't work as I had hoped. As far as I could tell, the ASP.NET Core app wasn't starting up and then the app pool wasn't exiting when the app exits. I'm not entirely sure what's going on here, but I subsequently discovered there's also the <code>applicationinitialization.doAppInitAfterRestart</code> element and I realised I just didn't have the patience to fight with IIS any more 😅</p> <p>In the end I opted for creating an entrypoint script that manually makes an http request to the app, explicitly stops the app pool, and then exits. It wasn't as smooth as I'm sure it <em>could</em> be, but at least it <em>worked</em>:</p> <pre class="language-dockerfile"><code class="language-dockerfile"><span class="token comment"># We override the normal service monitor entrypoint, because we want the container to shut down after the request is sent</span>

Err…OK.</p> <p>Well, it turns out you get this error if you an environment variable explicitly set in the <code>&lt;environmentVariables&gt;</code> section and then <em>also</em> set in the docker environment. <em>ServiceMonitor.exe</em> naively tries to "promote" the ambient environment variables by calling "add variable". And if there's <em>already</em> a variable in the app pool, it throws the above exception.

I describe when you might run into this scenario, why it happens (it's a bug in the runtime), and how you can avoid it. Finally I show a Roslyn Analyzer that you can use to automatically flag problematic code.</p> <h2 id="throwing-a-threadabortexception-with-thread-abort-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#throwing-a-threadabortexception-with-thread-abort-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Throwing a <code>ThreadAbortException</code> with <code>Thread.Abort()</code></a></h2> <p>When you're doing parallel/concurrent programming in .NET, and you want to do two things at once, you typically use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl">Task Parallel Library</a>, <code>Task</code>, <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>, and all that modern goodness. However, you <em>can</em> also <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/threading/using-threads-and-threading">manage threads yourself "manually"</a>, by calling <code>Thread.Start()</code> etc.</p> <blockquote> <p>These days, in practice, you should almost never be working directly with threads. Use <code>Task</code> <em>et al</em> wherever possible so that you're using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.threadpool">ThreadPool</a> to schedule jobs and <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> to handle continuations.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you have a running thread, and you want to stop it running, you would typically try to use <em>cooperative cancellation</em>, using <code>CancellationToken</code>s or something similar. However, in some cases that's not possible; maybe the thread is running third party code out of your control, for example. In .NET Framework you have a "kill it with fire" option: <code>Thread.Abort()</code>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note that <code>Thread.Abort()</code> <em>only</em> applies to .NET Framework. The <code>Abort()</code> method is not supported on .NET Core and throws a <code>PlatformNotSupportedException</code> to the caller instead.</p> </blockquote> <p>Calling <code>Abort()</code> on a thread causes the runtime to throw a <code>ThreadAbortException</code> in the thread's code. <code>ThreadAbortException</code> is special, in that you <em>can</em> catch it in application code (unlike some other exceptions <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.stackoverflowexception">such as <code>StackOverflowException</code></a> which can't be caught), but the runtime automatically re-throws the <code>ThreadAbortException</code> at the end of the catch block.</p> <blockquote> <p>It is possible to "cancel" the exception by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.thread.resetabort?view=netframework-4.8.1">calling <code>ResetAbort()</code></a> but I'm not going to go into that in this post.</p> </blockquote> <p>Just to give a concrete example, the following is a small .NET Framework program that starts a <code>Thread</code>, which starts doing some work, and then calls <code>Abort()</code>.</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token comment">// Start a new thread, which runs the DoWork method</span>

</code></pre> <p>This is clearly Not Good™, and ultimately comes down to <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/9633">a bug in the JIT</a>. The explanation of the bug is somewhat complex (and is largely due to a workardound for a <em>different</em> bug) but <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/9633#issuecomment-366132297">this comment</a> has all the gory details if you want to dig in.</p> <blockquote> <p>The bug is present in <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet/blob/main/Documentation/testing-with-ryujit.md">the RyuJIT compiler</a>, but <em>not</em> in the legacy JIT, so you can also workaround the bug by setting <code>&lt;useLegacyJit enabled="1" /&gt;</code> in your <em>app.config</em> or <em>web.config</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>The bug is triggered specifically when you have a "tight" loop with a <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code> directly inside a <code>while</code> loop:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">while</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

</code></pre> <p>Adding a <code>Console.WriteLine()</code> (for example) inside the <code>while</code> loop but <em>outside</em> the <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code> causes the bug to be avoided, as does using a <code>for</code> loop for example, so it's this <em>specific</em> pattern you need to watch out for. Adding a <code>finally</code> block also fixes the issue.</p> <p>Ultimately, Microsoft was decided <em>not</em> to fix this bug, so the workaround is to ensure you always "manually" re-<code>throw</code> a <code>ThreadAbortException</code> if you find yourself with the problematic pattern.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it's not <em>obvious</em> that the pattern is problematic just by looking at it, so it's a great candidate for a Roslyn Analyzer to do the spotting for you.</p> <h2 id="creating-an-analyzer-to-detect-the-pattern" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#creating-an-analyzer-to-detect-the-pattern" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Creating an analyzer to detect the pattern</a></h2> <p>In this section I show <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet/pull/1325">the Roslyn Analyzer I wrote</a> to make sure we don't accidentally introduce this code into the Datadog library.</p> <blockquote> <p>If you're building a .NET Core-only application then you don't need to worry about this, because .NET Core doesn't support <code>ThreadAbortException</code>s.

</code></pre> <p>Now when the analyzer flags an issue, you get a suggestion of how to fix it with one click:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/thread_abort_analyzer_02.png" alt="The code fix suggestion in action"></p> <p>This is clearly a crude fix (as I describe in the next section) but I've not found it to be a big issue in practice, the important thing is that it draws attention to the issue and shows a <em>possible</em> fix.</p> <h3 id="limitations-of-the-analyzer-and-the-code-fix" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#limitations-of-the-analyzer-and-the-code-fix" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Limitations of the analyzer and the code fix</a></h3> <p>The analyzer I show in this post is not particularly sophisticated. It does only very basic analysis of the <code>while</code> and <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code> statements. The limitations include:</p> <ul><li><strong>Assumes an infinite <code>while</code> loop</strong>. For simplicity, the analyzer doesn't check the expression in the while loop, and assumes it will loop infinitely. That's a conservative approach, and will flag some cases that <em>won't</em> trigger the bug, but it's good enough for our purposes.</li> <li><strong>Exception filters are not considered</strong>. For simplicity, I've ignored exception filters on the catch block. That means we might assume an exception is caught when it is not, and in that case we might <em>also</em> incorrectly assume an exception is rethrown when it is not.</li> <li><strong>Doesn't consider finally blocks</strong>. In practice, the presence of a <code>finally</code> block can avoid the bug, so doesn't need to explicitly rethrow. The analyzer does not consider this, and take a more conservative approach, requiring the rethrow.</li> <li><strong>Doesn't check flow control in catch clause</strong>. In some cases, a catch clause <em>might</em> be calling <code>throw;</code>, but if it's not a direct child of the <code>catch</code> block, the analyzer will ignore it. Again, this is a conservative approach.</li></ul> <p>In terms of the code fix provider, it's potentially unlikely that you would <em>actually</em> want to call <code>throw;</code> inside a <code>catch(Exception)</code> block. A better approach would likely be to introduce an additional <code>catch</code> clause for <code>ThreadAbortException</code> specifically, and only re-throwing in that clause.</p> <p>For example, if you have this:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">while</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token punctuation">{</span>

</code></pre> <p>This avoids the bug by re-throwing when you have a <code>ThreadAbortException</code> specifically, and means you don't rethrow for just <em>any</em> <code>Exception</code>. In practice, I wasn't going to bother writing a code fix provider at all, so I went for the simplest solution at the time. If I wanted to be more robust I would almost certainly try to use this pattern instead.</p> <h2 id="summary" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#summary" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Summary</a></h2> <p>In this post I described a bug in the .NET Framework runtime that can cause a <code>ThreadAbortException</code> to get stuck in an infinite loop. The bug only occurs when you have a try-catch block tightly nested in a <code>while</code> block. Normally if you catch a <code>ThreadAbortException</code> the runtime automatically re-throws the exception after the <code>catch</code> block has executed. However the bug means that the catch block gets stuck re-executing infinitely.</p> <p>In the second half of the post I showed a Roslyn Analyzer I created that can detect the problematic pattern and includes a code fix provider that adds a <code>throw;</code> statement to break out of the infinite loop.

This is a complex topic in general, and is more than just changing the language; it also involves changing the currencies, number rules, and other culture-specific aspects.</p> <p>The functionality required to work with a given culture is encapsulated in "satellite" resource assemblies. These assemblies are named based on the parent assembly, with an added <code>.resources</code> suffix, and placed in a folder corresponding to the appropriate culture.</p> <blockquote> <p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/dependency-loading/loading-resources#when-are-satellite-assemblies-loaded">This document</a> describes the algorithm for how satellite resource assemblies are loaded in .NET Core.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can see this pattern if you look inside the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.CommandLine/2.0.0-beta4.22272.1">System.CommandLine</a> package for example. The parent assembly <em>System.CommandLine.dll</em> is in the root folder, and there are <em>System.CommandLine.resources.dll</em> in each of the "culture" folders:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/satellites_01.png" alt="The folder structure for System.CommandLine"></p> <p>When you publish a project that references <em>System.CommandLine</em>, these resource assembly folders are also copied to the output folder. This can significantly increase the final output size of the app. The resource assemblies for <em>System.CommandLine</em> for example add up to ~260KB while the <em>System.CommandLine.dll</em> file is only ~205KB. Obviously not all libraries contain satellite assemblies, but if they did, you might see your published application size doubling.</p> <h2 id="do-you-need-localized-resources-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#do-you-need-localized-resources-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Do you need localized resources?</a></h2> <p>Obviously those localization assemblies are there for a reason. They contain localized versions of error messages for example. The question is whether or not these assemblies are important to you. Localizing your applications can provide a better user experience, and may be explicitly <em>required</em> for some applications. But the process of localization can also be difficult and somewhat expensive.</p> <p>In some cases, particularly when you're building a web app, you may know that your application will only ever run under a <em>single</em> culture, which may even be <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-globalization-cultureinfo-invariantculture">the invariant culture</a>.</p> <p>If that's the case, then you <em>know</em> that those additional culture dlls will never be used, but they'll still be copied to the publish output, and increase the overall size of your published application. It would be nice to be able to exclude these dlls.</p> <h2 id="using-globalization-invariant-mode" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#using-globalization-invariant-mode" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Using globalization invariant mode</a></h2> <p>I initially thought I might be able to exclude these satellite assemblies by explicitly enabling <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/design/features/globalization-invariant-mode.md">globalization invariant mode</a>. Globalization invariant mode is an opt-in feature in .NET Core that ensures that all culture behave like the invariant culture. This removes the typical dependencies and inconsistencies introduced across different operating systems. It's worth reading <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/design/features/globalization-invariant-mode.md">the docs</a> before enabling this mode to understand all the differences it introduces.</p> <p>There are several ways to enable globalization invariant mode, including setting an MSBuild property, either in your project or at the command line when you publish your app. I added the switch to my project as follows:</p> <pre class="language-xml"><code class="language-xml"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>Project</span> <span class="token attr-name">Sdk</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>Microsoft.NET.Sdk<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

You then publish and deploy the web project, and you don't want to deploy all the satellite assemblies.</p> <p>You might think that you need to add <code>&lt;SatelliteResourceLanguages&gt;</code> to the ASP.NET Core project, but you actually need to add it to the <em>library</em> project, as that's the project that references the <em>System.CommandLine</em> package.</p> <p>This requirements means that you need to keep a close on which packages have satellite assemblies, and which projects are referencing these projects. Alternatively, you can add the <code>&lt;SatelliteResourceLanguages&gt;</code> element to <em>all</em> projects to be on the safe side. One obvious way to do that is using a <em>Directory.Build.props</em>.</p> <pre class="language-xml"><code class="language-xml"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>Project</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

</code></pre> <p>The other thing to be aware of is that you must specify the culture exactly. <code>en</code> will ensure there's no satellite assemblies, but otherwise you need to specify the culture the same as the folder in the build output. To use the <em>System.CommandLine</em> example again, you could use <code>es</code>, <code>de</code>, or <code>pt-BR</code>, for example, but you can't use <code>pt</code> or <code>zh</code>, as they don't appear exactly in this form:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/satellites_01.png" alt="The folder structure for System.CommandLine"></p> <p>If you specify a culture that isn't in the output, no error is generated, but no satellite assemblies will be copied.</p> <p>That's about all there is to it.

It turns out there's <em>lots</em> of different ways to do that. In this post, I describe some of the many ways to do that, both from the Windows and IIS UI and from the command line. For each approach I describe the caveats, advantages, and disadvantages.</p> <h2 id="how-does-iis-work-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#how-does-iis-work-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">How does IIS work?</a></h2> <p>IIS is a huge beast, with decades of legacy, but to understand how to control setting environment variables for an application, it helps to have a basic understanding of how IIS works under the hood. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/introduction-to-iis/introduction-to-iis-architecture">This introduction to IIS on Microsoft Learn</a> provides a good overview, including the interaction between the main components involved.</p> <p>If we consider how an HTTP request coming from a client reaches an ASP.NET application running in IIS, there are a variety of components to consider:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/introduction-to-iis/introduction-to-iis-architecture#hypertext-transfer-protocol-stack-httpsys"><em>HTTP.sys</em></a> runs as part of Windows. It's a kernel-mode driver that handles HTTP requests from the network, and forwards them to a worker process.</li> <li><em>Windows Process Activation Service (WAS)</em> is responsible for managing and configuration application pool configuration and worker processes.</li> <li><em>World Wide Web Publishing Service (W3SVC)</em> acts as an adapter between WAS and HTTP.sys. It is responsible for updating HTTP.sys when app pool configuration changes, and for notifying WAS when a new request is created. WAS and W3SVC run inside the same process, svchost.exe.</li> <li><em>Application pools</em> are responsible for starting worker processes for handling requests. Multiple sites can be mapped to the same application pool.</li> <li><em>Worker processes</em> are responsible for running the managed and native modules required to handle a request. As the name suggests, worker processes are separated from each other by a process boundary, running in a process called w3wp.exe. However each pool can (optionally) host <em>multiple</em> distinct sites or applications inside the same process. Additionally, a single application pool may optionally contain multiple worker process (termed a <a href="https://www.scholarhat.com/tutorial/tools/web-garden-and-web-farm">web garden</a>).</li></ul> <p>The following diagram shows how the components interact in IIS, when an HTTP request is received from a client.</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/iis.svg" alt="How IIS processes an HTTP request"></p> <p>As shown in the diagram, the general flow is as follows:</p> <ol><li>A client sends a request. HTTP.sys intercepts it from the network</li> <li>HTTP.sys contacts W3SVC/WAS to retrieve configuration details for the request.</li> <li>WAS retrieves configuration information for the request, based on global configuration sources the applicationHost.config, and web.config for individual sites.</li> <li>WAS passes the app pool and site configuration to W3SVC which reconfigures HTTP.sys with the config.</li> <li>WAS starts a worker process to handle the incoming request, if one does not already exist.</li> <li>Once the worker process is running, HTTP.sys passes the request details to the worker process, which generates a response and returns it to HTTP.sys.</li> <li>HTTP.sys forwards the request to the client.</li></ol> <p>On subsequent requests, if a worker process already exists, HTTP.sys can forward the request directly to the process. If configuration changes subsequently, WAS creates a new worker process, and W2SVC updates HTTP.sys's configuration.</p> <p>Now we understand the overall process, we can consider how to configure our worker processes.</p> <h2 id="changing-the-environment-variables-for-a-worker-process" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#changing-the-environment-variables-for-a-worker-process" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Changing the environment variables for a worker process</a></h2> <p>As a reminder, the goal is to change the environment variables for the worker processes, <em>w3wp.exe</em>, which handle our requests. There are a variety of possible ways to do that which I'm going to run through in this post:</p> <ul><li>Set system environment variables</li> <li>Set the environment variables for the W3SVC/WAS service.</li> <li>Set environment variables at the application pool level in applicationHost.config</li></ul> <blockquote> <p>This isn't an exhaustive list. It's also possible to set environment variables for an individual application, and separately for ASP.NET Core applications. In this post I'm looking at how to set variables somewhat "globally".</p> </blockquote> <p>We'll start by looking at how to set system environment variables.</p> <h2 id="setting-system-environment-variables" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#setting-system-environment-variables" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Setting system environment variables</a></h2> <p>The "system" environment variables apply to <em>all</em> processes that run on your machine. Typically when you're setting variables using PowerShell you might you syntax something like the following:</p> <pre class="language-powershell"><code class="language-powershell"><span class="token variable">$env</span>:MY_SPECIAL_KEY = <span class="token string">"Some value"</span>
</code></pre> <p>However, that only sets the variable for the current session, rather than setting it globally. It's actually easiest to use the <code>System.Environment</code> .NET type to set the environment variable at the system level:</p> <pre class="language-powershell"><code class="language-powershell"><span class="token namespace">[System.Environment]</span>::SetEnvironmentVariable<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"MY_SPECIAL_KEY"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"Some value"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token namespace">[System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]</span>::Machine<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre> <p>After setting the variable, we need to stop the WAS and W3SVC services so that they pick up the environment changes. The easiest way to do this is to run the following from an elevated command/PowerShell prompt:</p> <pre class="language-powershell"><code class="language-powershell"><span class="token comment"># Stop the WAS service. This automatically stops the W3SVC service too.</span>
net stop <span class="token operator">/</span>y was
<span class="token comment"># Restart the services, so they pick up the new variables</span>
net <span class="token function">start</span> w3svc
</code></pre> <p>This is arguably one of the easiest ways to set environment variables for the worker processes, but it's also the most crude. <em>Any</em> process running on the system will retrieve the environment variables, which might not be something you want to do.</p> <blockquote> <p>An easy of example of where you might <em>not</em> want to do this is if you're setting the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/profiling-overview#the-profiling-api">.NET profiling API</a> environment variables: setting these at the system level would mean <em>every</em> .NET process on your Windows machine would be processed, which is practically certain to have a significant stability impact.</p> </blockquote> <p>Let's assume we don't want to set the variables at the system level. The next best thing is to set them for the IIS services instead.</p> <h2 id="setting-environment-variables-for-w3svc-and-was" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#setting-environment-variables-for-w3svc-and-was" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Setting environment variables for W3SVC and WAS</a></h2> <p>W3SVC and WAS run as Windows services, inside an instance of svchost.exe. It's possible to scope environment variables specifically to these services, but to do so, you need to edit the registry.</p> <p>You can add environment variables for a service by editing the <code>HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\&lt;SERVICE NAME&gt;</code> registry key. For example, to add an environment variable to a service called <code>SomeService</code>, you can use something like this:</p> <pre class="language-powershell"><code class="language-powershell"><span class="token function">Set-ItemProperty</span> HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\&lt;SERVICE NAME&gt; <span class="token operator">-</span>Name Environment <span class="token operator">-</span>Value <span class="token string">'MY_SPECIAL_KEY=Something'</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token function">Type</span> MultiString
</code></pre> <blockquote> <p>Note that the above example <em>changes</em> the environment variables to the value you provide, it doesn't <em>append</em> to it. If you want to include multiple variables separate the values with a line break, e.g. <code>VAL1=1`r`nVAL2=2</code>.</p> </blockquote> <p>To update the W3SVC and WAS services to ensure they have our environment variables, we can use the following:</p> <pre class="language-powershell"><code class="language-powershell"><span class="token function">Set-ItemProperty</span> HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC <span class="token operator">-</span>Name Environment <span class="token operator">-</span>Value <span class="token string">'MY_SPECIAL_KEY=Something'</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token function">Type</span> MultiString
<span class="token function">Set-ItemProperty</span> HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WAS <span class="token operator">-</span>Name Environment <span class="token operator">-</span>Value <span class="token string">'MY_SPECIAL_KEY=Something'</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token function">Type</span> MultiString
</code></pre> <p>You can also do this via the Registry Editor UI. Add a new multi-string value to the key called <code>Environment</code>, and add a line in the <code>KEY=VALUE</code> format for each variable</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/iis_2.png" alt="Updating the environment variables for the WAS service using the registry editor "></p> <p>Just as when we set the system variables, this doesn't change the variables for the already-running services, so we need to stop and start them again, to ensure they pick up the values from the registry:</p> <pre class="language-powershell"><code class="language-powershell">net stop <span class="token operator">/</span>y was
net <span class="token function">start</span> w3svc
</code></pre> <p>The environment variables you set on the W3SVC and WAS services are inherited by the worker processes that WAS starts, so each w3wp.exe process will have the <code>MY_SPECIAL_KEY</code> variable.</p> <p>This is better than before, in that we've limited the scope of our variable.

</code></pre> <p>This configuration defines two application pools using the <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> element:</p> <ul><li><code>DefaultAppPool</code></li> <li><code>dotnet7</code></li></ul> <p>There's also an <code>&lt;applicationPoolDefaults&gt;</code> element which, as you might expect, defines the default behaviour for application pools. individual app pools can override the default behaviour, as you can see where the <code>dotnet7</code> pool has <code>managedRuntimeVersion=""</code> which corresponds to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/advanced#create-the-iis-site">the recommended "No Managed Code" setting</a> for .NET Core apps.</p> <p>The <code>dotnet7</code> pool in the above example already defines a custom environment variables, indicated by the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/configuration/system.applicationHost/applicationPools/add/environmentVariables/#appcmdexe">nested <code>&lt;environmentVariables&gt;</code> element</a>. This ensures the <em>w3wp.exe</em> worker process also has the environment variable <code>MY_VAL=1</code>.</p> <p>If we want to add environment variables in <em>applicationHost.config</em>, we have two main options:</p> <ul><li>Add an environment variable to the <code>&lt;applicationPoolDefaults&gt;</code> element and inherit the variable in other pools.</li> <li>Add an environment variable to a specific pool, just as the <code>dotnet7</code> pool has. This <em>overrides</em> any values set in <code>&lt;applicationPoolDefaults&gt;</code>; they're <em>not</em> merged at runtime.</li></ul> <p>If we assume that we want to add the environment variable to <em>all</em> worker processes, then we may need to take <em>both</em> approaches. Adding the variable to <code>&lt;applicationPoolDefaults&gt;</code> ensures that all variables <em>without</em> additional configuration will have the environment variable. It also ensures any <em>new</em> pools created will also have the environment variable by default.</p> <p>However, if a pool separately defines its <code>&lt;environmentVariables&gt;</code>, as is the case for the <code>dotnet7</code> pool above, then we must <em>also</em> add the environment variable explicitly to this pool, as it <em>won't</em> inherit the values provided in <code>&lt;applicationPoolDefaults&gt;</code>.</p> <p>There are multiple ways we could modify the <em>applicationHost.config</em> to match our requirements. If you're feeling <em>really</em> brave, you could directly edit the <em>applicationHost.config</em> file found at <em>C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\config\applicationHost.config</em>, but I don't recommend it 😅 Instead I'll show how to make the changes using the IIS UI and using the <code>appcmd.exe</code> tool that comes with IIS.</p> <blockquote> <p>I recently discovered there's also an open source REST API implementation for managing IIS available here: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/IIS.Administration/">https://github.com/microsoft/IIS.Administration/</a> but I haven't tried using it yet!</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="using-the-iis-ui" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#using-the-iis-ui" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Using the IIS UI</a></h3> <p>The IIS UI is really… something.

</code></pre> <p><code>disallowRotationOnConfigChange</code> defaults to <code>false</code>. This means that when when the configuration of an application pool changes, the W3SVC service causes the worker process with the old configuration to be shut down. A new worker process, which uses the new configuration, is created in its place.</p> <p>If you set <code>disallowRotationOnConfigChange</code> to <code>true</code>, this rotation no longer happens. The worker process with the old configuration keeps running and handling requests. The next time the app pool is recycled for some reason, the worker process will naturally pick up the new configuration.</p> <p>Interestingly, changing the value of this property <em>doesn't</em> trigger a configuration change itself, whether you're setting the value to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. This provides a mechanism for <em>temporarily</em> disabling the recycling, for a specific configuration change, by temporarily enabling recycling. For example, we could add our variables while also <em>not</em> forcing recycling, using something like the following:</p> <pre class="language-powershell"><code class="language-powershell">C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\appcmd<span class="token punctuation">.</span>exe <span class="token function">set</span> config <span class="token operator">-</span>section:system<span class="token punctuation">.</span>applicationHost/applicationPools

  <span class="token operator">/</span>commit:apphost<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre> <p>This applies the configuration without restarting the app pool. We can then restore the original behaviour subsequently by setting the property to <code>false</code>:</p> <pre class="language-powershell"><code class="language-powershell">C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\appcmd<span class="token punctuation">.</span>exe <span class="token function">set</span> config <span class="token operator">-</span>section:system<span class="token punctuation">.</span>applicationHost/applicationPools

I'll start by demonstrating how a cross-site scripting attack works, focusing on client-side, DOM-based attacks using dangerous APIs.</p> <p>After demonstrating the issue, I'll show how you can use Trusted Types to close the vulnerabilities in these APIs, and how Trusted Types work. After closing these vulnerabilities, I'll show several ways to work Trusted Types: by using safe APIs, by using sanitisation libraries, and by creating Trusted Types using policies.</p> <blockquote> <p>It's worth noting that the Trusted Types API is currently only available in Chromium based browsers, but it has been available in Chromium since version 83, released in 2020.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="dom-based-client-side-cross-site-scripting" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#dom-based-client-side-cross-site-scripting" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">DOM-based client-side cross-site-scripting</a></h2> <p>Cross-site-scripting generally occurs where you allow input from a user to be directly written, unsanitised, into an HTML page in some way. This can occur in server side apps when generating HTML, for example if you use the <code>@Html.Raw()</code> method in Razor.</p> <p>A similar vulnerability exists on the client-side if you allow user data to be written unsanitised into the DOM. This input could come from a URL parameter or <code>postMessage</code> channel for example, and it becomes problematic if you use it directly in some APIs like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML"><code>Element.innerHTML</code></a>, <code>eval</code>, or <code>setTimeout</code>, for example.</p> <p>To demonstrate the issue, The following shows part of a very simple HTML page returned from an ASP.NET Core app. It contains a single "target" <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element which initially contains some text to be replaced. There is also a simple <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> block which reads a <code>username</code> parameter from the URL's querystring, and writes the name as an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag using the <code>innerHTML</code> property.</p> <blockquote> <p>Remember, this code contains an XSS vulnerability, it's just for demo purposes!</p> </blockquote> <pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">id</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>target<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>To be replaced<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

CSP is typically added as a header, but it can also be added as a <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element. CSP provides a whole swathe of features, such as forcing requests to use <code>https</code> instead of <code>http</code>, only allowing connections to specific hosts and resources, only allowing scripts that match a specific hash, and a variety of other options.</p> <p>The feature I'm using in this post is based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/trusted-types/">a draft W3C specification called Trusted Types</a>. In particular, you can add the <code>require-trusted-types-for</code> directive to your CSP.</p> <p>My security headers library, <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders"><em>NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</em></a> can help you build a CSP and add it as a header to your ASP.NET Core responses.

The attack has been thwarted!</p> <p>So <em>how</em> does the CSP header protect you?</p> <p>As you can see from the log messages, when you return a CSP with the <code>require-trusted-types-for 'Script'</code> directive, you put the browser into a different mode, in which the standard APIs no longer accept simple <code>string</code> values. Instead, APIs like <code>innerHTML</code> must be passed a <code>TrustedHTML</code> object; APIs like <code>eval</code> must be used with a <code>TrustedScript</code> object; and APIs like setting a <code>&lt;script src&gt;</code> must be used with <code>TrustedScriptURL</code>.</p> <h2 id="fixing-trusted-type-violations" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#fixing-trusted-type-violations" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Fixing trusted type violations</a></h2> <p>By changing the type accepted by these APIs (also called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API#injection_sinks">"injection sinks"</a>), you're safe from simple injection attacks, but presumably you <em>do</em> want to call those APIs, or at least achieve the same functionality.

In this post I show how I applied this to my <em>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</em> source generator, so that I could support features only available in the .NET 8/9 SDK, while still supporting users stuck on the .NET 7 SDK.</p> <h2 id="-net-sdk-versions-microsoft-codeanalysis-csharp-and-nuget-package-layouts" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#-net-sdk-versions-microsoft-codeanalysis-csharp-and-nuget-package-layouts" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">.NET SDK versions, <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em>, and NuGet package layouts</a></h2> <p>In <a href="/supporting-multiple-sdk-versions-in-analyzers-and-source-generators/">my previous post</a> I provided a long description of how and why you might need to target multiple versions of the .NET SDK. This post directly follows on from that one, so if you haven't, I suggest reading that one first.</p> <p>In summary, when you create a source generator, you reference a specific version of the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp">Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</a> NuGet package. The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/roslyn-version-support">version of this package</a> you choose defines the minimum version of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/versioning-sdk-msbuild-vs">Visual Studio, MSBuild, and the .NET SDK</a> that your source generator will work with. The higher the version, the more Roslyn APIs you can use, but the higher the version of the .NET SDK the consumer must be using.</p> <p>In the .NET 6 SDK, Microsoft updated the logic that finds analyzers/source generators in a NuGet file to allow versioning a source generator by Roslyn API version. That means you can ship a source generator that provides basic functionality when used with the .NET 6 SDK (for example) but which provides <em>additional</em> functionality when used with the .NET 7 or .NET 8 SDKs, for example. You do this by shipping multiple versions of the generator in the NuGet package, each compiled against a different version of <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp">Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</a>:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/system_text_json_4.png" alt="The (simplified) layout of the System.Text.Json 6.0.0 package"></p> <p>The .NET SDK then loads the highest supported version of the analyzer, based on the version of the Roslyn API that it supports.</p> <p>I covered most of the details of why you might want to multi-target multiple roslyn versions in your package in <a href="/supporting-multiple-sdk-versions-in-analyzers-and-source-generators/">the previous post</a>, so in this post I'll show how I added multi-targeting support to my <em>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</em> source generator.</p> <h2 id="adding-multi-targeting-support-for-netescapades-enumgenerators" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#adding-multi-targeting-support-for-netescapades-enumgenerators" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Adding multi-targeting support for <em>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</em></a></h2> <p>The <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetEscapades.EnumGenerators/">NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</a> package is a source generator for making working with enums faster. I <a href="/recent-updates-for-netescapades-enumgenerators-interceptors/">recently added experimental support for interceptors to the package</a>, but this required using a newer version of the Roslyn API than I was previously. The interceptor API I needed was only available in .NET SDK version <code>8.0.400</code> (version <code>4.11</code> of the Roslyn API in <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em>), whereas I was currently targeting <code>4.4</code>.</p> <p>The easy approach would have been to simply update the version of <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em> to <code>4.11.0</code> to give access to the <code>4.11</code> Roslyn API. However, doing so would have meant that anyone currently using the package with a .NET 7 SDK or a .NET 8 SDK below <code>8.0.400</code> would have been broken.</p> <p>Rather than inconvenience people, I decided to have a go at multi-targeting. This would ensure that down-version users could use the basic functionality, but the interceptor support would not be available. Meanwhile, anyone using <code>8.0.400</code> or higher of the .NET SDK <em>would</em> be able to enable the interceptor functionality. The best of both worlds!</p> <p>The approach I took to multi-targeting was heavily based on <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/59074/files#diff-258ed32f98847603de7425cdcd362915271c61390268af3e6c75b4335b817471">the approach taken by the built-in generators</a> like the <em>System.Text.Json</em> generator and the <em>Microsoft.Extensions.Logging</em> generator when they first added multi-targeting support.</p> <p>I implemented the bulk of the support in <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.EnumGenerators/pull/101">a single PR</a>, and it's broadly the same approach I show in this post.</p> <h3 id="the-original-prior-to-multi-targeting" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#the-original-prior-to-multi-targeting" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">The original: prior to multi-targeting</a></h3> <p>To set the stage, <em>prior</em> to multi-targeting, the <em>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</em> source generator targeted version <code>4.4</code> of the Roslyn API, by referencing <code>4.4.0</code> of the <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em> NuGet package. This API version corresponds to the .NET 7 SDK, and gives access to the <a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-9-avoiding-performance-pitfalls-in-incremental-generators/#1-use-the-net-7-api-forattributewithmetadataname">recommended <code>ForAttributeWithMetadataName</code> API</a>.</p> <p>The solution consisted of two main projects:</p> <ul><li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</code>: The main source generator project</li> <li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Attributes</code>: A library project containing the "marker" attributes that drive the source generator</li></ul> <p>There's also a bunch of test projects, some of the main ones are described below. I've described these approaches in <a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-2-testing-an-incremental-generator-with-snapshot-testing/">more detail</a> <a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-3-integration-testing-and-packaging/">previously</a> in <a href="/series/creating-a-source-generator/">this series</a>:</p> <ul><li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Tests</code>: Unit tests for the generator functionality, and snapshot tests comparing the generated output</li> <li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.IntegrationTests</code>: "Integration" test project that references the source generator project directly, and runs a bunch of tests. This ensures the generated output <em>actually</em> compiles, and gives the expected values when executed, for example.</li> <li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Nuget.IntegrationTests</code>: Runs the same tests as the above project, but instead of referencing the source generator directly, it uses a version of the generator that has been fully packed into a NuGet package. This is the closest to a "real life" scenario you can get to.</li></ul> <p>There are a bunch of other tests for additional variations, but I'll ignore those for brevity:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/multi_targeting_01.png" alt="The solution layout"></p> <p>Now we have the starting point, lets begin the migration to support multiple Roslyn versions.</p> <h3 id="splitting-the-source-generator-project" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#splitting-the-source-generator-project" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Splitting the source generator project</a></h3> <p>Prior to supporting the multi-targeting, the <em>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</em> <em>.csproj</em> file looked as shown below.

</code></pre> <p>To support multi-targeting, we need to make some significant changes to this project:</p> <ul><li>Split the source generator project into multiple projects, each referencing different version of <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em>. <ul><li>One project references version <code>4.4.0</code>. This is the "lower" bound for our SDK support, and corresponds to the .NET 7 SDK.</li> <li>Another project references version <code>4.11.0</code>. This is the "enhanced" SDK support, which we need for interceptor support, and corresponds to <code>8.0.4xx</code> of the .NET SDK.</li></ul> </li> <li>Update the projects to share most of the implementation. Update the implementation in the <code>4.11</code> project with the additional functionality.</li> <li>Create a separate project that is used solely to <em>pack</em> the two source generator dlls into the final NuGet package. You could also use a nuspec file for this, but I prefer to use a csproj instead.</li></ul> <p>The final result looks something like this in the solution explorer:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/multi_targeting_02.png" alt="The updated solution explorer, with 3 new projects"></p> <p>So the original <em>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</em> project has gone, and we have <em>three</em> projects in its place:</p> <ul><li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Rolsyn4_04</code>: The version of the generator that references <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em> <code>4.4.0</code>.</li> <li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Rolsyn4_11</code>: The version of the generator that references <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em> <code>4.11.0</code>.</li> <li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Pack</code>: A project focused solely on collecting the output artifacts from the other source projects and producing the final NuGet package.</li></ul> <p>Note that the three projects are peers in the solution explorer, but the files are all side-by-side in the same folder in the filesystem, rather than being in separate folders:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/multi_targeting_03.png" alt="The filesystem of the updated solution, showing the files are side-by-side"></p> <p>Now lets look at the project files, as well as some ancillary files.</p> <h3 id="exploring-the-new-project-files" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#exploring-the-new-project-files" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Exploring the new project files</a></h3> <p>We'll start by looking at the <code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Rolsyn4_04</code> and <code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Rolsyn4_11</code> <em>.csproj</em> files.

</code></pre> <p>As you can see, this <code>.targets</code> file <em>only</em> includes values for controlling how the dlls are built. There's nothing related to actually packaging the file here.

</code></pre> <p>Phew, that's a lot, but it is <em>mostly</em> just a way to define a nuspec file while reusing values between the dlls. A simple <code>dotnet pack</code> and we have everything we need!</p> <p>Of course, as we're now <em>building</em> for multiple Roslyn versions, we really should <em>test</em> for those different versions too, right?</p> <h2 id="testing-multi-targeting-support" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#testing-multi-targeting-support" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Testing multi-targeting support</a></h2> <p>Testing is where things really start to get a little hairy. Prior to the multi-targeting support I had 3 main test projects, as I described previously:</p> <ul><li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Tests</code></li> <li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.IntegrationTests</code></li> <li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Nuget.IntegrationTests</code></li></ul> <p>However, if I really wanted to be sure that everything was working as expected, I decided I would need to run the tests <em>both</em> with the <code>4.4</code> Roslyn API and with the <code>4.11</code> Roslyn API. Which means running all the tests <em>twice</em> with two different versions of the .NET SDK.</p> <p>But on top of that the <em>unit test</em> project, <code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Tests</code>, needs to reference one of the <em>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</em> projects (<code>Roslyn4_04</code> or <code>Roslyn4_11</code>) directly, which means you actually need <em>two</em> versions of this project (or at least, that's what I did).</p> <blockquote> <p>This uses a "normal" project reference, so you can reference <em>either</em> version of the projects, the version of the SDK you're using for the unit testing/snapshot testing isn't critical.</p> </blockquote> <p>For the integration tests I took a slightly different approach. These test projects reference the <em>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</em> projects as an <em>analyzer</em>. In this case we <em>can't</em> load the <code>Roslyn4_11</code> project unless we're using a supported version of the SDK, so it makes things a bit trickier. In the end, I ended up creating several new test projects:</p> <ul><li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Tests.Roslyn4_04</code>: Runs all the unit/snapshot tests for the <code>4.4</code> version of the analyzer.</li> <li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Tests.Roslyn4_11</code>: Runs all the unit/snapshot tests for the <code>4.11</code> version of the analyzer, including some additional snapshot tests for the interceptor support.</li> <li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.IntegrationTests</code>: References the <code>4.4</code> version of the generator, runs tests that are common to both implementations.</li> <li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Interceptors.IntegrationTests</code>: References <em>either</em> the <code>4.4</code> or <code>4.11</code> version of the generator, <em>depending on the currently active .NET SDK version</em>, but only runs additional interceptor tests when using the <code>4.11</code> version</li> <li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.NuGet.IntegrationTests</code>: References the final generated NuGet package, and runs tests common to both implementations.</li> <li><code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Interceptors.IntegrationTests</code>: References the final generated NuGet package, but only runs additional interceptor tests when using the <code>4.11</code> version.</li></ul> <p>If all that extra duplication sounds like a pain, you're not wrong 😅 Still, for full coverage, it's pretty much necessary. The following sections show how I handled the MSBuild/csproj mess.</p> <h3 id="splitting-the-snapshot-test-project" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#splitting-the-snapshot-test-project" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Splitting the snapshot test project</a></h3> <p>The <code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Tests</code> project is <a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-2-testing-an-incremental-generator-with-snapshot-testing/">where I do the snapshot testing</a> of the generators, and is the main feedback loop when I'm developing a source generator. As I wanted to be able to quickly test both versions of the generator, all while developing locally, I split the project in two, each referencing a different version of <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em> and of the generator project.</p> <p>As before, I reduced the duplication in the project files by moving the bulk of the definition into a <code>.targets</code> file, and referencing it from two different <em>.csproj</em> files. The <code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Tests.Roslyn4_04</code> .csproj file looks like this:</p> <pre class="language-xml"><code class="language-xml"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>Project</span> <span class="token attr-name">Sdk</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>Microsoft.NET.Sdk<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

</code></pre> <p>Both of these test projects can run on any support .NET SDK version, because the generator directly uses the <code>Compilation</code> types provided in the <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em> package, rather than relying on it being provided by the .NET SDK itself. That's different from the integration test projects, which <em>do</em> rely on the SDK.</p> <h3 id="multi-targeting-the-integration-test-project-for-multiple-net-sdk-versions" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#multi-targeting-the-integration-test-project-for-multiple-net-sdk-versions" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Multi-targeting the integration test project for multiple .NET SDK versions</a></h3> <p>The integration test projects for my source generators reference the generator projects, but add the generator with <code>OutputItemType="Analyzer"</code>, as described <a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-3-integration-testing-and-packaging/">in a previous post</a>. This lets you test your generator <em>similar</em> to how it will be used "in production", but without needing to create and reference a NuGet package locally, which is a bit of a pain.</p> <p>In integration tests, your source generator is running <em>in</em> the compiler, so you need to be careful about the Roslyn APIs. You can only reference and test functionality exposed by the <code>Roslyn4_11</code> project if you're using a high enough SDK version. To achieve the testing I wanted, I needed to conditionally reference a different project (<code>Roslyn4_04</code> or <code>Roslyn4_11</code>) <em>based on the version of the .NET SDK I was building with</em>.</p> <p>It turns out, I've never had to do that before. I've had <em>minimum</em> .NET SDK version requirements, but needing to run with two different SDK versions isn't something I'd tried before. Luckily, it turns out that MSBuild exposes the .NET SDK version you're using as a property. I used this in my test project <em>.csproj</em> to set a simple MSBuild property and a constant, which I could use further on in the <em>.csproj</em> file, and in <code>#if</code> conditions in the code.</p> <p>This post is already long, so I've just shown the pertinent parts of the <em>.csproj</em> file below:</p> <pre class="language-xml"><code class="language-xml"><span class="token comment">&lt;!-- Are we building with .NET SDK 8.0.400 or greater? --&gt;</span>

</code></pre> <p>Previously, this whole build was using the <code>8.0.402</code> .NET SDK, but with my changes I wanted to ensure I could run <em>some</em> of the tests with an earlier version of the .NET SDK. Specifically, and for simplicity, I decided to <em>only</em> run the NuGet package tests on both SDKs in CI. Consequently, I updated the build pipeline to be something like the following (again, simplified, but with the changes highlighted):</p> <pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">name</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> BuildAndPack

</code></pre> <p>I <em>could</em> have chosen to run <em>all</em> the integration tests with the earlier SDK, but it didn't seem worth the effort, as I share <a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-3-integration-testing-and-packaging/">the same actual test files between both the integration tests and package tests</a>. So with that, I'm done!</p> <h2 id="was-it-worth-it-should-you-do-it-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#was-it-worth-it-should-you-do-it-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Was it worth it? Should you do it?</a></h2> <p>As you can tell by the length of the post, there's a <em>lot</em> of moving pieces required to support multiple Roslyn API versions in a source generator. This post is actually quite brief compared to the changes I found I needed to make in my project, as I haven't touched on a bunch of additional points.</p> <blockquote> <p>A prime example of work not covered here is tracking your tests in CI. I wanted to make sure I didn't "lose" any tests with these changes, and to understand exactly what I was testing under what SDK. I used the <code>EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action@v2</code> GitHub Action for this, but tracking it properly required a bunch of gnarly <code>#if</code>/<code>#elif</code> that I didn't go into in this post, but <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.EnumGenerators/blob/main/tests/NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Interceptors.IntegrationTests/InterceptorTests.cs#L8-L28">which you can see in the repo</a> if you like pain😆</p> </blockquote> <p>So…was it worth it? Well, it depends. If you don't <em>have</em> to do this, then don't. It's a <em>lot</em> of work and added complexity to a project, without a big pay off. <em>In general</em> there aren't a lot of reasons <em>not</em> to just update your .NET SDK, so there <em>shouldn't</em> be a big call for supporting older versions of the SDK.</p> <blockquote> <p>Ironically, I have one in my day job—.NET 8 dropped support for the unsupported (but still heavily used) CentOS 7 Linux distro (and related distros), which means we <em>can't</em> upgrade the SDK for the portions of the build that need to run on CentOS 7🙁</p> </blockquote> <p>In my case, I wanted to increase the .NET SDK requirement so I could add a <em>preview</em> of an <em>optional</em> component. That didn't seem a big enough justification for forcing <em>everyone</em> to update their .NET SDK, so multi-targeting <em>somewhat</em> made sense. Honestly, I mostly took the multi-targeting approach to see how bad it would be. And the verdict is: it's Pretty Bad™😅</p> <h2 id="summary" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#summary" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Summary</a></h2> <p>In this post I showed how you could update an existing source generator project to add multi-targeting support for multiple Roslyn API versions. This ensures your source generator can run on the widest possible range of .NET SDK versions and that features which require a newer SDK version can "light up" when it's available. Unfortunately this process is somewhat complex.</p> <p>In this post I described the changes I made to the project files of my <em>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</em> source generator project when I added Roslyn API multi-targeting support. I split the main source generator API into two, to produce two different dlls targeting different versions of the <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em> package. To test the changes, I split my unit testing projects in two, each testing a different version of the source generator project, and updated the integration tests to support working with multiple versions of the .NET SDK.</p> <p>Overall multi-targeting multiple versions of the .NET SDK adds quite a lot of complexity to the various projects you need, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you definitely need to.</p> ]]></content:encoded><category><![CDATA[Source Generators;C#]]></category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Supporting multiple .NET SDK versions in analyzers and source generators]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this post I describe why source generators might need to work with multiple versions of the .NET SDK and how NuGet packages support this in .NET 6]]></description><link>https://andrewlock.net/supporting-multiple-sdk-versions-in-analyzers-and-source-generators/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://andrewlock.net/supporting-multiple-sdk-versions-in-analyzers-and-source-generators/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew Lock]]></dc:creator><media:content url="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/system_text_json_banner.png" medium="image" /><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/system_text_json_banner.png" /><p>In this post I describe why source generators might need to work with multiple versions of the .NET SDK. This may be necessary if you want to support features that are only available in newer versions of the .NET SDK, while simultaneously supporting users building with older versions of the .NET SDK in a more limited fashion. I then show how support was added in .NET 6 for this scenario, and how NuGet package layouts have changed. In the next post I show how you can add multi-targeting support to your own packages.</p> <h2 id="why-does-the-version-of-the-net-sdk-matter-for-source-generators-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#why-does-the-version-of-the-net-sdk-matter-for-source-generators-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Why does the version of the .NET SDK matter for source generators?</a></h2> <p>When you create a source generator, you reference a specific version of the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp">Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</a> NuGet package. The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/roslyn-version-support">version of the package</a> you choose defines the minimum version of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/versioning-sdk-msbuild-vs">Visual Studio, MSBuild, and the .NET SDK</a> that your source generator will work with.</p> <p>The following table is compiled (well, inferred) from the links above, primarily for recent versions of the package:</p> <table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">Roslyn package version</th><th style="text-align:center">SDK version</th><th style="text-align:center">MSBuild/Visual Studio version</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">4.12.0</td><td style="text-align:center">9.0.1xx</td><td style="text-align:center">17.12</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4.11.0</td><td style="text-align:center">8.0.4xx</td><td style="text-align:center">17.11</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4.10.0</td><td style="text-align:center">8.0.3xx</td><td style="text-align:center">17.10</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4.9.2</td><td style="text-align:center">8.0.2xx</td><td style="text-align:center">17.9</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4.8.0</td><td style="text-align:center">8.0.1xx</td><td style="text-align:center">17.8</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4.7.0</td><td style="text-align:center">7.0.4xx</td><td style="text-align:center">17.7</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4.6.0</td><td style="text-align:center">7.0.3xx</td><td style="text-align:center">17.6</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4.5.0</td><td style="text-align:center">7.0.2xx</td><td style="text-align:center">17.5</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4.4.0</td><td style="text-align:center">7.0.1xx</td><td style="text-align:center">17.4</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4.3.1</td><td style="text-align:center">6.0.4xx</td><td style="text-align:center">17.3</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4.2.0</td><td style="text-align:center">6.0.3xx</td><td style="text-align:center">17.2</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4.1.0</td><td style="text-align:center">6.0.2xx</td><td style="text-align:center">17.1</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">4.0.1</td><td style="text-align:center">6.0.1xx</td><td style="text-align:center">17.0</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">3.8.0</td><td style="text-align:center">5.0.1xx</td><td style="text-align:center">16.8</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">3.4.0</td><td style="text-align:center">3.1.1xx</td><td style="text-align:center">16.4</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">2.10.0</td><td style="text-align:center">2.1.5xx</td><td style="text-align:center">15.9</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>As you can see, each new minor release of the .NET SDK and Visual Studio version is associated with a new Roslyn package (<em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em>) version. Each new version of the package provides additional APIs for you to use.</p> <p>For example, when I first created my NetEscapades.EnumGenerators project I used version <code>4.0.1</code> of <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em>, which gave access to the new incremental generator API <code>IIncrementalGenerator</code> introduced in .NET 6.</p> <p>When I wanted to use <a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-9-avoiding-performance-pitfalls-in-incremental-generators/#1-use-the-net-7-api-forattributewithmetadataname">the recommended <code>ForAttributeWithMetadataName</code> API</a> introduced in .NET 7, I had to update the <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em> version used by the source generator to <code>4.4.0</code>. However, by updating that dependency, the source generator was no longer compatible with the .NET 6 SDK. You could still install the package, but the generator would not work, and you would get a warning at compile time:</p> <pre class="language-plain"><code class="language-plain">CSC : warning CS8032: An instance of analyzer NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.EnumGenerator

The system cannot find the file specified.
</code></pre> <p>So in general, if you want to have the broadest support, you should reference the <em>lowest</em> version of <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em> that you can. On the other hand, if you want access to the latest SDK features, you need to reference the <em>highest</em> version of the package. It's the same classic trade-off that library maintainers have to make when it comes to dependencies, and what's the right choice for you will vary.</p> <h2 id="supporting-multiple-sdk-versions-and-lighting-up-features" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#supporting-multiple-sdk-versions-and-lighting-up-features" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Supporting multiple SDK versions and lighting-up features</a></h2> <p>One traditional approach to solving the "broader support vs. features" trade-off is to kind of do both! You target the lowest version of the API you can get away with, and that serves as your lower bound. You then "light up" with additional features when you detect that a newer version of the API is available.</p> <p>A classic example of where this makes sense for a source generator is with <a href="https://andrewlock.net/recent-updates-for-netescapades-enumgenerators-interceptors/">the interceptor support I recently added</a> to the <em>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</em> source generator. The source generator requires version <code>4.4.0</code> as a minimum (.NET 7 SDK, for <code>ForAttributeWithMetadataName</code> support), but if you're using a .NET SDK version of <code>8.0.400</code> or greater, you can optionally enable the interceptor support.</p> <p>I <em>could</em> have made <code>8.0.400</code> the minimum required SDK version to get <em>any</em> functionality, but by making the interceptor support an optional extra, people stuck on older versions of the SDK can continue to use the other features of the library.</p> <p>There are also examples of needing to take this approach in the runtime itself. For example, the original System.Text.Json source generator was written to support the non-incremental version of source generators. However, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/56702">this API was notorious for causing performance problems in the IDE</a>. The only solution was to rewrite the generator to use <code>IIncrementalGenerator</code>.</p> <p>Unfortunately, simply updating the <code>JsonSourceGenerator</code> package to use a newer version of <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em> (to access the <code>IIncrementalGenerator</code> API) would have broken the generator for anyone using the (still supported at the time) .NET 5 SDK. Instead, the team created two versions of the generator—one that used the .NET 6 SDK and the <code>IIncrementalGenerator</code> API, and one that used the .NET 5 SDK and the non-incremental generator.</p> <p>Sounds easy enough, right? After all, shipping different code for multiple target frameworks in a single NuGet package has been possible in .NET for a long time. Well…not so fast. We're not talking about shipping different dlls per <em>framework</em>. We're talking about shipping different dlls per <em>.NET SDK</em>…</p> <h2 id="creating-nuget-packages-that-support-multiple-roslyn-sdk-versions" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#creating-nuget-packages-that-support-multiple-roslyn-sdk-versions" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Creating NuGet packages that support multiple Roslyn/SDK versions</a></h2> <p>The fundamental problem of needing to ship different versions of source generators (and analyzers more generally) <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/20355">was realised</a> as part of the .NET 6 preview releases, when the performance issues with the System.Text.Json generator appeared. At that point, there was essentially no solution—as a source generator author you had to choose either broad support or new APIs. And if you went for the latter, then customers using your package with old versions of the SDK would get warnings in their build.</p> <p>The solution was to update the logic in the .NET SDK that loads analyzers/source generators from NuGet packages to be "SDK version aware". This logic is available as of .NET 6.</p> <p>Prior to .NET 6, the .NET SDK only recognizes the following folder folder structure in NuGet packages for loading analyzers:</p> <pre><code>analyzers[\dotnet][\cs|vb]\my_generator.dll
</code></pre> <p>In .NET 6 this pattern is still recognized, but if you have specific Roslyn API version requirements, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/20793">you can encode those in the folder structure</a>:</p> <pre><code>analyzers[\dotnet][\roslyn{version}][\cs|vb]\my_generator.dll
</code></pre> <p>Note the additional <code>roslyn{version}</code> folder in the <code>analyzers\dotnet</code> folder. The <code>{version}</code> is a <code>{major}.{minor}</code> number corresponding to the Roslyn API version (the version of the <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em> package referenced in your source generator).</p> <p>By splitting by Roslyn API version, you can now ship multiple dlls in the same NuGet package, each of which uses a different version of the <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em> package, and hence each of which can use features available in the specific version of the .NET SDK that's available.</p> <p>We can see this in practice by taking a look at how the layout of <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Text.Json">the System.Text.Json NuGet package</a> changed between <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Text.Json/6.0.0-preview.5.21301.5">the .NET 6 preview 5 builds</a> (when the non-incremental source generator was introduced) and <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Text.Json/6.0.0">the first GA .NET 6 build</a>.</p> <p>The <code>6.0.0-preview.5.21301.5</code> version of the package uses the default "simple" layout, placing the <em>System.Text.Json.SourceGeneration.dll</em> file in the <code>analyzers/dotnet/cs</code> folder:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/system_text_json.png" alt="The layout of the 6.0.0-preview.5.21301.5 version of the System.Text.Json NuGet"></p> <p>In contrast, if we look at the <code>6.0.0</code> version of the package, you can see there are intermediate <code>roslyn3.11</code> and <code>roslyn4.0</code> folders. The <code>3.11</code> version includes a version of the generator that is compatible with the .NET 5 SDK, while the <code>4.0</code> version requires the .NET 6 SDK, and uses <code>IIncrementalGenerator</code>:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/system_text_json_2.png" alt="The layout of the 6.0.0 version of the System.Text.Json NuGet"></p> <blockquote> <p>Note that I simplified the layout in the package above to remove the localization dlls, so if you inspect the version from nuget.org, you'll also see the additional satellite resource dlls.</p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Text.Json/9.0.0">latest version of the package</a>, <code>9.0.0</code> includes a third differentiation, supporting the .NET 7 SDK (version <code>4.4</code> of the roslyn API):</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/system_text_json_3.png" alt="The layout of the 9.0.0 version of the System.Text.Json NuGet"></p> <p>There's a slight wrinkle in this otherwise-elegant solution when a NuGet package is loaded in a version of the .NET SDK that <em>doesn't</em> understand the new analyzer layout. By default, the earlier SDK would load <em>all</em> of the versions of the generator, which is obviously problematic.</p> <p>To work around that, the .NET 6 SDK introduces a new MSBuild property, <code>$(SupportsRoslynComponentVersioning)</code>. You can then include a <code>.targets</code> folder in your NuGet package that detects the <em>lack</em> of this variable to do the analyzer selection manually yourself.</p> <p>As an example, the <em>System.Text.Json</em> <code>6.0.0</code> package includes the following <code>.targets</code> file, which is added to the build of a project that references the <em>System.Text.Json</em> NuGet package. The file is a little hard to read (obviously, it's MSBuild) but it's essentially just checking for <code>$(SupportsRoslynComponentVersioning) != 'true'</code>, and removing the <code>rolsyn4.x</code> analyzers if so, leaving only the <code>roslyn3.x</code> package:</p> <pre class="language-xml"><code class="language-xml"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>Project</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

I show how you can use this to add "configuration" to your source generators so consumers can control some behaviour of the source generator. Finally I show how you can bundle a <em>.targets</em> file with your generator to make some aspects of this easier to use for consumers, particularly when it comes to interceptors.</p> <h2 id="why-might-you-want-to-access-msbuild-settings-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#why-might-you-want-to-access-msbuild-settings-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Why might you want to access MSBuild settings?</a></h2> <p>In the <a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-12-providing-and-accessing-msbuild-settings-in-source-generators/">previous post</a> I described how some features of the compilation can be accessed on the <code>Compilation</code> object. However, there's a lot you <em>can't</em> get from there. For example, the default <code>RootNamespace</code> does not appear to be accessible from <code>Compilation</code>. Instead, you must access the MSBuild property to know what it's set to.</p> <p>Most of the source generators I've created are controlled solely by attributes applied in code. However there are many cases where you might want to control the behaviour of a source generator in a <em>global</em> way. For example, if you're generating a single type, you may want to be able to control the <em>name</em> of the generated type, or you may want to enable or disable specific features.</p> <p>As a concrete example, I recently needed to do this while working on <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetEscapades.EnumGenerators"><em>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</em></a>. I wanted the interceptor support to be disabled by default, but for consumers to be able to enable it with an MSBuild flag.</p> <p>In the following sections I'll describe the basics of how to work with both of these aspects.</p> <h2 id="reading-msbuild-settings-from-a-source-generator" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#reading-msbuild-settings-from-a-source-generator" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Reading MSBuild settings from a source generator</a></h2> <p>I'll start by showing how you can read the <code>RootNamespace</code> for a project.

In this case, however, the file is exposing various properties of the MSBuild system, which can then be consumed by your source generator.</p> <p>As you can see from the above listing, only a few properties are exposed, with <code>RootNamespace</code>, <code>ProjectDir</code>, and <code>TargetFramework</code> being the most interesting. So what if you want to read some <em>other</em> MSBuild property? So that a consumer can specify "settings" for your generator, for example?</p> <h2 id="enabling-generator-access-for-an-msbuild-property" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#enabling-generator-access-for-an-msbuild-property" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Enabling generator access for an MSBuild property</a></h2> <p>You've seen how to access a given MSBuild property, but you can <em>only</em> access properties that are exposed in the generated editor config.

Overall this is a relatively simple feature: we create a file with the right name, pack it into a NuGet package, and any project consuming our NuGet package automatically gets the <code>.props</code> file added to it.</p> <blockquote> <p>You can read more about this NuGet feature <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/concepts/msbuild-props-and-targets">in the documentation</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>In order to keep things more concrete, I'm going to switch to describing how things work in my <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.EnumGenerators">NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</a> package, instead of the hypothetical generators I've described so far.</p> <p>First of all, we create a file called <code>&lt;Package&gt;.props</code>, i.e. <code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.props</code>. In here we add the <code>&lt;CompilerVisibleProperty&gt;</code> definition we need to access from the generator:</p> <pre class="language-xml"><code class="language-xml"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>Project</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

</code></pre> <p>This ensures the <code>EnableEnumGeneratorInterceptor</code> setting is available from the <em>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</em> source generator.</p> <p>Next, we need to make sure we pack the <em>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.props</em> file into the correct place in the NuGet package. The following line in the <em>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.csproj</em> project file makes sure the file is packed into the <code>build</code> folder of the package:</p> <pre class="language-xml"><code class="language-xml"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>None</span> <span class="token attr-name">Include</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.props<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">Visible</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>false<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span>

</code></pre> <p>And that's all there is too it! When you run <code>dotnet pack</code> on the project, the resulting NuGet package has the file in the correct place:</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2025/generator_props.png" alt="The NuGet package now includes the file"></p> <p>What's more, any projects consuming the package can <em>just</em> define the property, they don't need to mess around with <code>&lt;CompilerVisibleProperty&gt;</code>:</p> <pre class="language-xml"><code class="language-xml"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>Project</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

Unfortunately, the very design of interceptors makes that a little tricky.</p> <p>Interceptors can be a little confusing, so they require an explicit opt-in from consuming projects. <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/features/interceptors.md#user-opt-in">Users must specify</a> the property <code>&lt;InterceptorsNamespaces&gt;</code> in their project, which is a list of namespaces that are allowed to contain interceptors. For example:</p> <pre class="language-xml"><code class="language-xml"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>InterceptorsNamespaces</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>$(InterceptorsNamespaces);Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Generated;<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>InterceptorsNamespaces</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre> <p>That makes my goal for a "simple one property activation" a little tricky; are users are always going to have to update the main setting <em>and</em> <code>&lt;InterceptorsNamespaces&gt;</code> to use my interceptor? Well, yes and no.</p> <p>In my solution to this issue, I took some inspiration from the built-in source generator interceptors that ship with the .NET runtime—the ASP.NET Core <a href="/exploring-the-dotnet-8-preview-changing-method-calls-with-interceptors/#updating-the-minimal-api-generator-to-use-interceptors">minimal API interceptor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/9cf8a80db3354173cfd25dea4660632861dee0eb/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder">the configuration binder interceptor</a>. The configuration binder is particularly interesting, as it behaves exactly as I want: setting <code>&lt;EnableConfigurationBindingGenerator&gt;</code> to <code>true</code> automatically adds the required <code>&lt;InterceptorsNamespaces&gt;</code> values.</p> <p>The configuration binder interceptor achieves this using some NuGet and MSBuild fun:</p> <ul><li>You can add MSBuild properties and items using a <code>.props</code> file in a NuGet file</li> <li>However, customers can set the property in many different ways. That means you don't know exactly <em>when</em> the value of the property be the "final" value.</li> <li>Consequently, reading the value in a <code>.targets</code> file is the "safest" way to do this, as those are executed after all the various <code>.props</code> files have executed</li></ul> <p>Based on this, the following approach is what I opted for in my <em>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</em> package.</p> <p>Add a <code>&lt;Package&gt;.targets</code> file (<code>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.targets</code> in my case) containing a <code>&lt;Target&gt;</code> that runs before other defined targets, which sets the <code>&lt;InterceptorsNamespaces&gt;</code> property based on the value of the <code>&lt;EnableEnumGeneratorInterceptor&gt;</code> property:</p> <pre class="language-xml"><code class="language-xml"><span class="token comment">&lt;!-- An arbitrary name for the target, chosen to avoid collisions --&gt;</span>

</code></pre> <p>and voila, interceptors!</p> <p>I haven't gone into details about the work that needs to happen in the generator to correctly enable and disable the functionality, but ultimately it comes down to reading the <code>build_property.EnableEnumGeneratorInterceptor</code> value I showed earlier. We can then bail out of interception if it's not required. If you want to see all the details, you can find the <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.EnumGenerators/blob/ce553416b9aba0a7101c559aac9d18d7b1c1805c/src/NetEscapades.EnumGenerators/EnumGenerator.cs#L53">code on GitHub</a></p> <h2 id="summary" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#summary" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Summary</a></h2> <p>In this post I described how you can read MSBuild properties from a source generator, using the <code>AnalyzerConfigOptionsProvider</code>. I showed that you need to prefix the properties with <code>build_property.</code> and explained why this is necessary, based on the <em>.editorconfig</em> file. Next I showed how you can add arbitrary additional properties to this file using <code>&lt;CompilerVisibleProperty&gt;</code> so you can read them from your source generators.</p> <p>Finally, I showed how you can add <code>.props</code> and <code>.targets</code> files to your NuGet packages so that consumers of your package don't need to add these properties themselves. I also showed a specific example of using a <code>.targets</code> file to add additional values to the <code>&lt;InterceptorsNamespaces&gt;</code> property, based on the value of a different property.</p> ]]></content:encoded><category><![CDATA[Source Generators;C#]]></category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reading compilation options and the C# version in source generators: Creating a source generator - Part 12]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this post I show how to read details of a target project from a source generator, such as assembly name, the current configuration, or the c# version]]></description><link>https://andrewlock.net/creating-a-source-generator-part-12-reading-compilation-options-and-csharp-version-in-source-generators/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://andrewlock.net/creating-a-source-generator-part-12-reading-compilation-options-and-csharp-version-in-source-generators/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew Lock]]></dc:creator><media:content url="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/lang_version_banner.webp" medium="image" /><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/lang_version_banner.webp" /><nav><p>This is the twelve post in the series: <a href="/series/creating-a-source-generator/">Creating a source generator</a>. </p> <ol class="list-none"><li><a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-1-creating-an-incremental-source-generator/">Part 1 - Creating an incremental generator</a></li><li><a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-2-testing-an-incremental-generator-with-snapshot-testing/">Part 2 - Testing an incremental generator with snapshot testing</a></li><li><a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-3-integration-testing-and-packaging/">Part 3 - Integration testing and NuGet packaging</a></li><li><a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-4-customising-generated-code-with-marker-attributes/">Part 4 - Customising generated code with marker attributes</a></li><li><a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-5-finding-a-type-declarations-namespace-and-type-hierarchy/">Part 5 - Finding a type declaration's namespace and type hierarchy</a></li><li><a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-6-saving-source-generator-output-in-source-control/">Part 6 - Saving source generator output in source control</a></li><li><a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-7-solving-the-source-generator-marker-attribute-problem-part1/">Part 7 - Solving the source generator 'marker attribute' problem - Part 1</a></li><li><a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-8-solving-the-source-generator-marker-attribute-problem-part2/">Part 8 - Solving the source generator 'marker attribute' problem - Part 2</a></li><li><a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-9-avoiding-performance-pitfalls-in-incremental-generators/">Part 9 - Avoiding performance pitfalls in incremental generators</a></li><li><a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-10-testing-your-incremental-generator-pipeline-outputs-are-cacheable/">Part 10 - Testing your incremental generator pipeline outputs are cacheable</a></li><li><a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-11-implementing-an-interceptor-with-a-source-generator/">Part 11 - Implementing an interceptor with a source generator</a></li><li>Part 12 - Reading compilation options and the C# version in source generators (this post) </li><li><a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-13-providing-and-accessing-msbuild-settings-in-source-generators/">Part 13 - Accessing MSBuild properties and user configuration from source generators</a></li><li><a href="/creating-a-source-generator-part-14-supporting-multiple-sdk-versions-in-a-source-generator/">Part 14 - Supporting multiple .NET SDK versions in a source generator</a></li></ol></nav><p>In this post I show how to access information about the project a source generator is running in, such as the C# version, the name of the assembly, or the current configuration (<code>Debug</code> or <code>Release</code>).</p> <h2 id="why-might-you-need-details-about-the-compilation-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#why-might-you-need-details-about-the-compilation-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Why might you need details about the compilation?</a></h2> <p>If you're writing a source generator, you're generating C# source code that is included in the target project's compilation. But you have to be careful—which C# features are you using in your generated code? Do you know which features you <em>can</em> safely use?</p> <p>For example, if you're building a source generator that could be used with the .NET 6 or 7 SDK, then you <em>can't</em> just assume that you can use <a href="/series/behind-the-scenes-of-collection-expressions/">collection expressions</a>. Collection expressions were introduced in C# 12 (along with .NET 8), and <em>can</em> be used when you're targeting earlier framework versions of .NET, as long as you're using a new enough version of the .NET SDK and are using C# 12 or higher.</p> <p>Depending on the code you're generating, that means you should <em>potentially</em> be generating different code based on the consuming project's C# version. Collection expressions are a great example that necessitate this, as in general, you <em>should</em> use them where you can, because <a href="/behind-the-scenes-of-collection-expressions-part-2-exploring-the-generated-code-list-and-fallback-cases/#optimizing-listt">they can improve runtime performance</a>.</p> <p>Yes, that's kind of a pain, and it seems <em>generally</em> quite rare to bother with the added complexity, outside of the generators that ship with the runtime. And even in those cases, they <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/dae890906431049d32e24d498a1d707a441a64a8/src/libraries/System.Text.RegularExpressions/gen/RegexGenerator.cs#L296-L302">tend to just bail out of generation entirely</a> rather than support multiple SDK versions.</p> <blockquote> <p>Interestingly, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/61094">there was a proposal</a> a few years ago to let the version of C# used in the generator be <em>higher</em> than that used in the rest of the project. This may have solved the issue in some cases, but it didn't go anywhere due to the additional complexity it would have added to the compiler and/or IDEs.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the following sections I'll show how to access some basic compilation settings, and then we'll move onto detecting and working with the C# version.</p> <h2 id="accessing-details-about-the-compilation-from-a-source-generator" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#accessing-details-about-the-compilation-from-a-source-generator" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Accessing details about the compilation from a source generator</a></h2> <p>We'll start by retrieving some static compilation settings like the platform being compiled for (e.g. <code>x64</code>, <code>x86</code>, or, more likely, <code>AnyCPU</code>) and the configuration setting (<code>Debug</code> or <code>Release</code>).

The only real complexity is when you're referencing a version of <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em> that doesn't contain the <code>LanguageVersion</code> property you need.</p> <blockquote> <p>The version of the <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em> package ties directly to a specific version of the Rosyln API and .NET SDK, so you often can't "simply" update the package, as that reduces the range of SDKs your source generator works on. I'll talk more about this in a subsequent post.</p> </blockquote> <p>For example, in the above code I worked around the fact that <code>CSharp12</code> wasn't an option in the <code>4.4.0</code> version of <em>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</em>. But what if I needed to specialise for <code>CSharp13</code>? I couldn't use any cute <code>&lt;=</code> tricks for that…</p> <p>I think the best option in that scenario is to use the fact that the values for future C# versions use known <code>int</code> values, and to "cast" to the correct value, for example:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token comment">// test for C#13 or higher</span>

The APIs have evolved a little since they were first introduced in .NET 8, so in this post I show how to use the new APIs with a source generator.</p> <blockquote> <p>This post is a follow on <a href="/recent-updates-for-netescapades-enumgenerators-interceptors/">from a recent post</a> in which I described the preview interceptor support I added to my <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetEscapades.EnumGenerators">NetEscapades.EnumGenerators NuGet package</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>I start by explaining what interceptors are, why they can be useful, and scenarios where they're already being used. I then show how the new interceptor APIs work, and how you can use them in your own source generators.</p> <h2 id="what-are-interceptors-and-why-do-we-need-them-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#what-are-interceptors-and-why-do-we-need-them-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">What are interceptors, and why do we need them?</a></h2> <p>Interceptors are an interesting new feature, first introduced in experimental form in C#12, that allow you to replace (or "intercept") a method call in your application with an alternative method. When your app is compiled, the compiler automatically "swaps out" the call to the original method with your substitute.</p> <p>An obvious question here is <em>why</em> would you want to do that? Why not just call the substitute method directly? In general, that is the simplest solution, but in reality that may not be possible. There's a lot of existing code written, and asking everyone to update their code to use new APIs isn't necessarily feasible.</p> <p>But why would it be so urgent to use new APIs?</p> <p>The main reason is ahead-of-time compilation (AOT) which <a href="/exploring-the-dotnet-8-preview-the-minimal-api-aot-template/">I've discussed several times in a previous series</a>. Interceptors aren't <em>specifically</em> for AOT, but it's one of the clearest use cases. By using interceptors you could take code which previously wasn't AOT friendly, and replace it with an AOT-friendly source-generated version.</p> <p>Customer's don't need to change their code, the source generator just automatically "upgrades" the method calls to use source-generated versions of the APIs that are compatible with AOT instead. If that sounds familiar, it's because that's exactly what the <a href="/exploring-the-dotnet-8-preview-using-the-new-configuration-binder-source-generator/">configuration source generator</a> and <a href="/exploring-the-dotnet-8-preview-exploring-the-new-minimal-api-source-generator/">existing minimal API source generator</a> do in .NET 8 and later.</p> <p>Interceptors are particularly interesting because they're the one case where source generators can be used to <em>change</em> existing code. Normally source generators can only <em>add</em> additional code.</p> <blockquote> <p>For a video discussion of interceptors, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1_QeH1yAto&amp;list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oX-DBuRG4u58ZTAJgBAeQ-t&amp;index=12">there was a great discussion a year ago on the .NET community standup a year or so ago</a>. It's a little out of date now, but I still recommend it.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's all quite abstract, so in the next section I'll show a very simple example of an interceptor, so that you can understand the mechanics of how they work.</p> <h2 id="an-interceptor-in-practice" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#an-interceptor-in-practice" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">An interceptor in practice</a></h2> <p>To demonstrate how interceptors work, I'll show a small example using my <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetEscapades.EnumGenerators">NetEscapades.EnumGenerators NuGet package</a>. This package provides an <code>[EnumExtensions]</code> attribute that you can apply to an enum. <a href="/recent-updates-for-netescapades-enumgenerators-interceptors/">When enabled, it can also generate interceptors for calls to <code>ToString()</code></a>.</p> <h3 id="the-original-example-without-interceptors" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#the-original-example-without-interceptors" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">The original example without interceptors</a></h3> <p>Lets say you have the following simple program. It defines an enum, <code>MyEnum</code>, which is decorated with the <code>[EnumExtensions]</code> attribute. The program itself simply creates an instance of the enum, and calls <code>ToString()</code> on it:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">using</span> <span class="token namespace">NetEscapades<span class="token punctuation">.</span>EnumGenerators</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

</code></pre> <p>The <code>[InterceptsLocation]</code> attribute is what makes the <code>MyEnumExtensionsToString()</code> method an <em>interceptor</em>. At compile time, the compiler replaces the call to <code>ToString()</code> with the call to <code>MyEnumExtensionsToString()</code>, something like the following:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">Console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">WriteLine</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>EnumInterceptors<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">MyEnumExtensionsToString</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">value</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre> <p>The library automatically detects all the calls to <code>MyEnum.ToString()</code> and adds an <code>[InterceptsLocation]</code> attribute for each instance. That means you don't have to remember to call <code>ToStringFast()</code> yourself, you can just let the interceptor handle it itself!</p> <h3 id="emitting-the-interceptslocationattribute-definition" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#emitting-the-interceptslocationattribute-definition" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Emitting the <code>InterceptsLocationAttribute</code> definition</a></h3> <p>The compiler looks for the <code>[InterceptsLocation]</code> attribute to identify interceptors, but the library itself <em>also</em> emits the <code>[InterceptsLocation]</code> attribute, rather than relying on the attribute to be defined in the runtime. This is a similar pattern as used for many other compiler features, as it does not tie the feature to a specific runtime version.</p> <p>When generating the enum interceptors, the <em>NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</em> library also generates the <code>[InterceptsLocation]</code> attribute definition itself, as shown below:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">using</span> <span class="token namespace">System</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

Only version <code>1</code> is currently defined, but the compiler may introduce new encodings in the future</li> <li><code>data</code>: An encoding defining the location to intercept, that's not intended to be human-readable. The version <code>1</code> encoding is a base64-encoding of the following: <ul><li>16 byte xxHash128 content checksum of the file containing the intercepted call.</li> <li><code>int32</code> in little-endian format for the position (i.e. <code>SyntaxNode.Position</code>) of the call in syntax.</li> <li>utf-8 string data containing a file name, used for error reporting.</li></ul> </li></ul> <blockquote> <p>Note that these argument is a big change from the <em>previous</em> experimental interceptor <code>[InterceptsLocation]</code> attribute, which used the human-readable values <code>[InterceptsLocation(path, line, column)]</code>.

This also means interceptors are <em>only</em> really feasible for use with source generators now.</p> </blockquote> <p>If it looks difficult to generate the <code>data</code> argument correctly, then don't worry, you don't have to!

</code></pre> <p>And that's all there is to the mechanics of interceptors. I've glossed over some complexities such as actually <em>enabling</em> interceptors and how to gracefully handle an insufficient SDK version, but I'll dig into those in later posts.</p> <p>Before I close this post, I'll quickly address the "experimental" part of interceptors.</p> <h2 id="what-is-the-status-of-the-interceptors-feature-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#what-is-the-status-of-the-interceptors-feature-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">What is the status of the interceptors feature?</a></h2> <p>When I recently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/andrewlock.bsky.social/post/3la7xn745a72y">announced</a> preview support for <a href="/recent-updates-for-netescapades-enumgenerators-interceptors/">interceptors in NetEscapades.EnumGenerators</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonbock.net">Jason Bock</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonbock.net/post/3lalxlvnmjs2r">pointed out that,</a> at that point, interceptors were still described as experimental, and not listed as an official feature.</p> <p>However, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76312">a recent PR</a> explicitly updated the docs. Specifically, that PR:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/98ea496177bc8e607dbf454abd6b5a5e4678aed2/docs/features/interceptors.md">Updates the docs</a> to describe the feature as stable in .NET 9.0.2xx SDK and later.</li> <li>Removed the <code>[Experimental]</code> attribute from the APIs.</li> <li>Marked the old <code>[InterceptsLocation(path, line, column)]</code> API as officially deprecated, with the intention of removing them later.</li></ul> <p>On that basis, I think it's now safe to look into interceptors more broadly. Interceptors have been used both <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/55152">by ASP.NET Core</a> and by <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/101079">the configuration binder source generator</a> to provide support for AOT, so they've been tested in real production scenarios too.</p> <p>That said, the waters are still a <em>little</em> murky. The <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/410cfaed5528d1b7e92a25cc15993017912b6afd/Language-Version-History.md">C# features list</a> still doesn't include interceptors as a feature yet, though I suspect that's just an oversight. You also still need to "opt-in" to individual interceptors by adding the namespace of the interceptor in the <code>&lt;InterceptorsNamespaces&gt;</code> MSBuild property. There doesn't seem to be any intention to change that behaviour, as it provides an easy layer of control over any interceptors added to your project.</p> <p>Taking all that into account, interceptors are now considered stable, so I think it's worth looking into and understanding them. There may not be as many use cases for them as there are for source generators in general, but they provide interesting opportunities for some scenarios.</p> <h2 id="summary" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#summary" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Summary</a></h2> <p>In this post I described the interceptor support introduced in the .NET 8 and 9 SDKs. Interceptors can replace a method call with another at compile time, which is particularly useful for some scenarios like Ahead Of Time compilation. I showed how the APIs have changed recently, and how you can use these new APIs to create an interceptor using a source generator. In the .NET 9.0.2xx SDK interceptors are considered a stable language feature, so it's worth looking into to see if they can solve any use cases that can't be handled another way.</p> ]]></content:encoded><category><![CDATA[Source Generators;C#]]></category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building LaTeX projects on Windows easily with Docker]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this post I describe how I build LaTeX projects on a Windows machine by using Docker and the blang/latex image]]></description><link>https://andrewlock.net/building-latex-projects-on-windows-easily-with-docker/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://andrewlock.net/building-latex-projects-on-windows-easily-with-docker/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew Lock]]></dc:creator><media:content url="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2024/latex_windows.webp" medium="image" /><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2024/latex_windows.webp" /><p>In this short post I describe how I build LaTeX projects on a Windows machine by using Docker. There's nothing particularly novel or exciting about this, someone just asked me about it recently so this is effectively my reply!</p> <h2 id="typesetting-documents-with-latex" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#typesetting-documents-with-latex" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Typesetting documents with LaTeX</a></h2> <p>I love using markdown for writing documentation, blog posts, <a href="https://obsidian.md/">notes</a>, or anything I can. Even with a very simple editor, you can have something that roughly <em>looks</em> like the markup that you want to produce. But markdown is generally tied closely to HTML (though this is not strictly required), and sometimes you want or need to produce a standalone document, like a PDF, for which HTML isn't generally well suited.</p> <p>For those rare cases where I want to produce a nice looking document, such as a CV, I fallback to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>. LaTeX is a markup language that is explicitly about typesetting <em>documents</em> so it cares deeply about pages and margins, which contrasts with HTML markup. You then use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">TeX</a> distribution to render the LaTeX document as a PDF (or other format).</p> <blockquote> <p>LaTeX performs the same general function as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editors like Google Docs or Microsoft Word. However, LaTeX is <em>not</em> WYSIWYG (requiring an exxplicit rendering step) which can make it harder to use in general, but this all can enable broader optimisations and produce better looking documents overall.</p> </blockquote> <p>LaTeX is very common in the scientific community in particular, with papers often being written in LaTeX. It is also particularly good for writing large documents, which is why I used it to write my PhD thesis. However, that was years ago. When I came to work with LaTeX again recently, I was reminded that working with it on Windows was not obvious.</p> <h2 id="rendering-latex-on-windows" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#rendering-latex-on-windows" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Rendering LaTeX on Windows</a></h2> <p>LaTeX comes very much from the *Nix world, which means that it's very open, and available, but also that there are thousand different "suggested" approaches to rending LaTeX documents. For people who want choice, or who care about the little details of each distribution, that's great. For people who just want to "install something" and get on with it, getting started can be confusing 😅</p> <blockquote> <p>Just to be clear, I am very much a beginner with LaTeX, despite having used it a lot 15 years ago. I still find it has a very steep learning curve (softened somewhat these days by StackOverflow and ChatGPT), but there are some things it just does better than WYSWIG editors, so I lean on it where I can now and again.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I was working on my PhD, I'm pretty sure I used <a href="https://www.texniccenter.org/">TeXnicCenter</a>, but it's been a decade since there were any updates there, and you need to manage your own TeX distribution (e.g. MiKTeX) directly if I understand correctly. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX/comments/sle89v/preferred_latex_editor/">Other common suggestions</a> include <a href="https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/">Texmaker</a>, <a href="https://www.texstudio.org/">TeXstudio</a>, or just to use VS Code, but these all still require you manage the TeX distribution yourself. Unfortunately I have bad memories of manually managing MiKTeX on Windows and really wanted to avoid that if I could help it.</p> <p>For a long while, I was using <a href="https://overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>, an online-only platform, for occasionally rendering LaTeX documents, and it worked very well for my needs. I was only rendering relatively short documents and didn't particularly need a lot of IDE or collaborative features.</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2024/overleaf.png" alt="Overleaf"></p> <p>Unfortunately, Overleaf made the individual free-plan basically unusable (rendering a two page document was "too complex"), and I couldn't justify paying a subscription for something I only used a couple of times a year.</p> <p>Using Docker seemed like the obvious choice to solve my issue: I could use VS Code as my editor (it has built-in syntax support for LaTeX), and then rending the documents using a self-contained distribution.</p> <p>Overleaf itself <em>is</em> open source, and provides Docker images for running the community edition. I looked into this initially, but it was overkill for what I needed: I didn't need multiple accounts and project storage in the Overleaf implementation itself, I just needed the <em>rendering</em> part.</p> <h2 id="building-latex-with-docker-using-blang-latex" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#building-latex-with-docker-using-blang-latex" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Building LaTeX with Docker using <code>blang/latex</code></a></h2> <p>Eventually I found <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/blang/latex">the <code>blang/latex</code> docker images</a>, which do exactly what I want—an Ubuntu-based image, with everything you need to compile locally in docker. The <code>blang/latex</code> come in three different flavours:</p> <ul><li><code>blang/latex:ubuntu</code> (<a href="https://github.com/blang/latex-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile.ubuntu">Dockerfile</a>)—Ubuntu TexLive distribution: Old but stable, most needed packages(3.9GB)</li> <li><code>blang/latex:ctanbasic</code> (<a href="https://github.com/blang/latex-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile.basic">Dockerfile</a>)— CTAN TexLive Scheme-basic: Up-to-date, only basic packages, base for custom builds (500MB)</li> <li><code>blang/latex:ctanfull</code> (<a href="https://github.com/blang/latex-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile.full">Dockerfile</a>)— CTAN TexLive Scheme-full: Up-to-date, all packages (5.6GB)</li></ul> <p>The more complete versions are obviously quite big images, but as I was only going to be pulling them once locally and running them repeatedly to build, I wasn't particularly worried about that. For simplicity I went with the <code>ctanfull</code> tag which contains the <em>full</em> set of <a href="http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive">CTAN packages</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/blang/latex">The docker hub page</a> describes how you can use these images to build your LaTeX project, but I decided to go with something a bit different. I created two files in the root of my project.</p> <ul><li><code>build.ps1</code>—This script runs (or restarts) the docker <code>blang/latex</code> container.</li> <li><code>build.sh</code>—This simple script runs <em>inside</em> the docker container, and does the latex build.</li></ul> <p>The scrcipts themselves are <em>very</em> simple. First we have the <code>build.ps1</code> script:</p> <pre class="language-powershell"><code class="language-powershell"><span class="token comment"># Try to start an existing container, if it exists</span>
docker <span class="token function">start</span> <span class="token operator">-</span>a <span class="token operator">-</span>i <span class="token string">"latex-builder"</span>

    blang/latex:ctanfull <span class="token operator">/</span>bin/bash
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre> <p>This script attempts to start a docker container using the <code>blang/latex:ctanfull</code> image, using the name <code>latex-builder</code>, and attaches stdin/stdout/stderr. If the container already exists and is stopped, then this just restarts the same image and connects to the container. If the container with the name <code>latex-builder</code> <em>doesn't</em> exist, the script starts a new container, mounts the root directory inside the image at <code>/data</code>, and opens a <code>bash</code> shell.</p> <blockquote> <p>This doesn't <em>strictly</em> work as I would like, as depending on how you later exit a re-started container, the exit code may be non-null, which causes the script to (harmlessly) try to start a new container, fail, and show an error. It's not a big deal, but it's slightly annoying, and I'm sure I'm missing an obvious solution here!</p> </blockquote> <p>Once the container is running, you can build by running <code>.\build.sh</code> inside the container. The <code>build.sh</code> script is specific to each project and looks something like this:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token shebang important">#!/bin/sh</span>

lualatex <span class="token parameter variable">--jobname</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"My CV"</span>  main.tex
</code></pre> <p>This simple script runs lualatex to render the <code>main.tex</code> LaTeX document as a PDF. Thanks to mounting the directory, this appears on the "Windows side" automatically. I keep the docker container running in a window, iterate on the LaTeX files in an editor, and then when I want to see the changes, quickly flick to the terminal and run<code> build.sh</code> in the container. It's exactly the workflow I was hoping for.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note that you could also use <code>pdflatex</code> or <code>latexmk</code> instead of <code>lualatex</code> if you prefer, as described <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/blang/latex">in the docs</a> for <code>blang/latex</code>.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="why-use-two-separate-files-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#why-use-two-separate-files-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Why use two separate files?</a></h2> <p>You might be wondering why I opted to keep the docker image container running, necessitating both a <code>build.ps1</code> <em>and</em> <code>build.sh</code> file? It's true that you <em>could</em> run everything all in one command. For example, you could combine the scripts above as follows:</p> <pre class="language-powershell"><code class="language-powershell"><span class="token variable">$ROOT_DIR</span>=<span class="token string">"<span class="token variable">$PSScriptRoot</span>"</span>

docker run <span class="token operator">-</span>it <span class="token operator">--</span><span class="token function">rm</span>`
  <span class="token operator">--</span><span class="token function">mount</span> <span class="token string">"type=bind,source=<span class="token variable">$ROOT_DIR</span>,target=/data"</span> `
  <span class="token operator">--</span>name <span class="token string">"latex-builder"</span> `
  blang/latex:ctanfull `
  lualatex <span class="token operator">--</span>jobname=<span class="token string">"My CV"</span>  main<span class="token punctuation">.</span>tex
</code></pre> <p>The problem with this approach is that it starts a new container every time. But when you first run <code>luatex</code> (and, I assume <code>pdflatex</code> and others), it performs some one-time setup, similar to the following</p> <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">root@67d3d81c4129:~<span class="token comment"># ./build.sh</span>

</code></pre> <p>As you can see, on this "first run", <code>luatex</code> has to build the font-name database cache. On my old laptop this only takes 5-10s, but it's an annoying extra delay for the "inner-loop" experience, where the remainder of the build only takes a couple of seconds. By reusing an existing container we can skip that initialization entirely, and go straight to the build!</p> <p>That said, if you want to also have a build that runs in CI, then the one-shot approach obviously makes sense.

It's emerged as the markup language of choice for "cloud native" configuration, whether that's Kubernetes manifests, docker compose files, or GitHub Action workflows. On the one hand, it's a generally-easy-to-read format, and a strict superset of JSON. On the other hand, the significant whitespace can be a nightmare if you don't have decent tooling 😅</p> <p>Either way, people clearly choose to use it, even if they don't have to. Years ago I wrote a small ASP.NET Core library, <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetEscapades.Configuration.Yaml">NetEscapades.Configuration.Yaml</a> that reads YAML files in as part of ASP.NET Core's standard <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration">configuration system</a>. Judging from the <a href="https://nugettrends.com/packages?ids=NetEscapades.Configuration.Yaml&amp;months=72">NuGet Trends data</a>, YAML is not going away any time soon!</p> <p><img src="/content/images/2024/nuget_trends.png" alt="The NuGet downloads for the NetEscapades.Configuration.Yaml library"></p> <p>Under the hood, <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetEscapades.Configuration.Yaml">NetEscapades.Configuration.Yaml</a> uses <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/YamlDotNet/">YamlDotNet</a> to read the YAML files. <a href="https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet">YamlDotNet</a> is <em>the</em> YAML parser for .NET—with ~245 Million downloads it's effectively the "Newtonsoft.Json for YAML".</p> <p>There are several ways to work with YAML files with YamlDotNet. If you need to, you can <a href="https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/wiki/Samples.LoadingAYamlStream">manipulate a high-level representation of the YAML</a> (e.g. <code>YamlScalarNode</code>, <code>YamlMappingNode</code> etc) if you need to work with the YAML document directly.</p> <p>A more common approach is to serialize your YAML to and from strongly-typed objects, just like you'd do with Newtonsoft.Json or System.Text.Json. For example, the following code shows how to deserialize a YAML document into a strongly-typed <code>Person</code> object using YamlDotNet:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">using</span> <span class="token namespace">YamlDotNet<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Serialization</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

Normally, when you publish and deploy a .NET application, your application is compiled into Intermediate Language (IL). When the .NET runtime runs your application it uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to convert your IL into machine-language instructions which can actually be executed by processor.</p> <p>In contrast, Native AOT performs the IL to machine-language conversion during a <code>dotnet publish</code>. It produces a single binary, targeting a single platform (for example <code>x64</code> Windows or <code>arm64</code> Linux), which contains the complete .NET runtime, all the base-class libraries, and your application. To keep the size of this file down, NativeAOT automatically "trims" any unused types and members from your application <em>and</em> from the underlying platform.</p> <blockquote> <p>When choosing between IL+JIT or Native AOT there are a number of trade offs to consider. I won't go into those exhaustively here, and instead will just highlight a few.</p> </blockquote> <p>Advantages to using the IL+JIT approach include:</p> <ul><li>The JIT can optimise the machine-language generated for the specific capabilities of the processor currently executing, which may mean it can produce faster code than Native AOT would.</li> <li>You're free to use meta-programming approaches such as reflection (e.g. <code>Assembly.LoadFile</code>) and run-time code generation (e.g. <code>System.Reflection.Emit</code>).</li> <li>You can use any .NET library available; they're all designed to be used in this mode.</li></ul> <p>Whereas Native AOT brings other advantages:</p> <ul><li>Native AOT typically allows significantly faster startup times, as there's no need to load all the types, start the JIT compiler, and generate machine code from IL; the app starts executing almost immediately.</li> <li>The size of a Native AOT app is typically <em>much</em> smaller than the overall footprint of a JIT app (runtime + base class libraries + application), as any unused features are trimmed and removed.</li> <li>Runtime memory usage is typically smaller, as the runtime has to do less work (it doesn't need to run the JIT compiler, load types, have debugger support).</li></ul> <blockquote> <p>Michal Strehovsky gave a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmn-4mVSjq4&amp;ab_channel=dotnet">Deep dive on Native AOT</a> talk at .NET Conf 2024; if you're interested in Native AOT I strongly suggest taking a look at it!</p> </blockquote> <p>The big downside to using Native AOT publishing is that the compiler needs to be able to <em>statically</em> understand which types in your application are <em>actually</em> going to be used. That is particularly difficult for functionality that leans heavily on <em>reflection</em>. And guess what, serialization and deserialization typically does just that.</p> <h2 id="source-generation-to-the-rescue-" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#source-generation-to-the-rescue-" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Source generation to the rescue!</a></h2> <p>Reflection is often problematic for Native AOT, as it can quickly become difficult for the compiler to know which types are <em>actually</em> being used. For example, the following code would (potentially) work fine when you're running with a JIT:</p> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">Console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">WriteLine</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Enter a type to load"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

</code></pre> <p>There's clearly no way for the compiler to know ahead of time what type will be requested, so there's pretty much no way Native AOT is going to work with this sort of pattern.</p> <blockquote> <p>This example is obviously very contrived, but it's actually similar to how some plugin systems work in practice!</p> </blockquote> <p>In other scenarios we use reflection primarily because it was historically the only tool available to us. This is often the case for serialization and deserialization. Serializers commonly use reflection to inspect the properties of objects so they can be created from a given document, whether that's XML, JSON, or YAML.</p> <p>However, with the introduction of source generators, we now have another tool. Instead of inspecting types at <em>runtime</em> to generate the mapping code from documents-to-types, source generators allow us to move that work to <em>compile</em> time. This can give performance improvements (as there's less work to do at runtime), but more importantly (for this case) it also means our code is statically analyzable, and can potentially support Native AOT.</p> <blockquote> <p>I've written a lot about source generators: I have a series on <a href="/series/creating-a-source-generator/">creating an incremental source generator here</a> and have described some of the source generators I've created <a href="/recent-updates-for-netescapades-enumgenerators-interceptors/">here</a> and <a href="https://andrewlock.net/updates-to-the-stronglytypedid-library/">here</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>It's important to be aware that using source generation for serialization <em>typically</em> requires making code changes. For example, using source generation with System.Text.Json (the built-in JSON serializer) requires</p> <ul><li>Creating a <code>JsonSerializerContract</code>.</li> <li>Applying <code>[JsonSerializable]</code> with the types to generate.</li> <li>Explicitly calling serialization method overloads that use the <code>JsonSerializerContract</code>.</li></ul> <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token class-name"><span class="token keyword">string</span></span> json <span class="token operator">=</span>

</code></pre> <p>Source generation in System.Text.Json has got progressively better over recent releases, so that many of the gaps and issues that were once there have been resolved. However, I wasn't aware until recently that YamlDotNet has a similar source generator for serializing YAML.</p> <h2 id="using-source-generation-with-yamldotnet" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#using-source-generation-with-yamldotnet" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">Using source generation with YamlDotNet</a></h2> <p>I was recently working on a project that I wanted to publish using NativeAOT. It involved reading some Markdown files <a href="https://github.com/xoofx/markdig">using Markdig</a>, reading <a href="https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/YamlSpecs.md">the YAML frontmatter</a>, and parsing the YAML.</p> <p>Initially, I thought I might have a problem. There's no real mention of Native AOT or source generation that I could see <a href="https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/wiki">in the YamlDotNet Wiki</a>. However <a href="https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/issues/740">this issue</a> requesting support for Native AOT was marked complete and there was a sample called <a href="https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/tree/master/YamlDotNet.Core7AoTCompileTest">YamlDotNet.Core7AoTCompileTest</a>, and sure enough, it was possible!</p> <p>To use the YamlDotNet source generation in your project, you need to do 4 things:</p> <ul><li>Add a reference to <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Vecc.YamlDotNet.Analyzers.StaticGenerator">Vecc.YamlDotNet.Analyzers.StaticGenerator</a>.</li> <li>Create a class derived from <code>YamlDotNet.Serialization.StaticContext</code>.</li> <li>Annotate this class with the types you wish to use with source generation.</li> <li>Use the <code>StaticDeserializerBuilder</code> instead of <code>DeserializerBuilder</code> to build your <code>IDeserializer</code></li></ul> <p>I'll walk through each of those steps in the following sections.</p> <h3 id="1-add-a-reference-to-vecc-yamldotnet-analyzers-staticgenerator" class="heading-with-anchor"><a href="#1-add-a-reference-to-vecc-yamldotnet-analyzers-staticgenerator" class="relative text-zinc-800 dark:text-white no-underline hover:underline">1.
