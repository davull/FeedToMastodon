<p>Home Assistant 2025.6! üéâ</p>
<p>We are already half way through 2025, can you believe it? I personally can‚Äôt, as it feels like we just started the year. Not just that, there are so many exciting things to still come this year, and I can‚Äôt wait to share them with you!</p>
<p>Anyway, the June release is here! A week later than usual, but it also means we had an extra week to polish and beta test this release. Like the <a href="/blog/2025/05/07/release-20255/">previous release</a>, this release is packed with quality-of-life improvements!</p>
<p>Last release my favorite feature was the new entity picker; this release, we improved ALL other pickers! No surprise that this, again, makes it to my top favorite this release. Although the ability to group media players directly from the media player card is a close second. It is so nice to see how Home Assistant keeps getting better and better, and how our community keeps contributing to it. üòç</p>
<p>If you are leveraging Bluetooth in your Home Assistant setup, you will also love the new Bluetooth connection graph that shows how your Bluetooth devices are connected, including Bluetooth proxies. Troubleshooting Bluetooth has become so much easier now!</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>
<p>../Frenck</p>
<p><em>PS: We will pick up the regular release schedule again now, so expect the next release on the first Wednesday of July (July 2nd).</em></p>

<h2>Improving all the ‚Äúpickers‚Äù</h2>
<p>Pickers are those dropdowns you use to select entities, devices, areas, and more. Pickers are <em>everywhere</em> in Home Assistant, being used in automations, scripts, and configuration options.</p>
<p>Last release, we <a href="/blog/2025/05/07/release-20255/#picking-entities">introduced a new entity picker</a>, which was a big hit! This release takes things further by refining the search experience based on your feedback.</p>
<p>Even better, that same improved search experience now comes to the area, category, floor, label, user, and device pickers too! They are consistent, fast, and easy to use, no matter what you‚Äôre selecting.</p>
<p>And the device picker? It now has a fresh look to match, complete with manufacturer logos and styling inspired by the entity picker.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the new device picker, including the area and integration that provides them." src="/images/blog/2025-06/new-device-picker.png" />
<h2>Making sense of Bluetooth</h2>
<p>Home Assistant has powerful <a href="/integrations/bluetooth">Bluetooth capabilities</a>, and with the use of something like <a href="https://esphome.io/projects/?type=bluetooth">ESPHome Bluetooth proxies</a>, you can extend your Bluetooth network to cover your entire home. This release brings some improvements to the Bluetooth integration that will help you understand your Bluetooth network better.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth integration now provides a visualization that shows how your Bluetooth devices are connected to your Home Assistant instance, whether that‚Äôs directly to your system or through a Bluetooth proxy.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showcasing the new Bluetooth connection graph; Even Bluetooth proxies are shown in the map." src="/images/blog/2025-06/bluetooth-connection-graph.png" />
<p>It not only shows the actively connected devices, but also the devices that are in range, but not yet known to Home Assistant. This is a great way to see what devices are around you and where they can be potentially connected.</p>
<p>Oh! And now that the Bluetooth integration has a sleek new visualization, the <a href="/integrations/zha">Zigbee integration</a>, which already has a similar feature, has been given a visual update. This makes visualizations consistent across Home Assistant.</p>
<h2>Iterations of the experimental area dashboard</h2>
<p>In the April release, we introduced a <a href="/blog/2025/04/02/release-20254/#a-new-experimental-areas-dashboard">new experimental Areas dashboard</a>, which automatically generates a ready-to-use dashboard based on the areas you‚Äôve set up in your home. It uses sections and tile cards for a modern, clean, and intuitive look ‚Äî all built for you in a couple of clicks.</p>
<p>As this is experimental, it is being continuously iterated on. This release brings some nice changes, based on your feedback, to subtly refine the experience.</p>
<p>We added a new ‚ÄúActions‚Äù section that includes scripts, automations, and scenes. We also added number entities (and number helpers), button entities (and button helpers), counters, and timer helpers to the ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù section. This makes it easier to find and manage your automations and scenes in the context of your areas.</p>
<p>Finally, we renamed the ‚ÄúEntertainment‚Äù section to ‚ÄúMedia players‚Äù. This makes it clearer that this section is specifically for your players, and may not include your DIY arcade machine üëæ.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new areas dashboard; showcasing the new Actions section." src="/images/blog/2025-06/areas-dashboard.png" />
<h2>Deprecating installation methods and 32-bit architectures</h2>
<p>This release introduces important deprecation announcements, and though they only affect a small percentage of users, it is important that they understand the impacts. We‚Äôve written <a href="/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/">a detailed blog</a> that explains the rationale, timeline, and tips on how to migrate ‚Äî which I highly suggest reading if you think you‚Äôre affected.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Installation Methods</strong>: The <strong>Core</strong> and <strong>Supervised</strong> installation methods are now officially deprecated. These are advanced setups that are only used by a small portion of users, as they involve running Home Assistant in a Python environment or installing the Supervisor on top of your own operating system. Moving forward, we are focusing our support on the more streamlined and maintainable installation methods: <strong>Home Assistant OS</strong> and <strong>Home Assistant Container</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>32-bit Architectures</strong>: Support for legacy 32-bit CPU architectures (<strong>i386</strong>, <strong>armhf</strong>, and <strong>armv7</strong>) is also being deprecated. These architectures are increasingly uncommon and pose challenges for maintaining compatibility and performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To assist you during this transition, Home Assistant will now raise a <strong>repair issue</strong> after upgrading if your system is affected by these deprecations. This notification will appear in the repair dashboard, providing information about the deprecation along with guidance on how to migrate to a supported setup.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs important to note that while these methods and architectures are deprecated, they will continue to receive support for the next six months, until the release of Home Assistant 2025.12. You can continue to use them after this point, but we would highly recommend migrating. After this 6-month period, they will become unsupported, meaning they will no longer receive updates or official assistance.</p>
<p>If you don‚Äôt receive this repair message, you‚Äôre not affected. However, you can double-check using <a href="/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/#what-does-deprecated-and-unsupported-mean">our guide</a> if you‚Äôd like. We also have specific information on what becoming deprecated and unsupported <a href="/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/#what-does-deprecated-and-unsupported-mean">means for your installation</a>. Lastly, we have detailed information on <a href="/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/#how-to-migrate">how best to migrate</a> to a supported system.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Integration quality scale achievements</h3>
<p>One thing we are incredibly proud of in Home Assistant is our
<a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/quality_scale/">integration quality scale</a>. This scale helps us and our contributors to ensure
integrations are of high quality, maintainable, and provide the best possible
user experience.</p>
<p>This release, we celebrate several <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> that have improved
their quality scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1 integration reached gold</strong> ü•á</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/integrations/switchbot">SwitchBot</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zerzhang">@zerzhang</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1 integration reached silver</strong> ü•à</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/integrations/shelly">Shelly</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/bieniu">@bieniu</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a huge achievement for these integrations and their maintainers. The
effort and dedication required to reach these quality levels is significant,
as it involves extensive testing, documentation, error handling, and often
complete rewrites of parts of the integration.</p>
<p>A big thank you to all the contributors involved! üëè</p>
<h3>Farewell to the following</h3>
<p>The following <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> are also no longer available as
of this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RTSPtoWebRTC</strong> has been removed as it has been replaced by the <a href="/integrations/go2rtc">go2rtc</a> integration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other noteworthy changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A small but neat one: <a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a> made it so discoveries shown on an integration page are now sorted by title. Helpful!</li>
<li>The <a href="/integrations/cloud">Home Assistant Cloud</a> integration will now raise a repair issue when your subscription has expired, helping make sure you‚Äôre aware and not caught off guard. Nice one, <a href="https://github.com/ludeeus">@ludeeus</a>!</li>
<li>More backup improvements! üéâ
<ul>
<li>Home Assistant will now raise a repair issue if not all add-ons or folders were successfully backed up. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/emontnemery">@emontnemery</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/agners">@agners</a> made it so that when an add-on is auto-updated, a backup is now correctly created as an ‚Äúadd-on‚Äù-backup. Great!</li>
<li>A new automatic backup <a href="/integrations/event">event entity</a> has been added to track automatic backups made by the system. Great addition by <a href="https://github.com/mib1185">@mib1185</a>!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lboue">@lboue</a> added support for the <a href="/integrations/matter">Matter</a> pump device type. Another one
added to the list‚Äîawesome!</li>
<li>The Template integration got a big boost!
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a> added modern-style YAML support for template fans, locks, alarm control panels, vacuums, and covers. So clean!</li>
<li>You can now create <strong>trigger-based template covers</strong>. Yep, also by <a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a>!</li>
<li>The <code>trigger_variables</code> option is now supported when using <code>for</code> in a trigger. A small but powerful feature. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a>!</li>
<li>New template filters! You can now use <code>from_hex</code>, and <code>base64_encode</code> now supports both bytes and strings. Handy additions from <a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a>!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New sensor capabilities:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Passific">@Passific</a> added a new device class and units for <strong>reactive energy</strong>. Nice!</li>
<li>A new unit for <strong>energy distance (Wh/km)</strong> has been added. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/frenck">@frenck</a>!</li>
<li>Sensors now support <strong>mg/m¬≥</strong> as a concentration unit‚Äîanother nice addition by <a href="https://github.com/frenck">@frenck</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Arnie97">@Arnie97</a> added support for <strong>liters</strong> as a unit for gas sensors. Much appreciated!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The new <code>recorder.get_statistics</code> action lets you query statistics directly
from the recorder. Powerful stuff, <a href="https://github.com/Hypfer">@Hypfer</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sidebar improvements</h2>
<p>If you didn‚Äôt know yet, you can actually adjust the contents of your Home¬†Assistant sidebar. You can change the order and show/hide items by pressing and holding the ‚ÄúHome Assistant‚Äù text at the top of the sidebar, or by going to your user profile page and selecting ‚ÄúChange the order and hide items from the sidebar‚Äù.</p>
<p>This release brings a couple of much-needed improvements to this feature. When you customize the sidebar, it will now bring up a nice and clean dialog that allows you to drag and drop items to change their order, or hide them by clicking the eye icon next to them.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new dialog that can be used to order or hide the items in the sidebar." src="/images/blog/2025-06/sidebar-customization.png" />
<p>The biggest improvement is actually found somewhere else! Previously, the customization of the sidebar was only applied to the device you made the changes on; and even more annoying, sometimes it would lose the changes, or it would magically forget your settings on our [mobile companion apps] when you switched between your home network (and thus the internal URL). ü•≤</p>
<p>In this release, this annoyance has been fixed! The sidebar customization is now stored in your user profile, so your personalized layout follows you across all devices you use with Home Assistant!</p>
<h2>Join/unjoin groups of media players</h2>
<p>Media players in Home Assistant can provide actions for media players to join or unjoin a group of media players. This is a great way to dynamically control your media players and the groups they are in. However, this feature was somewhat limited, as it could only be used as actions within things like automations or scripts.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://github.com/AlexGustafsson">@AlexGustafsson</a> changed that! üéâ</p>
<p>You can now use the media player card to join or unjoin groups of media players. This is a great way to control your media players and their groups directly from the UI.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the media player card providing controls to group media player with the current used media player." src="/images/blog/2025-06/group-media-players-from-media-player-card.png" />
<p>Please note that, you can only join or unjoin groups of media players that support this feature. Unfortunately, not all media players support this, so it might not be available for all your media players.</p>
<p>Anyhow, amazing contribution Alex! üëè</p>
<h2>Reset/restore entity IDs</h2>
<p>You can now restore the ID of an entity to its original value. This is useful if you have renamed an entity and want to revert it back to its original entity ID.</p>
<p>This feature is available in the entity configuration dialog, where you can now find a ‚ÄúReset‚Äù icon on the entity ID field. When clicked, it will restore the entity ID to its original value. Additionally, there is the option called ‚ÄúRecreate entity IDs‚Äù in the top right three-dotted menu on the device page, to reset all entity IDs of a device to their original values.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the reset option of the entity ID in the entity configuration dialog." src="/images/blog/2025-06/reset-entity-id.png" />
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.6 in June.
These patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch
release every Friday.</p>

<p>Some sensors have changed due to the new data source:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hourly forecast provided by the weather entity now has actual hourly entries as opposed to 3-hourly in the old version</li>
<li>Instead of <code>visibility</code> and <code>visibility_distance</code> sensors showing a range and qualitative description (such as ‚Äú1-4 km‚Äù and ‚ÄúPoor‚Äù), the integration now exposes a single <code>visibility</code> sensor with precise visibility distance in meters</li>

    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-05-deprecation/art.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Deprecating Core and Supervised installation methods, and 32-bit systems">
<p>We are today officially deprecating two installation methods and three legacy CPU architectures. We always strive to have Home Assistant run on almost anything, but sometimes we must make difficult decisions to keep the project moving forward. Though these changes will only affect a small percentage of Home Assistant users, we want to do everything in our power to make this easy for those who may need to migrate.</p>
<p>Beginning with Home Assistant 2025.6, affected systems will display a notification after updating, indicating that <strong>support will end in six months (with release 2025.12)</strong> and include a recommendation to <a href="#how-to-migrate">migrate to a supported system</a>. In this post, we‚Äôll go into our thinking on these deprecations and our findings after consulting the community on these changes.</p>
<p>We have deprecated the following installation methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Home Assistant Core</strong> installation method, where you run your system in a Python environment, not to be confused with Container (for example, running your system in Docker).</li>
<li><strong>Home Assistant‚Äôs Supervised</strong> installation method, which involves running your own operating system, then installing the Supervisor and other requirements on top of that.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are advanced installation methods, with only a small percentage of the community opting to use them. If you are using these methods, you can continue to do so (you can even continue to update your system), but in six months time, you will no longer be supported, which I‚Äôll explain the impacts of in the next section. References to these installation methods will be removed from our documentation after our next release (2025.6). Going forward <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system">Home Assistant OS</a> and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/homeassistant/home-assistant">Home Assistant Container</a> will become the only supported installation methods.</p>
<p>In the future, only the currently supported 64-bit architectures (aarch64 and amd64) will be used. The following legacy architectures are being deprecated:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>i386</strong> (32-bit x86) is an architecture used by Intel and AMD predominantly before 2003, but some later processors still utilized it (e.g., early Intel Atom models).</li>
<li><strong>armhf</strong> (32-bit ARM hard-float) was used by very early single-board computers, notably the original Raspberry Pi.</li>
<li><strong>armv7</strong> (32-bit ARM) was used by a number of early single-board computers, most notably the Raspberry Pi 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are one of the few with a system using these architectures, you will receive a notification after updating to 2025.6, and it will describe how to migrate your system. In six months, your system will become unsupported and will no longer receive updates.</p>
<p><a href="#check-if-youre-affected">Check our guide to see if your current Home Assistant installation is affected.</a><!--more--></p>
<h2>What does deprecated and unsupported mean</h2>
<p>In the simplest terms, deprecation is where you stop recommending a certain feature to users as you intend to remove it soon. As we deprecated the Core and Supervised installations methods today, that means we are now working to remove all references to them from our documentation. The goal is to guide new users towards installation methods we plan to support long term, and discourage the use of those that are being phased out.</p>
<p>Even though they are being deprecated, we are committing to support them for a further six months (until release 2025.12), giving existing users time to migrate to Home Assistant OS or Container. During this time we will ensure these installation types keep functioning as normal during the deprecation period. However, after those six months have elapsed, these methods will become unsupported, which means issue reports will no longer be accepted. As these installation methods are used for the development of Home Assistant, it will still be technically possible to update them. We still would recommend migrating to a supported method, but that‚Äôs your choice.</p>
<p>As i386, armhf, and armv7 architectures have also been deprecated, we are currently removing references to them from our documentation. More importantly, they will also be subject to a six-month support window. After that support ends (from release 2025.12 onwards), we will no longer build or release distributions or containers targeting these platforms. This will mean that in six months‚Äô time, there will be no more updates for these systems, and if users encounter issues, they will no longer be able to ask for support from Home Assistant maintainers.</p>
<h2>Why we made this decision</h2>
<h3>Core and Supervised</h3>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-05-deprecation/analytics.png' alt="OS and Container represent the vast majority of installation methods">From our <a href="https://analytics.home-assistant.io/">opt-in analytics</a></p>
<p>The Core and Supervised installation methods are not only complex for users to install and maintain ‚Äî they‚Äôre also challenging for the Home Assistant team to support. In the past, there were compelling reasons, outside Home Assistant development, to run these installation methods, but for most people those reasons are disappearing. Home Assistant OS is very capable with a rich ecosystem of add-ons, while also being easy to run in a virtual machine. Container adoption has become mainstream, now being widely available along with systems having more resources to run them. Steadily, we‚Äôve seen year-on-year reductions in the percentage of Core and Supervised installations (currently standing at 2.5% and 3.3% respectively).</p>
<p>As Core and Supervised are more complex to maintain, they generate more issues that are more difficult to solve. This complexity places a disproportionate burden on our community-driven support system, where volunteers generously give their time to help others. It also takes time away from assisting the vast majority of users who are on the simpler to maintain installation methods. Along with this, new users could sometimes be swayed into running Core or Supervised, and have a bad experience that could cause them to give up on the best way to automate their home. By focusing our support and documentation on OS and Container methods, we can greatly improve the onboarding experience and ensure a smoother start for new users.</p>
<h3>Legacy 32-bit architectures</h3>
<p>Though Home Assistant is very lean and can run great on older or low-spec hardware, the architectures we‚Äôre deprecating are definitely on the leaner side of the spectrum. That probably explains why we see such low usage figures, with i386 and armhf architectures representing less than 0.5% of installations each, and armv7 at only 0.95% of installations. More than half of Home Assistant systems using armv7 have hardware that is capable of running 64-bit operating systems, like Raspberry Pi 3 and 4. This hardware can actually upgrade and migrate to a supported 64-bit version of our Home Assistant Operating System</p>
<p>The broader software and hardware industries have also shifted away from these older 32-bit systems. Most have adopted 64-bit architectures such as amd64 and aarch64, and we are seeing more projects we depend on no longer supporting these 32-bit architectures. There have already been several instances where keeping support for these architectures has held back the development of new features.</p>
<h2>Your feedback</h2>
<p>For any major change, it is our goal to make sure the community guides this decision-making. When our maintainers initially proposed these deprecations, we shared this plan with the community (in our forum, GitHub, Discord, Reddit, and other social channels), using it to gather feedback. It was a constructive, civil discussion, and we learned a couple of interesting things that have helped us move this decision forward.</p>
<p>First, our current wording is confusing to the community. Core and Supervisor are components of Home Assistant OS, but are also similar‚Äîor the same‚Äîas the names of installation methods, which is not super clear for new users. We also found these installation methods being used in ways we never expected, and there are a good number of people who were already running Home Assistant in custom and unsupported ways, not even realizing they were unsupported.</p>
<p>Many of those impacted asked for better guidance on how to migrate. A good number were unaware of our expansion of backup and restore features to all installation methods, significantly smoothing their transition to a new platform.</p>
<h2>Check if you‚Äôre affected</h2>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-05-deprecation/system-information.png' alt="what the system information dialog looks like">The blue arrow shows your installation type, and the red arrow displays the architecture.</p>
<p>If you are unsure which <strong>installation method</strong> you are running:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/system_health/">this link</a> OR Navigate to <em><strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Repairs</strong></em>, select the three-dotted menu in the top right corner, and select <em><strong>System information</strong></em>.</li>
<li>Check the Installation type field. If you are running Home Assistant OS, or Container, you are fine as the installation method deprecation doesn‚Äôt apply to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/system_health/">same window</a>, you can find the <strong>architecture</strong> as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CPU architecture field will tell you exactly which architecture you are using. If you are seeing aarch64 or x86_64 here, you are fine as the architecture deprecation doesn‚Äôt apply to you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to migrate</h2>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-05-deprecation/methods.png' alt="Installation methods and their functionality">Green are staying, and red are deprecated.</p>
<p>If it‚Äôs been a while since you‚Äôve migrated Home Assistant systems, a lot has improved over the past several years. Switching systems is as easy as <a href="/common-tasks/general/#backups">making a backup</a>, downloading it, and <a href="/common-tasks/general/#restoring-a-backup">restoring</a> it during the initialization of your new system (Home Assistant Cloud subscribers using off-site backups can restore <a href="/blog/2025/04/02/release-20254/#onboarding-with-a-home-assistant-cloud-backup">with just their password</a>). Every Home Assistant installation method now has backups, and you can restore backups from any method onto another regardless of the differences in architecture. In many cases, very little needs to be done once the restore is successful (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1kdip17/are_you_kidding_me/">to the dismay of tinkerers online</a>). Our documentation has a full list of guides on <a href="/installation/">how to install Home Assistant on different hardware</a>.</p>
<p>Before you think about migrating to a different installation method, you can always choose to stick with what you have. Just because it becomes unsupported by the Home Assistant project, it doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt keep running it like you do today. That choice is up to you.</p>

<p>For <strong>Home Assistant Core</strong> users, the closest alternative is Home Assistant Container, which is most commonly used with Docker. If you can dedicate a device exclusively to Home Assistant, the recommended installation method is Home Assistant OS, which gives an appliance-like setup.</p>
<p>For <strong>Home Assistant Supervised</strong> users, we recommend migrating to Home Assistant OS‚Äîit supports everything Supervised does, including add-ons. If you want more control over the OS, you can also run Home Assistant OS in a virtual machine, like with Proxmox, or go the Home Assistant Container path alternatively.</p>
<p>For <strong>deprecated architectures</strong>, there is generally no supported migration path using your existing hardware. You will therefore need to find alternative hardware compatible with Home Assistant OS or Container. Second-hand single-board computers and recycled small-form-factor office machines are affordable and sustainable options. In some cases, your system may be running a 32-bit operating system, but is capable of running a 64-bit one (Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 are examples of systems often running a 32-bit OS despite being capable of running 64-bit). In this case, you will need to install a 64-bit capable operating system and restore Home Assistant on that system.</p>
<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><strong>If Home Assistant Core is used for development, and part of the developer docs, why not just offer it to end-users?</strong></em><br />
This is not just about technical viability, it is also about helping and supporting people with their issues, problems, and questions, in our forums and chat. Having these options available to less technical people leads to support queries, and if they have a bad first experience that reflects poorly on the project. Users are free to continue running their systems the way they would like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>No support for Core or Supervised‚Äîcan I still use them?</strong></em><br />
You can still use them even if we no longer support them. There are many users running Home Assistant in all kinds of unofficial ways. This change just means we are removing it from our end-user documentation and will no longer recommend using these installation methods from an official standpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Will the developer documentation on these things remain?</strong></em><br />
Yes, those will remain. The developer documentation for running Home Assistant‚Äôs Core Python application directly in a Python virtual environment will remain. This is how we develop. This proposal is about removing end-user documentation and support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Can I start maintaining these installation methods?</strong></em><br />
While maintaining these methods will require effort, the community is free to move documentation and code to new independent projects. Our maintainers will no longer accept issues or provide end-user documentation, but that shouldn‚Äôt stop anyone passionate about them from continuing to run them, or helping others to do the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Can I reproduce any of the installations you offer?</strong></em><br />
Yes, of course! All our pipelines are open source and transparent, you can always recreate any of our pipelines and release artifacts; either automated or manual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Is this the first step towards making Home Assistant closed source/proprietary/commercial?</strong></em><br />
No, that is impossible. Home Assistant will always remain open source. Home Assistant is owned by the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, a Swiss non-profit foundation that is audited and governed, and‚Äîby law‚Äîbound by its mission. This means it will always be open source and cannot be bought or sold.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been a year since we launched <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/">our first roadmap</a> for Home Assistant, which means it‚Äôs time to launch this year‚Äôs first update! In 2025, we‚Äôre building on our direction to make Home Assistant easier to use for everyone in your household, and taking it to the next level by making smart homes more intuitive, proactive, and user-friendly. üöÄ</p>
<p>This centers on helping Home Assistant understand devices in their context, and cataloging every device that works with Home Assistant through a new project, Device Database. And we will do this the Home Assistant way ‚Äî through the power of our community and our collective intelligence. (‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs not all! The roadmap also covers many product areas we are aiming to work on from automation to voice to dashboard <a href="#and-thats-not-all-for-this-year">and more</a>!)</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre new to our roadmaps or curious about how they guide the development of Home Assistant, be sure to check out <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-introduction/">our introduction</a> to Home Assistant roadmaps. As always, your feedback is incredibly valuable, so please give us your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<h2>One year on the road</h2>
<p>Last year, we introduced <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/">our very first roadmap</a>‚Äîand it wasn‚Äôt just plans on paper. It marked a new chapter for Home Assistant: one where we made our direction clear, set ambitious goals, and invited the whole community along for the ride.</p>
<p>In <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/">2024</a>, we focused on building a smart home that has a high Home Approval Factor: helping both the maintainer and residents of the smart home unlock more value from Home Assistant without needing to be an expert. This was done by improving the touchpoints that all members of the household will interact with, such as automations, dashboards, and voice interactions, while maintaining the power and depth of the platform for our power users and admins.</p>
<p>The real challenge lay in building a roadmap from scratch. That meant not only poring through and prioritizing every single feature request, but also increasing transparency and building trust in the roadmap within our organization and our community as a beacon that can help guide the development of the project. Thanks to the feedback, energy, and contributions from our global community, we‚Äôve made huge strides. In the past year, we tackled some of the biggest pain points, such as drag-and-drop dashboard improvements, automation grouping, standard voice assistant hardware, better automated backups, and more.</p>
<p>Now, in 2025, we are ready to lay the groundwork for the next big step forward: Making Home Assistant <em>truly smart</em> through our collective effort and intelligence.</p>
<h2>The smart home administrator as an inventor</h2>
<p>Home Approval Factor means that a successful smart home isn‚Äôt just great for the person who set it up, but for everyone who lives there. Whether it‚Äôs your partner, kids, or roommates, we want Home Assistant to feel intuitive and supportive for the whole household.</p>
<p>In some ways, being a smart home administrator is like being an inventor (or, as we would say, a product manager). To be a great inventor, you need to understand your users. What are their needs? What solutions can you invent to solve their problems? How do you know you solved their problems? Can you improve upon the solution?</p>
<p>Home Assistant provides all the building blocks for our administrators to build whatever they want and let their imaginations run wild, and better yet, it‚Äôs easier than ever with the improvements we made last year! However, that‚Äôs also the curse of a blank slate. Inventing fun and hyper-personalized solutions for niche problems is a major appeal of Home Assistant, but sometimes, maintenance of a smart home can be a chore ‚Äî not every single problem requires reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p>The reality today is that, according to our <a href="/blog/2025/04/16/state-of-the-open-home-recap/#research">community survey</a>, just 46% of partners and only 27% of children of long-time Home Assistant users are directly interacting with Home Assistant. That‚Äôs a big gap, and it highlights a broader challenge: Even the most experienced smart home administrators don‚Äôt always have the complete picture of their household‚Äôs needs. They may not realize what would help until something goes wrong. And it‚Äôs unreasonable to expect everyone to be an expert in everything ‚Äî from automations to dashboards to onboarding new users.</p>
<h2>From shared wisdom to collective intelligence</h2>
<p class='img'><img alt="wisdom spread across social, chats, and videos" src="/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/shared-wisdom.jpg"/></p>
<p>Right now, if a smart home admin wants to improve their setup, they have to go hunting‚Äîthrough our community forums, GitHub repos, Reddit threads, YouTube videos, Discord chats‚Ä¶ you name it‚Äîtrying to find tips and tricks that apply to their specific case. You share incredible wisdom with each other every day, but much of it is scattered, short-lived, or hard to apply without lots of customization.</p>
<p>We believe it‚Äôs time for a smarter system.</p>
<p>What if Home Assistant could learn from our community‚Äôs best ideas and use that knowledge to proactively suggest improvements? What if it could guide users based on what others have done in similar situations? That‚Äôs the vision we‚Äôre working toward: using collective intelligence to power a truly smart home.</p>
<p class='img'><img alt="organized shared wisdom is collective intelligence" src="/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/collective-intelligence.jpg"/></p>
<p>To get there, Home Assistant needs to <em>understand</em> what‚Äôs in the home. Inside each home, there are the people, the spaces, and the devices. This year, we will start with helping Home Assistant understand devices in terms of (1) <strong>context</strong>: what each device is and how it is used, and (2) <strong>information</strong>: every device that works with Home Assistant and how it is supported.</p>
<h2>Putting Devices in Context</h2>
<p>Today, most devices in Home Assistant show up as a bundle of entities: a temperature sensor here, a switch there. This is by design ‚Äî we want to provide the ultimate flexibility in configuring your system, and will continue to do so. However, it is not without disadvantages.</p>
<p class='img'><img alt="Fridge as a series of entities" src="/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/devices-without-context.jpg"/></p>
<p>For example, we don‚Äôt always know that those entities together form, say, a fridge, which is essentially a mini house of its own: It may have temperature sensors, a door sensor, a light, and so on, but Home Assistant cannot assume them as any other sensors or lights within a room. Without that context, Home Assistant can‚Äôt do much beyond letting users build their own dashboards and automations from scratch.</p>
<p>As you add more devices, entities pile up, and Home Assistant starts to lose the thread of what‚Äôs actually in the home. Your smart home should become more powerful as you add more devices, but at the cost of the difficulty of maintaining them also increasing exponentially.</p>
<p>When we <strong>put devices in context</strong>, everything changes. A fridge becomes more than a list of entities ‚Äî it becomes an actual device that can have a dedicated dashboard, default automations, and contextual voice commands.</p>
<p class='img'><img alt="Dashboards, Automation and Voice in context" src="/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/device-context.jpg"/></p>
<p>Here‚Äôs how context unlocks a more streamlined experience across the platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voice:</strong> Assist can currently source the right sensor if it knows the area of the device. In the future, we can also intelligently exclude irrelevant sensors from a voice query. For example, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the temperature in the kitchen?‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt return the freezer‚Äôs internal temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Dashboards:</strong> Integrations can provide customized cards and dashboards right from the start, providing a much more streamlined experience. For example, we can provide a fridge dashboard. It works with other devices, too. Imagine a car dashboard or a 3D printer dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Automations:</strong> By understanding what devices a user has and how they are commonly used, we can intelligently suggest automations created by our community. For example, ‚Äúfridge door left open‚Äù or ‚Äúfridge water leakage‚Äù alerts can be provided without building them manually from scratch.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be a core architectural change that will be proposed and discussed in the coming months. We‚Äôre building on what our contributors already share in integrations: knowledge about how devices are structured and how they should behave. My hope is that this will provide the framework for our contributors to contribute dashboards and automation blueprints to our code in exciting new ways.</p>
<h2>Introducing the Device Database</h2>
<p>To make all this work, we also need a centralized, structured place to store and share device knowledge. That‚Äôs where the Device Database‚Äîa brand new project from the Open Home Foundation‚Äîcomes in.</p>
<p>Think of it as a source of truth created, curated, and validated by the community. A place where we gather everything from metadata (like power usage or infrared codes) to factual information (setup instructions such as how to add or reset a device) to real-world setup insights and community creations (such as automation examples). It will contain information users intentionally submit to the database, nothing will be collected automatically without your explicit consent.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs more than just having all device documentation in one place. We want to universalize all our collective experiences about devices in one place, which is more accessible, centralized, and structured than online websites and chat rooms.</p>
<p>With the Device Database, users both old and new can easily make well-informed choices and pick the best Home Assistant-compatible devices for them based on real usage experiences, allowing them to easily make decisions based on open home values ‚Äî privacy, choice, and sustainability.</p>
<p>The data will be used and cross-referenced in Home Assistant and other Open Home Foundation projects, and acts as the backbone of their integrations. For example, a future infrared integration can hypothetically benefit from having access to readily available infrared codes from the database.</p>
<p class='img'><img alt="Protocols, device database, feeding choice" src="/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/working-together.png"/></p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt something we can build alone. We‚Äôre relying on the strength of our global community to turn this vision into reality, and we‚Äôre backing it up with our infrastructure, engineering efforts, and partnerships:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a> is here to provide the framework to help us collect and collaborate on knowledge easily and safely.</li>
<li>We‚Äôre working with <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/">Nabu Casa</a>‚Äîour commercial partner‚Äîto create the most reliable hardware antennas that support more open protocols, such as Z-Wave, Zigbee, Bluetooth, and more, to expand the Home Assistant ecosystem.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://works-with.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant program</a> is being strengthened to make it easier to find trusted, high-quality devices for the platform, as you may have witnessed with the <a href="/blog/categories/works-with-home-assistant/">numerous new partners</a> joining in the past few months.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result? A system where no admin has to figure everything out in isolation on their own. Home Assistant can suggest, guide, adapt, and point users in the right direction, by drawing from the collective intelligence of the community (instead of scraping user data involuntarily like what Big Tech does).</p>
<h2>And that‚Äôs not all for this year!</h2>
<p class='img'><img alt="Devices, Automations, Dashboards, Voice & Music, Frontend" src="/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/roadmap-2025.png"/></p>
<p>While device context and the Device Database are the major themes of this year‚Äôs roadmap, it doesn‚Äôt mean that we are dropping everything else that does not fit. We‚Äôre continuing work on other parts of the product experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>A complete revamp of our automation triggers and conditions to make them both easier to use and more powerful.</li>
<li>A navigation and design system overhaul to improve feature discovery.</li>
<li>Continued improvements to make dashboards easier to use out of the box, including a new default dashboard and more.</li>
<li>Enhanced privacy controls for users, guests, and public access (Yes, I am aware of that.)</li>
<li>Easier setup for Music Assistant.</li>
<li>Make Assist more conversational, such as the ability to confirm and clarify a query.</li>
<li>Continued explorations in using LLMs to improve the overall user experience beyond voice.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the meantime, we are working on making our roadmap more publicly accessible, so that you can discuss and track our progress with us! Stay tuned.</p>
<h2>Laying the Groundwork for a Truly Smart Home</h2>
<p>This roadmap isn‚Äôt about the flashy latest tech fad (what is it now anyway?) or abstract features. It‚Äôs about creating the enduring foundation to allow our community to build something greater than all of us together: a smart home platform that learns, grows, and adapts ‚Äî with full respect for privacy, choice, and sustainability.</p>
<p>The central theme of the roadmap is that making Home Assistant smarter starts with understanding context, such as knowing what devices are and how they‚Äôre used, and we will use this collective intelligence to supercharge the main pillars of the user experience ‚Äî automations, voice, and dashboards.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre making maintenance of a smart home easier, by making it less like a mandatory chore while still keeping the fun of tinkering (say, you wanna go wild on YAML), and by creating tools to help admins solve problems they don‚Äôt even know they have yet. We believe that, as our advanced users continue to tinker with their systems, their creations and discoveries will also benefit and elevate every user‚Äôs smart home.</p>
<p>We can‚Äôt wait to work on these initiatives for the rest of this year! Let‚Äôs build it together! üöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèº‚ÄçüöÄüë®üèº‚ÄçüöÄ</p>

<p>Home Assistant 2025.5! üéâ</p>
<p>It‚Äôs time for the May release, and we have a lot to talk about! But before
we do, I want to quickly touch on things that happened in the last month that
you might have missed‚Ä¶</p>
<p>We recently hosted our State of the Open Home event‚Äîa <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4Vctz1_KYE">live streamed show</a>
where we discussed the current state and future vision of the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>
and its projects, including Home Assistant. During this event, we not only
revealed our roadmap for the upcoming year but also celebrated a tremendous
milestone:</p>
<p><strong>2,000,000 active installations</strong> of Home Assistant worldwide! üéâ</p>
<p><a href="/blog/2025/04/16/state-of-the-open-home-recap/">Read more about the State of the Open Home in this summarized blog post</a></p>
<p>A community of 2 million households is something to celebrate! And we are
doing that by gathering together in person on <strong><a href="https://lu.ma/haday2025">Home Assistant Community Day</a></strong>
on <strong>May 24th 2025</strong>; over <strong>fifty!</strong> meetups are being organized <strong>all around the
world!</strong> Want to learn more? Join a meetup? Or even host one?</p>
<p><a href="/blog/2025/04/24/community-day/">Check out the Home Assistant Community Day 2025 blog post</a> for more information!</p>
<p>Ok, the May release, really, I love this one! It is filled to the brim with
quality of life improvements that I‚Äôm sure you will love. ü•∞</p>
<p>The quest for a great backup system is continuing this release, shipping
quite the list of improvements, most notably the ability to set a retention
policy per backup location! <a href="https://nabucasa.com">Nabu Casa</a> throws in a
whole bunch of new text-to-speech voice variants üó£Ô∏è <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/config/tts/">included in your Home Assistant Cloud subscription</a>,
allowing your announcements to sound, for example, sad or happy!</p>
<p>But‚Ä¶ there is more! Z-Wave gets Long Range support üì∂, you can now copy and
paste YAML automation snippets directly in our automation UI, a new tool to monitor the device discovery process in Home Assistant, and‚Äìmy personal
favorite‚Äìthe improved experience when you pick an entity anywhere in the UI. ü§©</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>

<h2>Another iteration of the backup system</h2>
<p>In our <a href="/blog/2025/01/03/release-20251/#overhaul-of-the-backup-system">January release</a>,
we did the first overhaul of the backup system. In the <a href="/blog/2025/02/05/release-20252/#iterating-on-backups">February release</a>,
we did an iteration based on your feedback. In this release, we dedicated even more
time to iterate and improve backups even further.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs dive in!</p>
<h3>Per location backup retention policy settings</h3>
<p>This release adds a much-requested feature: the ability to set a backup retention
policy per location. This is particularly useful if you have multiple backup
locations configured in Home Assistant.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup retention policy settings for the Microsoft OneDrive integration." src="/images/blog/2025-05/backups-retention-per-location.png" />
<p>It might be that one of your backup locations has more storage space than
another, or that you want to keep more backups in one location than another.
For example, maybe you have space to store the last 3 backups in your Google
Drive, but you want to keep 25 backups on your local NAS server.</p>
<h3>Backup before upgrading the Home Assistant Operating System</h3>
<p>Updating the Home Assistant Operating System is as easy as clicking a button. And while the upgrade process has
a fallback mechanism in case the upgrade process fails, it is always a good
idea to have a recent backup in multiple locations before you start the upgrade process.</p>
<p>To help you with that, the update dialog for the Home Assistant Operating System
now includes the option to create a backup before starting the upgrade process. Selecting this will create a backup that follows the same settings as your automatic backups (and if you don‚Äôt have that configured yet, it will just backup your settings, history, and add-ons), uploading this to all enabled backup locations before starting the upgrade process.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the Home Assistant Operating System update dialog, which has a new toggle that asks you if you want to backup before upgrading." src="/images/blog/2025-05/backup-before-upgrade-home-assistant-operating-system.png" />
<p>This way, you can be sure that you have a backup of your system before
upgrading, even if something goes wrong beyond the safeguards of the
operating system upgrade.</p>
<h3>Set the default backup preference for upgrades</h3>
<p>The above option to backup before upgrade is great, but the feedback on the
toggle to create a backup before upgrade is mixed. Some of you prefer to always
backup before upgrading, while others rely on their scheduled backups and don‚Äôt
want to be bothered with the backup process whenever they upgrade a part
of Home Assistant.</p>
<p>To please both groups, we have added a new setting to the backup settings page
to set the default behavior for the backup before upgrade toggle.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup before upgrade toggle preference in the backup settings." src="/images/blog/2025-05/backups-select-preference-backup-before-update.png" />
<p>When you set the option to ‚ÄúBackup before upgrade‚Äù, the toggle will be enabled
by default, otherwise it will default to disabled. There is an additional
option to set this behavior for add-ons as well, so you can tweak it to your
liking.</p>
<h3>Waiting for the backup to finish on restarts</h3>
<p>Another small but important improvement is that if you initiate a restart of Home Assistant while a backup is in progress, your system will wait for the backup to finish before restarting.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing Home Assistant waiting for backup to finish before restarting." src="/images/blog/2025-05/backups-prevents-restart-when-in-progress.png" />
<p>This prevents the unintended situation where a backup is in progress, and you
abort the process by restarting Home Assistant.</p>
<h2>Lots of new text-to-speech voice variants for Home Assistant Cloud subscribers</h2>
<p>If you are subscribed to <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com">Home Assistant Cloud</a>, you
not only get <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/config/backups/">backup storage included</a>,
but you also get access to the most speedy, super accurate <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/config/tts/">text-to-speech</a>
available. If you haven‚Äôt tried it yet, now is the perfect time to sign up for the 30-day trial!</p>
<p>This release extends the already staggering number of text-to-speech voices,
but also now includes voice variants and styles. This means that you can
now choose between different voice styles and tones, such as ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù,
‚Äúangry‚Äù, ‚Äúsad‚Äù, ‚Äúwhisper‚Äù, etc., allowing you to customize your announcements to
fit the mood and context of the situation.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing a glimpse of the new voice variants for available for Home Assistant Cloud subscribers." src="/images/blog/2025-05/new-voice-variants-for-home-assistant-cloud.png" />

<h2>Picking entities</h2>
<p>We are working on improving the context of things shown in the UI. This is to
ensure you always know which device or entity you are looking at, no matter
where you are in the Home Assistant interface.</p>
<p>In the last release, we already had a small noteworthy change regarding this.
We added the device and area to the entity information dialogs, so you always
know exactly which entity you are viewing.</p>
<p>In this release, we have improved the context provided within the entity pickers in our UI. This is the dropdown you see when you select an entity in, for example, a card, automation,
or script. This picker will now show the device and area name as well!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the new entity pickers, providing more context and improves search capabilities." src="/images/blog/2025-05/improved-entity-picker.png" />
<p>This enhancement gradually eliminates the need for you to manually rename
entities or devices to include location information‚Äîgiving you a much better
out-of-the-box experience with less setup work.</p>
<p>Not only has the visual appearance of the picker improved, but the search
functionality has been completely overhauled too! üîé Finding the exact entity
you‚Äôre looking for is now significantly easier thanks to a smarter search
algorithm and the addition of more contextual information in the matching
process.</p>
<div class="alert alert-tip">
  <p class="alert-title"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:lightbulb-outline'></iconify-icon> Tip</p>
  <div class="alert-content">
<p><strong>You might notice that the entity ID isn‚Äôt shown in the picker anymore!</strong></p>
<p>We think we are at a point where you may solely rely on the UI and the
entity ID is not needed anymore. However, if you <strong>do prefer</strong> to see the
entity ID in this drop down, <strong>you can enable it</strong> in your profile settings.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the improved entity picker with the show entity ID in entity picker option enabled in my user profile." src="/images/blog/2025-05/improved-entity-picker-with-entity-ids.png" />
<p>To do so, select your profile picture in the bottom left corner of the
Home Assistant UI, and under <strong><a href='https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/profile' class='my' target='_blank'>User settings</a></strong> enable
the <strong>Display entity IDs in picker</strong> option.</p>

<h2>Z-Wave Long Range support and improved Smart Start</h2>
<p>We are providing quite a few enhancements to the Z-Wave integration and
experience in this release. Our commercial partner <a href="https://nabucasa.com">Nabu Casa</a>
is working on a not-so-secret Z-Wave antenna, and we want to ensure that
Home Assistant is ready for it by providing the best user experience
possible.</p>
<p>This release, we improved the whole experience in setting up new Z-Wave devices,
including improved support for setting up new Z-Wave devices by scanning the
Smart Start QR code.</p>
<p>Z-Wave Smart Start QR scanning now works natively in our <a href="https://companion.home-assistant.io/">mobile companion apps</a>,
removing browser limitations. Added devices are immediately visible in
Home Assistant, even if the device is not yet powered on. Once powered on or rebooted, the
device will automatically be added to your Z-Wave network.</p>
<p>The most exciting part of this release is the addition of Z-Wave Long Range
support. This is a new Z-Wave technology that allows devices to communicate
over much longer distances than traditional Z-Wave devices. This is especially
useful if you have a specific device that needs to be placed far away,
for example, a contact sensor on a gate or mailbox up your driveway.</p>
<p class='img'>
<img alt="Screenshot showing adding a Z-Wave device with Long Range support." src="/images/blog/2025-05/zwave-long-range.png" />
You can choose if you want to add the Z-Wave device to the existing mesh network
or connect it directly using Long Range.
</p>
<p>After scanning the QR code of a Long Range capable device, you will get the
option to either add it to the existing mesh network or connect it directly
using Long Range. Both have pros and cons, mesh networking is recommended for
most devices, but if you have a device that needs to be placed far away,
Long Range might be the better option.</p>
<h2>Integrations</h2>

<h3>Integration quality scale achievements</h3>
<p>One thing we are incredibly proud of in Home Assistant is our
<a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/quality_scale/">integration quality scale</a>. This scale helps us and our contributors to ensure
integrations are of high quality, maintainable, and provide the best possible
user experience.</p>
<p>This release, we celebrate several <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> that have improved
their quality scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>4 integrations reached platinum</strong> üèÜ</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/integrations/ohme">Ohme</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dan-r">@dan-r</a></li>
<li><a href="/integrations/vodafone_station">Vodafone Station</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/chemelli74">@chemelli74</a></li>

</ul>
<p>This is a huge achievement for these integrations and their maintainers. The
effort and dedication required to reach these quality levels is significant,
as it involves extensive testing, documentation, error handling, and often
complete rewrites of parts of the integration.</p>
<p>A big thank you to all the contributors involved! üëè</p>
<h3>Now available to set up from the UI</h3>
<p>While most <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.</p>
<p>The following integration is now available via the Home Assistant UI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/stiebel_eltron">STIEBEL ELTRON</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/ThyMYthOS">@ThyMYthOS</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Farewell to the following</h3>
<p>The following <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> are also no longer available as
of this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oncue by Kohler</strong> has been removed because the app by Kohler has been
discontinued.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you know Home Assistant actually has keyboard shortcuts for all kinds of
things? No? Well‚Ä¶ if you are curious to learn, after upgrading, press
<code>?</code> anywhere in the UI to see a list of all available keyboard shortcuts.
Nice addition <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a>!</li>
<li>Support for the <a href="/integrations/matter">Matter</a> 1.4 water heater device type has been added.
Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/lboue">@lboue</a>!</li>
<li>When setting up a new device in Home Assistant, you can now directly name
it during the setup process. Nice! Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/bramkragten">@bramkragten</a>!</li>
<li>Media players now have an action to search using the <code>media_player.search_media</code>
action. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/zweckj">@zweckj</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/piitaya">@piitaya</a> added a <code>device_name</code> template function to get the name of a device
in Home Assistant. Cool!</li>
<li>The <code>floor_id</code> and <code>area_id</code> template methods have been enhanced by <a href="https://github.com/formatBCE">@formatBCE</a>
to also look for floors or area aliases. Awesome!</li>
<li>We now have support for trigger-based <a href="/integrations/template/">template entities</a> for switches and
lights. Amazing work <a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a>!</li>
<li>Support for modern YAML-syntax was also added to the cover <a href="/integrations/template/">template entities</a>
by <a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a>. Nice!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/frenck">@frenck</a> added support for detecting Home Assistant Container installation
types not running in host networking mode. This is important for
Home Assistant to function properly. It raises a repair issue if it detects
this.</li>
<li>A long-standing issue with iOS and the dropdown items in our user interface
has been fixed! No longer will it select the wrong item when you tap on it
while the dropdown is open and the keyboard is shown.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Badges on the dashboard can now be wrapped or scrolled</h2>
<p>A cool little new feature for dashboards landed this release, which we don‚Äôt
want to rush past unnoticed. The behavior of the badges in the header of a
dashboard view can now be configured to either wrap or scroll.</p>
<p>Wrap was the original and is still the default behavior, but if you have a lot
of badges and primarily use a mobile device, scrolling might be a better option
for you.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the behavior options for the badges shown in the header of a dashboard view: Either scroll or wrap." src="/images/blog/2025-05/dashboards-header-badges-behavior.png" />
<h2>Improved UI experience when using templates in automations &amp; scripts</h2>
<p>If you are a power-user, using templates in your automations and script, you
are probably familiar with the fact that the UI falls back to using YAML for
any action block that contains a template.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a> to the rescue! He has worked on a solution to improve this
experience.</p>
<p>So, instead of falling back to pure YAML for the whole block, it now only
falls back to a code editor for fields containing an action template. This
means the rest of the UI‚Äîfor all other action fields‚Äîremains intact and you
can still use the UI to edit the rest.</p>
<p>As you can see in this screenshot below, the brightness is set using a template,
which is no problem, as the rest of the action is still editable in the UI.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the automation improvements made, when using templates keeping the rest of the UI available in those cases." src="/images/blog/2025-05/template-automation-improvement.png" />
<p>This is a great improvement for power users, as it allows you to use the UI
for most of the automation or script, while still being able to use templates
where needed. It also makes it easier to understand the automation or script,
as you can see the context of the template in the UI.</p>
<p>Great improvement there <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a>! üôå</p>
<h2>Pasting automations and scripts YAML directly into the UI</h2>
<p>Found this great automation or script example in our documentation or the
<a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/">community forums</a>, but it is shared in
YAML format? No problem! You can now paste the YAML directly into the UI.</p>
<p>When you are editing an automation, you can now simply paste the YAML directly
into the UI editor and it will be converted to the UI format. This is regardless of
whether the pasted example is a full-blown automation or just a single trigger,
condition, or action.</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="RRl-G3Igo4E" videotitle="Copy & paste YAML directly into the UI!"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>An amazing quality of life improvement, contributed by <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a>! Thank you! üôå</p>
<h2>Discover what Home Assistant is discovering</h2>
<p>Home Assistant is constantly scanning your network for new devices and
integrations using all sorts of discovery protocols. This greatly improves your
experience, as it allows you to easily add new devices to your Home
Assistant installation.</p>
<p>However, sometimes, you might want to know what Home Assistant is seeing
or wonder why a certain device is not being discovered. To help with that
<a href="https://github.com/bdraco">@bdraco</a> added browsing tools for the DHCP, mDNS/ZeroConf, and UPnP/SSDP that
allow you to see what Home Assistant is seeing. It is quite technical, but
it is a great way to see what is going on in your network.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new ZeroConf/mDNS browser, showing the internal the discovery process of Home Assistant." src="/images/blog/2025-05/discovery-browsers.png" />
<p>You can find these new tools in <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Network</strong>. At the
bottom of that page, you will find the ability to browse all the things
Home Assistant is seeing on your network for each of the discovery protocols.</p>
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.5 in May.
These patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch
release every Friday.</p>

<p>In this release, we‚Äôve made foundational updates to our theming system, which
include <strong>backwards incompatible changes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Polymer Components Removed</strong>: Legacy Polymer-based components have been
fully removed. As a result, all related <code>paper-*</code> CSS variables have also
been removed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some variables have been <strong>migrated to new theme tokens</strong>.</li>
<li>Others were outdated and have been <strong>removed entirely</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New Typography Variables</strong>: We‚Äôve introduced a new set of
<strong>typography CSS variables</strong> to lay the groundwork for a more consistent
and modern UI.</p>
<ul>
<li>These are part of an ongoing refactor and are <strong>not yet in use everywhere</strong>.
More adoption will follow in future releases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you‚Äôre maintaining custom cards or themes, <strong>please update any usage of the
following variables</strong> accordingly.</p>

    <updated>2025-04-29T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/04/29/eve-joins-works-with-home-assistant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-04-eve/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Eve and Home Assistant collaboration banner">
<p>We‚Äôre thrilled to announce that <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en">Eve</a> has joined the <a href="https://works-with.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant</a> program! Eve is at the forefront of the Matter standard and has some great Matter devices focused on local control and privacy in the home. They‚Äôre bringing a variety of devices to the program, including a couple of firsts!</p>
<h2>Eve of a New Day for the Open Home</h2>
<p>Eve, based in Germany and part of ABB, is known for making high-quality smart home devices. They‚Äôve been an early proponent of Matter, as it really aligns with their philosophy of local and private control. In their own words, <em>‚ÄúNo Eve cloud, no registration and no tracking so your data won‚Äôt get exposed. Local intelligence and direct communication between Eve devices and smartphones or hubs without cloud dependency.‚Äù</em><!--more--></p>
<p>Eve has had a wide range of devices Works with Home Assistant certified, all of which connect directly to Home Assistant via Matter. If you‚Äôre not aware, Matter is an open smart home standard that allows for local control by directly connecting devices to Home Assistant, keeping your smart home data in your home. In case you missed it, Home Assistant is now <a href="/blog/2025/03/10/matter-certification/">Matter Certified</a>!</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-eve/eve-weather.jpg' alt="Eve Weather"/>Built for outdoor weather sensing, Matter, and a cool segmented LCD display---sign me up</p>
<p>Matter can connect to devices over Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks, but it can also use <a href="/integrations/thread/">Thread</a>, which every Eve device being certified today uses. Thread devices can be directly connected to Home Assistant using a device like the <a href="/connectzbt1">Connect ZBT-1</a>, or can be connected to Home Assistant via an existing hub (Thread Border Router) you may already have from another <a href="/integrations/thread#google">smart home ecosystem</a>. Thread was designed around efficiency and is excellent for low-powered or battery-powered devices. Also, if your smart home balloons up to a hundred devices (or more üòÖ), you won‚Äôt overwhelm your Wi-Fi router, as Thread operates independently.</p>
<p>Eve isn‚Äôt just a fan of Matter; they‚Äôre actively shaping the standard. Their team is deeply involved with the development of Matter and the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA), and we were delighted to connect with them at the recent CSA meeting in Chicago. Their commitment runs so deep that Eve licenses its technology to help other manufacturers embrace Matter. In fact, fellow Works with Home Assistant partner <a href="/blog/2025/03/27/motionblinds-joins-wwha/">Motionblinds</a> uses Eve‚Äôs technology, proudly displaying ‚ÄúPowered by Eve‚Äù on their certified motors.</p>
<div class="alert">
    <p>"Eve and Home Assistant are the perfect match for a local-first, privacy-centric smart home. With Eve devices featuring Matter, Thread, and absolutely no cloud connection in combination with Home Assistant's extensive, local automation capabilities, now everybody can enjoy the smart home the way it was meant to be: with you in control."¬†<em style="text-align: right; display: block;">-Jerome Gackel, CEO Eve Systems</em>
</div>
<h2>Certified Devices</h2>
<p>In case you didn‚Äôt know, Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box with Home Assistant. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, and the support of <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers funds this work.</p>
<p>Eve has certified the following Matter-over-Thread enabled devices:</p>

<h2>Eve-rything You Need</h2>
<p>It is amazing to have Eve in the Works with Home Assistant program, as we‚Äôve been fans of their focus on privacy and local control for years. The list of devices they certified today is really comprehensive, and I dare say you could build a pretty well-rounded smart home just with their devices. There are even a couple of firsts for the program, including their smart radiator valve, outdoor weather sensor, outdoor outlet, and water-resistant motion sensor. Eve is continuously working on transitioning their complete smart home portfolio over to Matter, so if you spot a device that is not Matter-compatible yet - stay tuned.</p>
<h3>FAQ on Works with Home Assistant</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><strong>If I have a device that is not listed under ‚ÄòWorks with Home Assistant‚Äô does this mean it‚Äôs not supported?</strong></em> No! It just means that it hasn‚Äôt yet gone through testing with our team, either because the brand has not submitted it for testing, or because the device does not fit the program‚Äôs requirements (ex. it‚Äôs not an end-device or requires cloud connectivity). It may not be the same polished experience you would get from certified devices, but if you‚Äôve been using the device for some time without issue, nothing will change. Our community is quite good at listing the devices they have confirmed to work on the integration page, so this is always worth double-checking if you‚Äôre unsure. We may test it down the road, but it‚Äôs up to the brand to choose what they submit for testing, so tell them what you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Ok, so what‚Äôs the point of the Works with program?</strong></em> It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that the devices must have full functionality within Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud connectivity, and will continue to do so long-term. If you already own one of these devices, congrats! You‚Äôre safe in the knowledge that the manufacturers are committed long-term to providing Home Assistant support.</p>

<p><em><strong>How were these devices tested?</strong></em> All devices in this list were tested using a standard Home Assistant Green, with the Connect ZBT-1 as the radio for the Thread Border Router, and our <a href="/integrations/matter/">certified Matter Integration</a>.¬† If you have a different hardware configuration that works for you, then great. The above hardware is just what our team uses to ensure consistency across testing.</p>

    <link href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/04/24/community-day/"/>
    <updated>2025-04-24T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/04/24/community-day</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-04-community-day/art.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Community Day - May 24th" style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'>
<p>Our first <strong>Home Assistant Community Day</strong> will be on <strong>May 24th</strong> this year üéâ, and with a month to go, here is all the information you need to take part.</p>
<p>The community will be leading meetups across the globe, so find your nearest event and <strong><a href="https://lu.ma/haday2025">register now</a></strong>! They‚Äôre all free and will be full of smart people with smart homes. If you don‚Äôt see your city on this list, we‚Äôre encouraging the community to host their own meetups, so keep reading to learn more.</p>
<h2>Our biggest party yet</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre all wondering, ‚Äú<em>Missy, what is a Community Day?</em>‚Äù. In its simplest form, it‚Äôs a single day in which community members around the world set up local meetups with each other. That leaves a lot open, though. <em>Where do you sign up? How do you host your own meetup? How many people should show up? Where‚Äôs the best place to hold a meetup?</em> ‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a lot of questions! üò≥ Luckily, I have all the answers üòâ.</p>
<!--more-->
<h3>Locations and registering to attend</h3>
<p>To coordinate all these meetups, we are using Luma, a site focused on tech meetups. All the current events can be found below or on our <a href="https://lu.ma/haday2025">Home Assistant Community Day</a> calendar.</p>
<iframe

></iframe>
<p>All Community Day events are free, so <strong><a href="https://lu.ma/haday2025">register before spaces run out!</a></strong> (No worries, there are waitlists!). We also have people who work full-time on Home Assistant attending these events. To find out who you can meet, head over to Luma üòé!</p>
<h3>Host your own</h3>
<p><em><strong>Is your city, country, or continent not on the list</strong></em> ‚ÅâÔ∏è Time to take matters into your own hands, and create your own meetup.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-community-day/event.png' alt="Example event"/>Example event page for our London meetup üíÇ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüá¨üáß</p>
<p>Using Luma, <a href="https://lu.ma/signin">create an account</a>, and navigate to our <a href="https://lu.ma/haday2025">Home Assistant Community Day</a> event page, select <strong>Submit Event &gt; Create New Event</strong> (the button is above the calendar on the right). Don‚Äôt stress if you don‚Äôt have a venue yet‚Äîyou can add it later! So people know you‚Äôre part of the worldwide party, we‚Äôve created an <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1xnAIVvsekX1tmfE60f0qrHOoIFK9Cw_R">invite graphic</a> you can set as the event image. Make sure you follow this checklist when you create your event:</p>
<p>‚úÖ <strong>Event Name</strong> = ‚Äú(city name) meetup‚Äù<br />
‚úÖ <strong>Time zone</strong> = your local time<br />
‚úÖ <strong>Date</strong> = Saturday, May 24<br />
‚úÖ <strong>Time</strong> = your choosing! (4 hours max)<br />
‚úÖ <strong>Add Event Location</strong> = your city (or venue once you have one)<br />
‚úÖ <strong>Capacity</strong> = 50 max (less if the venue is smaller), and toggle the Waitlist on<br />
‚úÖ <strong>Hosts</strong> = Add me (Missy Quarry - <a href="mailto:missy.quarry@openhomefoundation.org">missy.quarry@openhomefoundation.org</a>) as a host of the event so I can make sure it appears in the main event calendar</p>
<p>Click <strong>Create Event</strong> once you‚Äôve followed that checklist, then come let everyone know in the Home Assistant Community Day <a href="https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/1364989531069091920">meetup thread on Discord</a> or the <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/social/">Social section of the Community forum</a>! üéâ</p>
<p><em><strong>Capacity:</strong></em> If you‚Äôre wondering why we capped the capacity at 50, this is mostly to ensure that hosts don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed with finding a venue big enough. Also, that‚Äôs the average number of attendees who have registered for the last couple of events. You may have more people who want to attend your event - that‚Äôs where the waitlist comes in handy. üëèüèª</p>
<p><em><strong>Location:</strong></em> This will depend on the host, but we highly encourage hosts to check out local venues like cafes, community spaces, or bars. Please make sure the venue agrees to you hosting the event there and that it‚Äôs an accommodating and welcoming place for everyone in our community. Consider accessibility and the facilities required for large groups (access to transport, food, drink, and washrooms)‚Äîthis is also why we ask that people not host at their homes. Feel free to consider other public spaces, for instance, I pulled some strings at Microsoft for a cool space on campus to host the <a href="https://lu.ma/qb0hhhkm">Redmond meetup</a>. Just remember, the venue fees are up to the host to pay.</p>
<p><em><strong>What to provide/organize:</strong></em> These are free events, and hosts are not obligated to provide anything but good conversation. Keep it simple‚Äîthis is just a chance for people to meet and chat.</p>
<p><em><strong>Keep attendees informed:</strong></em> ¬†You can always talk it out with your registered attendees via Luma‚Äîhosts will have the ability to ‚Äú<em>Send a Blast</em>‚Äù out to their attendees. Also, the Community Day thread on Discord will be a great way to hook up with attendees on that platform. We‚Äôll promote these events on the Home Assistant socials, to ensure we reach the whole community.</p>
<p><em><strong>Clashes:</strong></em> ¬†If two or more events are requested in the same city, we‚Äôll link up hosts so they can organize things together.</p>
<p><em><strong>Have more questions for me?</strong></em> Send me a message on Discord (<a href="https://discord.com/users/303933403303247872">@adorablecyborg</a>) or <a href="mailto:missy@openhomefoundation.org?subject=Community%20Day%202025">email</a>‚Äî I‚Äôm absolutely happy to help you out where I can! üòå</p>
<h2>See you soon</h2>
<p>Our team has been meeting the community all over the world, and y‚Äôall never cease to amaze me. People are doing really cool stuff with Home Assistant, and you‚Äôll leave meetups with new automation ideas, cool DIY plans, and maybe even some new friends. Honestly, if you‚Äôre like me, every one of my family members are sick of hearing about my smart home, it‚Äôs time to meet some people who only want to talk about that! ü§ù</p>
<p>If you can‚Äôt make it on  May 24th, don‚Äôt fret‚Äîthere‚Äôll be a Community Day next year! Although Community Day will be special, you can always get on the Home Assistant community <a href="https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/1325926382575816725">meetup channel</a> in Discord or the <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/social/">Social section of the forum</a> to set up group meetups throughout the year. üòä</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt wait to see all the events added and how many people register for these meetups! ü§© I‚Äôll share more information as the day approaches, including how you can share your meetup photo üì∏, which we‚Äôll feature on our channels. See you on the socials!</p>

    <link href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/04/17/reolink-joins-works-with-home-assistant/"/>
    <updated>2025-04-17T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/04/17/reolink-joins-works-with-home-assistant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-04-reolink/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Reolink + Works with Home Assistant" style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'>
<p>We‚Äôre excited to announce that <a href="https://reolink.com/">Reolink</a> is the latest partner to join the <a href="https://works-with.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant</a> program.</p>
<p>Just recently, we had <a href="/blog/2025/03/27/motionblinds-joins-wwha/">blinds join the program</a>, and now we have Reolink bringing the first certified cameras and doorbells. Reolink has certified a wide range of their devices including battery-powered and wired options, as well as devices with Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) and Wi-Fi connectivity.</p>
<p>When someone in the Home Assistant community asks for camera recommendations, Reolink often tops the list. This strong reputation is well-earned, as they prioritize local control, don‚Äôt require cloud connectivity for their advanced features, and support open protocols whenever possible.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Seeing eye-to-eye</h2>
<p>Founded in 2009, Reolink has been building video security solutions for nearly any setup‚Äîwhether you need a monster 10-camera PoE system or just a few Wi-Fi-connected cameras. They‚Äôve done this while closely aligning with the Open Home values of privacy, choice, and sustainability.</p>
<p>First and foremost, they‚Äôve put in great options for maintaining privacy, specifically prioritizing storing video locally, with cloud storage as an optional extra. Files aren‚Äôt locked down‚Äîwired cameras support multiple streaming protocols, while battery models can send clips to an FTP server‚Äîgiving users better choice and control.</p>
<p>While other brands lock features like motion detection behind subscriptions, Reolink devices work fully locally‚Äîeven without internet access, all advertised features will work now and into the future. With support for streaming protocols and fully local use, these cameras are set to work for years, which is a win for the planet üíö.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs amazing that there is a security camera brand that respects the Open Home values while supporting all the latest features‚Äîlike resolutions greater than 4K, long battery life, PoE, solar power, color night vision, advanced motion and object detection.</p>
<h2>Picture perfect integration</h2>
<p>Another reason these cameras get recommended so often is the platinum-quality <a href="/integrations/reolink/">Reolink integration</a>. This ensures user-friendly features like automatic device discovery, smooth setup, firmware updates, and detailed documentation. Critically, <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-platinum">platinum integrations</a> include exceptionally efficient and well-written code, improving overall system stability and reliability.</p>
<p>All Works with Home Assistant-certified devices feature top-quality integrations, but what makes this one special is that it was built by the Home Assistant community. Huge thanks to the Reolink team and <a href="https://github.com/starKillerOG">@StarkillerOG</a> for the effort that brought it to the Platinum level late last year.</p>
<p>Reolink is a big fan of our active and engaged community and joined Works with Home Assistant to continue this close connection to them.</p>
<div class="alert">
    <p>"Reolink is thrilled to join Home Assistant's ecosystem to empower users with smarter, more integrated security solutions. Partnering with Home Assistant allows us to align with a community-driven platform that shares our commitment to innovation and accessibility."</p>
<em style="text-align: right; display: block;">-Fabrice Klohoun, Marketing Communications Director at Reolink</em>
</div>
<h2>Devices</h2>
<p class='img'><video src="/images/blog/2025-04-reolink/argus-track.webm" autoplay muted loop playsinline>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>ü§ñ Security has never looked so friendly... and private.</p>
<p>In case you didn‚Äôt know, Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, and the support of <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers funds this work. Reolink has certified the following devices:</p>

<h2>Open Home Foundation year one</h2>
<p style="margin-top: -1.2em;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=U7oCoNE0TLsWoUX8&t=601">(00:10:10)</a></p>
<p>State of the Open Home is our annual opportunity to share the latest developments, celebrate community achievements, and outline our vision for the future of the Open Home.</p>
<p>It was at last year‚Äôs State of the Open Home that <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/blog/announcing-the-open-home-foundation/">we announced the Open Home Foundation</a>. I donated Home Assistant to the Foundation, and others in the community followed suit by contributing vital projects that form the core of the Open Home ecosystem. That‚Äôs also where we set out our mission: to fight for privacy (your data is yours), choice (no vendor lock-in), and sustainability (devices built to last).</p>
<p>The Foundation wasn‚Äôt just paperwork‚Äîit took us from being ‚Äújust‚Äù a bunch of (very big) open-source GitHub projects to being seen as serious industry players. We‚Äôre now recognized as a peer, invited to speak at events like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMif_tYODNU">Connections summit at CES</a>, joining the <a href="/blog/2024/09/24/we-are-joining-the-z-wave-alliance-board/">Z-Wave Alliance board</a>, and even being named by <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91269253/consumer-electronics-most-innovative-companies-2025">Fast Company as a top innovator</a>‚Äîall because we respect user data! People always knew that we were building cool things, but now they understand why we were doing it.</p>
<p class="img"><lite-youtube videoid="q20H9qOX1Ss" videotitle="The fake promise of better Siri" videoStartAt="5750"></lite-youtube>Vergecast talking about realizing that Home Assistant is the real deal!</p>
<h2>Powering the Open Home</h2>
<p style="margin-top: -1.2em;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=la1eHQWR0R3IwO2f&t=1393">(00:23:13)</a></p>
<p>There are now 56 people working full-time to support Open Home projects and the community that surrounds them. These are some of the biggest open source projects in the world, including Home Assistant, ESPHome, Z-Wave JS, Zigpy, Open Home Matter Server, our voice technology, apps, and more. Many of the founders of these Open Home projects now work for the Open Home Foundation, turning their part-time passions into full-time careers - our in-house expertise is truly industry-leading. Supporting all this work requires a steady stream of income.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/ohf-structure.jpg' alt="how we fund our projects"/></p>
<p>Nabu Casa existed before the Open Home Foundation, and during State of the Open Home 2025, <a href="https://github.com/bbangert">Ben Bangert</a>, Nabu Casa‚Äôs co-founder and CTO, explained why and how it was set up,</p>
<div class="alert">Our approach at Nabu Casa has always been about sustainable growth. By avoiding the startup model, we can ensure we are under no pressure to compromise on our mission and values. It has driven our ability to hire and expand the company without taking on outside interests that would have goals that don't align with ours.</div>
<p>Nabu Casa builds and maintains the products that make Home Assistant easier to use, like <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> and <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/">hardware</a>. A big chunk of its profit continues to go to projects like Home Assistant, but now it does so via the Open Home Foundation. The Open Home Foundation builds on Nabu Casa‚Äôs original intent of removing outside pressures from the projects it funds, allowing them never to be bought or ruined by commercial meddling.</p>
<h2>Foundation upgrades</h2>
<p>In the year since launching the Foundation, more steps have been taken to protect the Open Home. We chose Switzerland to base the Foundation as it provided the best protection for these projects. We recently transitioned from a Swiss Verein to <a href="https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/we-are-number-one/#:~:text=Important%20changes%20to%20the%20Open%20Home%20Foundation">a more protective Stiftung</a>. We also achieved tax-exempt status, meaning your support can go even further. Where previously, all 56 employees worked for Nabu Casa, now all employees who work directly on Foundation projects work for the Foundation, further enhancing the independence of Foundation projects.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/ohf-growth.jpg' alt="Employees move from Nabu Casa to the Foundation"/>The Open Home Foundation is growing</p>
<p>A big shout-out to <a href="https://github.com/pvizeli">Pascal</a>! He was instrumental in starting the Foundation and has spent the last year fine-tuning its operation.</p>
<h2>Donations and Partnerships</h2>
<p style="margin-top: -1.2em;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=nnxO8H4GTtYRuMEL&t=1598">(00:26:38)</a></p>
<p>This year, we received several high-profile donations, and at the State of the Open Home, we announced another considerable donation: <a href="https://www.espressif.com/">Espressif</a> has donated $25,000 to the Foundation! Espressif designs many of the chips that power ESPHome. They are supporting Open Home software development to help drive the DIY sensor and controller revolution forward.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/ohf-supporters.jpg' alt="Commercial Partner: Nabu Casa. Donors: DuckDuckGo, Espressif. Supporters: Cloudflare, Ghost, GitHub, Lokalise, Netlify, Sentry."/>More than donations, we have projects that provide amazing in-kind support</p>
<p>Late last year, we received <a href="https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/the-era-of-open-voice/#:~:text=DuckDuckGo%20donates%20to%20the%20Open%20Home%20Foundation">$25,000 from DuckDuckGo</a> for being part of a better Internet ecosystem. These two sizeable donations make a meaningful impact on our work, and we are incredibly grateful for the support of these two organizations that believe in our mission. We also always try to support the projects that we believe are vital to our work and the broader Open Home ecosystem. That is why this year we started recurring donations to <a href="https://buildroot.org/sponsors.html">Buildroot</a>, <a href="https://opencollective.com/alpinelinux">Alpine</a>, and <a href="https://opencollective.com/aio-libs">aiohttp</a>.</p>
<p>As we said previously, we want sustainable funding, and small intermittent donations don‚Äôt allow us to effectively financially plan. <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/">Home Assistant Cloud subscriptions</a> remain the best way for individuals to support us financially.</p>
<h2>New Open Home Foundation projects</h2>
<p style="margin-top: -1.2em;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=6LVwbMVNkipqRcma&t=1903">(00:31:34)</a></p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/hacs-ma.jpg' alt="Music Assistant and HACS become OHF projects"/></p>
<p>The Open Home Foundation owns and governs over 240 open standards, drivers, and libraries that support the realization of the Open Home, and it‚Äôs time to add a couple more.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/marcelveldt">Marcel van der Veldt</a> joined the live stream to announce that he has donated <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/">Music Assistant</a> to the Open Home Foundation! Music Assistant has always been deeply entwined with multiple Open Home projects, and we‚Äôre excited to see how this extra support will allow more people to take back control of their music, on their players. If you want some interesting insight into Music Assistant, my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=6LVwbMVNkipqRcma&amp;t=1903">interview with Marcel</a> during the event is a must-watch.</p>
<p>And there was more! The <a href="https://www.hacs.xyz/">Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)</a>, created by <a href="https://github.com/ludeeus">Joakim S√∏rensen</a>, has also been donated to the Open Home Foundation! HACS is an amazing tool for the community, giving more choice to Home Assistant users and serving as a great starting point for your development journey. These projects are such a fantastic fit for the Foundation‚ÄîI wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you already thought they were part of it.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p style="margin-top: -1.2em;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=Kxw6dH5h6p8QLdKb&t=2940">(00:49:00)</a></p>
<p>When asked at a recent event ‚ÄúWhat is my North Star?‚Äù, my answer came quickly, it is the ‚ÄúCommunity‚Äù. Nothing we do would be possible without our contributions, and supporters. Meeting community members during my travels is one of the best parts of this job.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/frenck">Franck Nijhof</a>, Home Assistant Lead at the Open Home Foundation, took the stage to celebrate the incredible community. He shared some of the biggest community highlights of the year, including becoming the most active open source project on GitHub (21,000+ unique contributors in 2024!) and winning the most welcoming open-source project award. He emphasized that this success belongs to the entire community, which extends far beyond developers, as there are so many ways to contribute including being a translator, designer, tester, forum helper, or content creator.</p>
<p>Our community is doing amazing things with Home Assistant,</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/runar.jpg' alt="R√∫nar Bj√∂rn Herrera using Home Assistant in his home"/>Check out how R√∫nar Bj√∂rn Herrera is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=D57cJ7Moy2nd5g-z&t=3788">making his home more accessible</a> and sharing his expertise with the community. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=D57cJ7Moy2nd5g-z&t=3788">(01:03:08)</a></p>
<p>One big announcement Franck made was that this year we went from 1 million to over 2 million active installations in 2024! The key to harnessing this community power, Franck explained, is actively listening and building with users, not just for them, but with them. Initiatives like the <a href="/blog/2024/11/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck/">‚ÄúMonth of What The Heck?!‚Äù</a> and adapting plans based on feedback (like with backups) demonstrate this commitment to iterating together, even when initial ideas need adjustment.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/HA-community-day.jpg' alt="Home Assistant Community Day will be on May 24th 2025"/></p>
<p>Looking ahead, the goal is to deepen this collaboration by developing ‚Äúfully in the open‚Äù across all disciplines, fostering a collective intelligence. To further strengthen these connections, Franck announced the first official <strong>Home Assistant Community Day on May 24th, 2025</strong> üéâ, encouraging users worldwide to organize and attend local meetups.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p style="margin-top: -1.2em;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=W-QRbgOtwuIwddlX&t=4083">(01:08:03)</a></p>
<p>We want the Foundation projects to serve our community, and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôve put a bigger focus on research. <a href="https://github.com/anakinsbrna">Annika Schulz</a> is our UX Researcher, and at this year‚Äôs State of the Open Home, she gave us a fantastic overview of the privacy-respecting research we‚Äôre conducting and the invaluable insights it is bringing.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/ohf-survey.jpg' alt="Home Assistant Community Day will be on May 24th 2025"/>You love choice! but we're still learning what privacy and sustainability mean to you.</p>
<p>Our 2024 Community Survey was a huge success, with over 8,600 responses! We learned so much about who uses Home Assistant. For instance, a big majority of the people who answered the survey are tech-curious, have been using HA for 3+ years, live in households of 2.8 people on average, and have somewhere between 11-100 devices üòé (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=W-QRbgOtwuIwddlX&amp;t=4083">watch the whole segment</a>, there are so many interesting results!). We also delved into their motivations and how deeply our values of Choice and Privacy resonate, even if the practical implementation of privacy remains a challenge for many. Annika‚Äôs key message ‚Äì ‚ÄúUser research helps remind us‚Ä¶ We are not the users.‚Äù ‚Äì we need to challenge our assumptions and personal biases.</p>
<h2>Works with Home Assistant</h2>
<p style="margin-top: -1.2em;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=EeNgbeu5_8eiYsfR&t=5053">(01:24:13)</a></p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/wwha.jpg' alt="Miranda and Paulus talking about Works with Home Assistant"/></p>
<p>With choice playing such a big part in why our community uses Open Home projects, it‚Äôs crucial to ensure users can find great devices that align with our values. <a href="https://github.com/miranda-gb">Miranda Bishop</a>, our Partnership Manager, joined me to discuss the ‚ÄúWorks with Home Assistant‚Äù program. Explaining it isn‚Äôt about exclusion but about <em>highlighting</em> manufacturers committed to local control. They also sign an agreement to provide long-term support and be a positive force in the community.</p>
<p>We had a couple of our existing partners send us messages about joining the program, and thanks for the warm words. Also teased during the live stream were new partners close to formally joining the program, including <a href="https://reolink.com/">Reolink</a>, <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en">Eve</a>, and <a href="https://www.shelly.com/">Shelly</a> (but more details on those soon). Miranda stressed that the program isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpay us money and you can have the badge‚Äù; it‚Äôs about shared ethics of privacy, choice, and sustainability. The goal remains: within 3 years, to offer certified choices for every device type, everywhere, at all budgets. Your feedback helps drive this ‚Äì keep telling manufacturers you want local control and point them to the <a href="https://works-with.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant program</a>, as we‚Äôre here to help.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/mob-museum.jpg' alt="Video showing the Mob Museum in Las Vegas using Shelly and Home Assistant"/>Shelly with Home Assistant helps <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=vv6v0F-Pzv-46iMQ&t=6897">automate Las Vegas' Mob Museum</a>, including its moonshine production! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=vv6v0F-Pzv-46iMQ&t=6897">(01:54:00)</a></p>
<h2>Voice &amp; AI</h2>
<p style="margin-top: -1.2em;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=EskXSERmtLVlyAUg&t=5765">(01:36:05)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/synesthesiam/">Mike Hansen</a>, our ‚ÄúVoice Guy,‚Äù was the next to take the stage. In case you missed it, this year we launched our first voice hardware device, Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition, which pairs incredibly with all the voice software we‚Äôve been developing. To put it mildly, it‚Äôs been a pretty big hit! Mike explained how we built it to help push forward open source voice development, and it‚Äôs very much succeeding. Before Voice Preview Edition there wasn‚Äôt an Icelandic-speaking voice assistant, this is now being developed‚Äîall without a single person at the Foundation speaking this language.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/voice-ai.jpg' alt="JLo's voice AI setup"/>
<a href="https://github.com/jlpouffier">@Jlo's</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=VLjKXJoGuSXZmsRd&t=6157">AI-powered home in action (01:42:37)</a></p>
<p>Mike touched on future plans for more conversational interactions and enhanced integration with Music Assistant. He also addressed AI, explaining how we see Home Assistant as the perfect private playground for users to experiment with AI technologies locally, focusing on utility, not monetization, unlike the big players. A landline phone on set even rang during the segment with an AI-powered notification from <em>my own</em> Home Assistant‚Äîapologies, it predates silent mode ‚òéÔ∏è.</p>
<h2>Living Our Values</h2>
<p style="margin-top: -1.2em;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=dWjKOI0s8ZE5JV5T&t=7025">(01:57:05)</a></p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/values.jpg' alt="Paulus, Annika, Franck, and Madelena speaking about values"/></p>
<p>We wrapped up with a discussion focused on our values with Annika Schulz, Franck Nijhof, and Madelena Mak. We touched on user privacy concerns Annika uncovered, the diverse ways Franck sees ‚Äòchoice‚Äô manifesting (beyond just protocols, including local APIs), and how sustainability, as Madelena explained, connects to durability, energy management, and the right to repair.</p>
<p>Finally, together with <a href="https://github.com/madelena">Madelena Mak</a>, we looked back at our 2024 <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-introduction/">roadmap</a> ‚Äì I‚Äôm proud we delivered on nearly everything we set out to do, including top community requests. This builds trust. We gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=zc_AKoWOKtx4zIB1&amp;t=7855">glimpse into our 2025 Roadmap</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=H1jmjDisJ4tckLak&amp;t=8211">02:16:51</a>), including a new focus on harnessing our collective intelligence. This will be driven by a new information architecture that gives context to devices via a device database (expect a detailed post on Roadmap 2025 soon!).</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-04-SOTOH/closing.jpg' alt="Paulus, Franck, and Madelena celebrate the shows finale"/></p>
<p>The live Q&amp;A session at the end was, as always, a highlight, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?si=WeI5OUe9lLdcZcii&amp;t=9258">tackling great questions from the audience</a>.</p>
<p>It was an energizing day, reaffirming my belief in our mission and the incredible power of this community. We‚Äôre building something unique and important together. Thank you to everyone who watched, participated, and continuously supports the Open Home. Your belief in this project makes it all possible.</p>
<p>And, of course, a huge thank you to all our <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud subscribers</a>. Your financial support is the bedrock that allows the Open Home Foundation to thrive and continue driving innovation in the private, open smart home.</p>

<p>Home Assistant 2025.4! üéâ</p>
<p>It‚Äôs April 2nd, so this is definitely not an April Fool‚Äôs joke! üòÉ</p>
<p>But before diving into this month‚Äôs release, I want to quickly highlight
something you might have missed‚Äîsomething I‚Äôm extremely excited about:</p>
<p><strong><a href="/blog/2025/03/26/state-of-the-open-home-2025-announcement/">The State of the Open Home 2025</a></strong>!</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right! On <strong>Saturday, April 12th, 2025</strong>, we‚Äôll be
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4Vctz1_KYE">streaming a big live event on YouTube</a>,
sharing our vision for the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org">Open Home Foundation</a>,
including the future of Home Assistant. Don‚Äôt miss it!</p>
<p>Alright, back to the release! As I was saying, it‚Äôs April already, and we have
another fantastic release lined up for you.</p>
<p>The big news is the introduction of our <strong>new experimental Areas dashboard</strong>,
which might evolve to become the default dashboard in the future. If you‚Äôre like
me‚Äînot really a UI-oriented person‚Äîyou‚Äôre going to love this one! ü§©</p>
<p>My personal absolute favorite feature this month is something I‚Äôve dreamed of
ever since we started working on voice assistants: <strong>the ability for your
assistant to start a conversation proactively!</strong> This is a game
changer‚Äî<strong>no other</strong> voice assistant on the market can do this!
I‚Äôm going to have so much fun with this. üòÉ</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre a power user who loves templates, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîwe‚Äôve got you covered
too! This release ships with <strong>a bunch of new template functions</strong>, making your
life a lot easier.</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>

<h2>Dashboards</h2>
<p>We‚Äôre making dashboards smarter‚Äîautomagically!</p>
<p>Dashboards allow you to monitor and control different aspects of your home.
They are one of the main interfaces for interacting with Home Assistant,
and a key contributor to what we call the Home Approval Factor‚Äîhow useful
and welcoming your smart home feels to everyone who lives in it.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we have focused on making dashboards easier to create and
customize. We introduced the powerful drag-and-drop sections view and plenty
of new tile card features.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre going a step further by delivering a dashboard that‚Äôs immediately
relevant, saving you time and effort while still leaving room for personal
touches.</p>
<h3>A new experimental Areas dashboard</h3>
<p>Until now, our default dashboard has served as a simple starting point‚Äîa list
of <span class='terminology'>entities<span class='terminology-tooltip'>An entity represents a sensor, actor, or function in Home Assistant. Entities are used to monitor physical properties or to control other entities. An entity is usually part of a device or a service.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/entities_domains/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> grouped by <span class='terminology'>area<span class='terminology-tooltip'>An area in Home Assistant is a <a href="/docs/organizing/">logical grouping</a> of devices and entities that are meant to match areas (or rooms) in the physical world: your home. For example, the <code>living room</code> area groups devices and entities in your living room.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/organizing/areas/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> or <span class='terminology'>device<span class='terminology-tooltip'>A device is a model representing a physical or logical unit that contains entities.</span></span>
<span class='terminology'>domains<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Each integration in Home Assistant has a unique identifier: The domain. It is often shown as the first part (before the dot) of entity IDs.</span></span>. While helpful for beginners, it quickly becomes limited as
a smart home grows. We‚Äôve learned that while some users enjoy building their
own dashboards, many simply want something that works for their household.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot viewing an area of the new experimental Areas dashboard" src="/images/blog/2025-04/areas-dashboard-detail.png" />
<p>The new experimental <a href="/dashboards/dashboards/#areas-dashboard">Areas dashboard</a> automatically generates a ready-to-use
dashboard based on the areas you‚Äôve set up in your home. It uses <a href="/dashboards/sections/">sections</a> and
<a href="/dashboards/tile/">tile cards</a> for a modern, clean, and intuitive look‚Äîinstantly. No more starting
from a blank slate!</p>
<p>Each <a href="/docs/organizing/areas/">area</a> now has its own dedicated page, giving you a clear and organized view
of the devices in that space. Entities, such as lights, covers, cameras,
and more, are automatically grouped by domain so you can easily locate the ones
you need.</p>
<p>Want to tweak it? <em>Yes, you can</em>! You can rearrange, show, or hide entities to
suit your preferences. At the top of each area page, temperature and humidity
badges quickly indicate room comfort levels, which are configurable in the
area‚Äôs settings.</p>
<p>On top of all that, the Overview page brings it all together, showing all your
areas in one place. Each section corresponds to a room in your home, and just
like with the area pages, you can rearrange, show, or hide areas here as well,
based on your preferences.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the overview page of the new Areas dashboard" src="/images/blog/2025-04/areas-dashboard-overview.png" />
<p>If you haven‚Äôt <a href="/docs/organizing/areas/">organized your devices into areas</a> yet, now‚Äôs the perfect time to
start‚Äîit‚Äôs key to unlocking this new dashboard experience. To get
started with the <a href="/dashboards/dashboards/#areas-dashboard">Areas dashboard</a>, go to
<strong><a href='https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/lovelace_dashboards' class='my' target='_blank'>Settings &gt; Dashboards</a></strong>, and select
<strong>Add Dashboard</strong> in the bottom right, next select the <strong>Areas (experimental)</strong>
option from the dialog:</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the dialog when adding a new dashboard, showing the new option to add the new experimental Area dashboard" src="/images/blog/2025-04/areas-experimental-dialog.png" />
<p>The new experimental <a href="/dashboards/dashboards/#areas-dashboard">Areas dashboard</a> previews what‚Äôs to come. We‚Äôve learned from
our users that they organize their homes in different ways‚Äîby rooms,
by function, by device, and more. They often combine all of the above,
and therefore, our upcoming default dashboard will accommodate
all these methods of <a href="/docs/organizing/">organization</a>.</p>
<p>Over time, this foundation will grow into a flexible system that adapts to
your priorities, whether that‚Äôs keeping an eye on security, managing energy use,
going through your family calendar and chores, learning about the weather,
or simply watching your pets.</p>
<p>Please note that this is experimental, meaning it is subject to change and may
not always work as intended. We would love your feedback if you notice some
aspects we can improve. The community‚Äôs dashboards, shared over the years,
have helped shape this design, and we would love to see how it works
with a wide variety of your homes. Even if you already have the perfect
dashboard built for your home, try it!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> We had a feedback form in the release notes in this spot, but that‚Äôs closed now. Thanks for your input!</p>
<h3>Time for a new card!</h3>
<p>It has been a while since we introduced a new card, but this release, we
thought it might be <em><strong>time</strong></em> to add a new one! Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mrdarrengriffin">@mrdarrengriffin</a>,
Home Assistant now features a <a href="/dashboards/clock/">Clock card</a>!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing a dashboard with a large clock card on it, indicating the current time" src="/images/blog/2025-04/card-clock.png" />
<p>Yeah, the card is ‚Äújust‚Äù showing the current time, but it is a really nice
addition to our card collection. It might be a great card for dashboards
you are showing on things like a wall-mounted tablet!</p>
<p>The Clock card offers several customization options, including the ability to
adjust the clock size, timezone, display the seconds alongside the hours
and minutes, and the ability to choose between a 12-hour or 24-hour format.</p>
<p>For more details, check out the <a href="/dashboards/clock/">Clock card documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>Voice</h2>
<p>The <em><strong><a href="/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/">‚Äúyear of the voice‚Äù</a></strong></em> might be behind
us, but we keep improving the voice experience in Home Assistant! This release
brings several enhancements to make interacting with your smart home even better.</p>
<h3>Improved Voice Wizard</h3>
<p>If you set up a Home Assistant voice assistant compatible device,
like the <a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a>,
you will be guided through setting up your voice assistant, and this experience
has been greatly improved in this release.</p>
<p>As our voice experience is offering more choices, including local options
like Speech-to-Phrase, we wanted to make sure you are able to make the right
choices for your use case.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Two screenshots showing the new voice wizard that guides you setting up the best possible voice experience" src="/images/blog/2025-04/voice-wizard.png" />
<p>The wizard will now help you make a more informed decision based on your
language, desired functionality, and device capabilities, ensuring you get the
best experience with your voice assistant.</p>
<h3>Continued conversation with LLMs</h3>
<p>Ever tried to have a conversation with your voice assistant that is hooked up to
an LLM like ChatGPT? It‚Äôs good fun. However, having to say <em>‚ÄúOk Nabu‚Äù</em>, whenever
you answer one of Assist‚Äôs questions can really slow things down.</p>
<p>This release introduces the ability to have a continued conversation with LLMs.
If the LLM returns with a question, we will detect that and keep the
conversation going, without the need for you to say <em>‚ÄúOk Nabu‚Äù</em> again.</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="KyAuzYe4vAw" videotitle="Continued conversation demo"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>This is a great way to have a more natural conversation with your voice
assistants, and it works with all LLMs supported by Home Assistant.</p>
<h3>Starting conversations</h3>
<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6VvzDSI8RU&amp;t=4750s">Voice chapter 9</a>,
we added the ability for Home Assistant <a href="/blog/2025/02/13/voice-chapter-9-speech-to-phrase/#home-assistant-phones-home-analog-phones-are-back">to call analog phones to start a
conversation</a>. As of this release, this
feature is now available for ESPHome-based voice assistants,
like the <a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a>!</p>
<p>This is a fantastic feature, as it allows you to build your own automations that
can send out voice prompts from your voice assistant and listen for a response,
instead of you having to trigger the conversation by saying the wake word.</p>
<p>Imagine, for example, you have left the garage door open, and a few minutes
later, your assistant says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, I noticed you left the garage door open, do you want me to close it for you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You simply reply ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno,‚Äù and it handles the rest‚Ä¶ ü§Ø Or perhaps after a
long day at work, you return home, and your assistant greets you warmly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome home, Frenck! Hope you had a great day. Want to hear the news or maybe enjoy some music?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>JLo made a great demo video of this one, involving his oven and the assistant
asking if he wants to set a timer:</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="dq7--T_pVNA" videotitle="Starting a conversation from the Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for voice-driven automations.
Currently, this capability is only available when using LLM integrations,
but we‚Äôre exploring more use cases where it would be helpful.</p>
<p>If you listen closely to the demo above, you‚Äôll notice a brief pre-announce
sound just before the conversation starts. This little notification prevents
your assistant from startling anyone by suddenly speaking out of nowhere and
preventing a jump scare! ü´£</p>
<p>You could even use custom sounds based on the scenario‚Äîlike a doorbell chime
for visitors or a train station-style jingle when your morning commute gets
delayed, giving you extra time to grab that coffee before heading out. ‚òï</p>
<h2>Onboarding with a Home Assistant Cloud backup</h2>
<p>If you are a user of <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/">Home Assistant Cloud by Nabu Casa</a>, it means
you can safely store a backup of your Home Assistant installation in the cloud
as part of your subscription. A really convenient service that ensures you always
have a secure and worry-free backup of your Home Assistant installation, no
matter what happens.</p>
<p>Now, let‚Äôs say something did happen, maybe a hardware failure, or maybe you
are migrating to a new <a href="/green/">Home Assistant Green</a>, as of this release, you can
directly restore your backup from the Home Assistant Cloud during the
onboarding process of your new Home Assistant installation.</p>
<p>This means you can get up and running with your new Home Assistant installation
in no time, with all your settings, automations, and integrations restored from
your backup.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the restore from Nabu Casa's Home Assistant Cloud during set up" src="/images/blog/2025-04/restore-from-cloud.png" />

<h3>Integration quality scale achievements</h3>
<p>One thing we are incredibly proud of in Home Assistant is our
<a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/quality_scale/">integration quality scale</a>. This scale helps us and our contributors to ensure
integrations are of high quality, maintainable, and provide the best possible
user experience.</p>
<p>This release, we celebrate several <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> that have improved
their quality scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>4 integrations reached platinum</strong> üèÜ</p>

</ul>
<p>This is a huge achievement for these integrations and their maintainers. The
effort and dedication required to reach these quality levels is significant,
as it involves extensive testing, documentation, error handling, and often
complete rewrites of parts of the integration.</p>
<p>A big thank you to all the contributors involved! üëè</p>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/yellow">Home Assistant Yellow Zigbee/Thread chip</a> and <a href="/connectzbt1">Home Assistant ZBT-1</a>
can now be updated directly through Home Assistant update entities.
Nice <a href="https://github.com/puddly">@puddly</a>!</li>
<li>When viewing the details of an entity in the entity dialog, we now provide
more context about where the entity originates. Like its device and the area
it is in. This is a first step in sprinkling more context throughout our UI.
Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/piitaya">@piitaya</a>!</li>
<li>We now provide sensors about your <a href="/integrations/backup">backups</a>! Providing you information
on things like when your last backup ran. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/mib1185">@mib1185</a>!</li>
<li>This one is interesting if you make Blueprints. The <a href="/docs/blueprint/selectors/#device-selector">device selector</a> now
supports filtering by model ID. Thanks for this one <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a>!</li>
<li>We now support turning on/off TVs in <a href="/integrations/homekit">HomeKit</a>, nice one <a href="https://github.com/bdraco">@bdraco</a>!</li>
<li>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/piitaya">@piitaya</a>, we now support lawn mower devices in <a href="/integrations/google_assistant">Google Assistant</a>
and <a href="/integrations/homekit">HomeKit</a>!</li>
<li>Variables in automations &amp; scripts have been greatly simplified and fixed by
<a href="https://github.com/arturpragacz">@arturpragacz</a>. All variables are now accessible anywhere in the script or
automation, greatly simplifying the use of variables. Amazing!</li>
<li>We now support adding additional interactions to cards! The hold and
double tap actions are now available through the UI. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/piitaya">@piitaya</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Templates</h2>
<p>If you are a power user, you probably use <span class='terminology'>templates<span class='terminology-tooltip'>A template is an automation definition that can include variables for the action or data from the trigger values. This allows automations to generate dynamic actions.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/automation/templating/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> in your
automations, scripts, or maybe even your dashboard. This release has a few
additions to our template engine that you might find useful.</p>
<p>To start with, in the <a href="/integrations/template">template integration</a> the light and switch templates have
been migrated to support the new and modern YAML style. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a> for
this one!</p>
<p>More noteworthy is the addition of a series of new template functions to make
working with data a lot easier:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/docs/configuration/templating/#combining-dictionaries"><code>combine</code></a> ‚Äì Combine multiple dictionaries.</li>
<li><a href="/docs/configuration/templating/#find-elements-in-first-list-not-in-second-list"><code>difference</code></a> ‚Äì Find elements present in one list but not another.</li>
<li><a href="/docs/configuration/templating/#flatten-a-list-of-lists"><code>flatten</code></a> ‚Äì Flatten a list of lists into a single list.</li>
<li><a href="/docs/configuration/templating/#floors"><code>floor_entities</code></a> ‚Äì Retrieve entities associated with a specific floor.</li>

<li><a href="/docs/configuration/templating/#shuffling"><code>shuffle</code></a> ‚Äì Randomly shuffle items in a list.</li>
<li><a href="/docs/configuration/templating/#find-elements-that-are-in-either-list-but-not-in-both"><code>symmetric_difference</code></a> ‚Äì Find items in either list but not in both.</li>
<li><a href="/docs/configuration/templating/#determining-types"><code>typeof</code></a> ‚Äì Determine the type of a variable or object for debugging.</li>
<li><a href="/docs/configuration/templating/#combine-all-unique-elements-from-two-lists"><code>union</code></a> ‚Äì Merge unique elements from two lists.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Device hierarchy for energy management</h2>
<p>This release, <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a> has introduced an improvement to Home Assistant‚Äôs
energy management system‚Äîone that‚Äôs been highly requested by the community.</p>
<p>This means you can now create a <strong>device hierarchy</strong> within your energy
configuration, establishing parent-child relationships between devices.</p>
<p>For example, imagine having a breaker monitoring the total energy consumption
of a circuit, but also separately tracking individual devices connected to that
circuit. Previously, Home Assistant might double-count this usage. Now, it
understands these relationships and accurately shows the individual device
usage without duplication.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Sreenshot of the individual device usage graph taken from the energy dashboard" src="/images/blog/2025-04/energy-management-device-hierarchy.png" />
<p>In this screenshot, the water heater is a child of the heat pump. Both report
energy usage separately, but the water heater‚Äôs consumption is also included in
the total reported by the heat pump. With device hierarchy enabled,
Home Assistant correctly shows the usage of each device.</p>
<p>Awesome addition there <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a>!</p>
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.4 in April.
These patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch
release every Friday.</p>

it is inevitable.</p>
<p>We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:</p>

    <link href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/03/27/motionblinds-joins-wwha/"/>
    <updated>2025-03-27T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/03/27/motionblinds-joins-wwha</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-03-motionblinds/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Motionblinds wwha logo">
<p>We‚Äôre excited to announce the latest partner to join the <a href="https://partner.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant</a> program is <a href="https://motionblinds.com/">Motionblinds</a>! And if you‚Äôre wondering what type of products they provide, the clue really is in the name!</p>
<p>Motionblinds is the first Works with Home Assistant partner to certify smart window blinds. This brings us closer to a future where you can build a smart home exclusively with certified devices that give the best possible experience with Home Assistant.¬† Smart blinds integrated with Home Assistant unlock powerful automations, such as blinds opening when you get home, or closing sun-facing blinds on warmer days to keep your home cool. <!--more--></p>
<h2>Shades of innovation</h2>
<p>Motionblinds is a brand from Coulisse, a company from the Netherlands, that has been making window coverings for the past 30 years. Motionblinds are available worldwide and are known for their beautiful, customizable designs, coupled with smart technology. They not only provide all-in-one smart blinds, but also upgrade kits for your existing roller blinds, which is great for cutting down on waste.</p>
<h2>A window to the future</h2>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-03-motionblinds/powered-by-eve.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Motionblinds powered by Eve">
<p>Motionblinds are definitely a leader in the smart blinds space and have partnered with <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en">Eve</a> Systems, a leading provider of smart home devices, headquartered in Germany and part of ABB. This partnership brings Matter-over-Thread to their motors. Together, we have tested and certified these Matter-certified Eve Motionblinds. It‚Äôs easy to tell which are part of Works with Home Assistant, as they‚Äôll include the ‚Äúpowered by Eve‚Äù badge.</p>
<p>Motionblinds that use Bluetooth and 433MHz technology will also be getting the ‚ÄòWorks With Home Assistant‚Äô treatment, as we‚Äôre certifying motors that connect via the Motionblinds Matter Bridge (CM-55). This provides an excellent local way to connect this additional range of products to Home Assistant, allowing many more Motionblinds motors to give the best experience with Home Assistant. Check out our <a href="https://next.home-assistant.io/integrations/motionblinds_matter/">Motionblinds integrations page</a> for a full list of the different motors that are certified. Be aware that standalone, Bluetooth-integrated blinds are not currently certified under the ‚ÄòWorks With‚Äô program.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-motionblinds/matter-hub.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Motionblinds Matter Bridge">Motionblinds Matter Bridge (CM-55)</p>
<p>Home Assistant was recently <a href="/blog/2025/03/10/matter-certification/">Matter certified</a>, and with these blinds certified to work with Home Assistant, end-to-end these devices are going to give a seamless experience. Every Works with Home Assistant product is tested by our team, works locally, and the brand promises to provide great long-term support.</p>
<h3>Which devices have been certified?</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://motionblinds.com/products/roller">Roller Shades</a></li>
<li><a href="https://motionblinds.com/products/double-roller">Double Roller Shades</a></li>
<li><a href="https://motionblinds.com/products/venetian">Venetian Blinds</a></li>
<li><a href="https://motionblinds.com/products/honeycomb">Honeycomb Shades</a></li>
<li><a href="https://motionblinds.com/products/curtains">Curtains</a></li>
<li><a href="https://motionblinds.com/products/pleated">Pleated Shades</a></li>
<li><a href="https://motionblinds.com/products/vertical">Vertical Blinds</a></li>
<li><a href="https://motionblinds.com/products/roman">Roman Shades</a></li>
<li><a href="https://motionblinds.com/products/upgrade-kit">Upgrade Kit for Roller Blinds</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All these devices connect directly to Home Assistant via Matter, provided you pick the ‚Äúpowered by Eve‚Äù option, or combine with the Matter bridge. We‚Äôre big fans of open standards like Matter, because they bring great benefits when it comes to local control, privacy, and long-term support.</p>
<h2>Closing thoughts ü™ü</h2>
<p>A big thanks to both Coulisse and Eve for putting their time and effort into bringing Motionblinds to the Works with Home Assistant program. This is really plugging a blind spot in our Works with program by covering new ground and opening up some exciting options for our community üòÉ.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-matter-certification/art.jpg' alt="Home Assistant is officially matter certified" class='no-shadow' /></p>
<p>Matter in Home Assistant has been officially certified! üéâ The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) has certified <a href="https://csa-iot.org/csa_product/home-assistant/">Home Assistant</a> and the <a href="https://csa-iot.org/csa_product/open-home-foundation-matter-server/">Open Home Foundation Matter Server</a>, the first open-source project to receive this certification. Certification is proof that open source projects can sit among, or even above, big tech when it comes to providing the best smart home experience.</p>
<p>Home Assistant, as part of the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, strongly believes in open standards. They embody our values of choice, privacy, and sustainability in the smart home. When a standard is well supported, consumers get access to a wide range of smart home devices that should work far into the future, which is great for sustainability. Best of all, they work locally, keeping your smart home data in your home.</p>
<p>All these benefits led us to include open standards certification <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#open-standards-certified-quality">in our roadmap</a>. Home Assistant‚Äôs implementations of Matter, Zigbee, and Z-Wave are already industry-leading, so it only makes sense to clearly signal and give users peace of mind that we provide true compatibility. This most recent certification is not just big for Home Assistant, but read on to see how it also helps any open source project looking to use Matter.</p>

<h2>Matter matters</h2>
<p class="img"><lite-youtube videoid="rEugjMk-4II" videotitle="State of Matter 2024"></lite-youtube>Our live stream from 2024 explains Matter in depth</p>
<p>Matter is the latest smart home open standard, which is looking to connect and control smart home devices regardless of their manufacturer or which ecosystem you want to control them from. Like the other open standards we support, it can be controlled fully locally, meaning these devices are not reliant on the cloud to work. The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) is the body behind the Matter standard, representing its many members. They certify devices and set the rules on how they work together.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre not familiar with Matter, I‚Äôm not surprised. Though its adoption is growing, it‚Äôs only a <a href="https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-arrives/">couple of years old</a>. The most important companies in the smart home space have joined this standard, but support is still growing and becoming more consistent. If it fulfills its promise, any smart home product should work with your ecosystem of choice, and that makes us optimistic about its future.</p>
<p>More and more Matter devices are entering the market, and if you‚Äôre buying new smart devices, it will just be a matter of time üòâ before you own one. To this point, Matter devices are even a part of our <a href="https://partner.home-assistant.io/">Works With Home Assistant</a> program. <a href="/blog/2024/09/03/aqara-joins-works-with-home-assistant/">Aqara was the first</a> to join our program with Matter devices, and we tested these devices ourselves to ensure they give the best experience possible in Home Assistant. This year, we expect many more Matter devices to join the program, and we should have more updates soon.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, Matter is really interesting‚Äîit can work with different smart home systems at the same time. It also keeps the way devices connect and communicate separate, allowing it to connect to devices over Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and <a href="/integrations/thread/">Thread</a> (a new mesh network technology for smart devices). Read our <a href="/blog/2024/01/25/matter-livestream-blog/">State of Matter blog</a> or watch Paulus‚Äô appearance on <a href="https://youtu.be/0Y75XEXAXfY?si=nSDpP6THkWhkARuc&amp;t=3493">the Vergecast Matter Holiday Spec-Tacular</a> for a deeper dive into the standard.</p>
<h2>What certification brings</h2>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-matter-certification/ha-matter.png' alt="Home Assistant Matter certification"/>Well, this is a bit... awesome</p>
<p>First and foremost, from a usability perspective, nothing will change for you. We are consistently the first to adopt the newest Matter versions, currently providing the highest version available. We‚Äôll keep on improving the Matter Server and the Matter integration at the same pace, ensuring that all device types in the Matter spec will work perfectly with Home Assistant‚Äîjust from now on it will come with this certification badge.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://csa-iot.org/csa_product/open-home-foundation-matter-server/">Open Home Foundation Matter Server</a> is now an officially trusted/certified software component, while <a href="https://csa-iot.org/csa_product/home-assistant/">Home Assistant</a> is a certified ‚ÄúUser Interface Component‚Äù (more on this distinction below). This allows us to clearly show this with a logo, along with being listed on the Matter website. For new Home Assistant users, this helps build confidence, knowing it is a supported way to use Matter. Similarly, for brands that don‚Äôt know much about Home Assistant, these references can be surprisingly helpful, and it‚Äôs our goal to have more brands target Home Assistant in their development. Another handy part of being certified is getting more access to pre-test new devices and SDK revisions, which will help development going forward.</p>
<h3>Why two certifications (and the server add-on)</h3>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-matter-certification/ohf-matter.png' alt="Open Home Foundation Matter Server is certified"/>So much fun we did it twice</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre confused why we certified both Home Assistant and Open Home Foundation Matter Server, there are a couple of legal/procedural reasons, but it comes with some useful benefits. We certified the server as a standalone component to allow any project to use it. Each project that uses it, including Home Assistant, will have to go through a certification process to acknowledge that it uses a certified component as a ‚ÄúUser Interface Component‚Äù. Certification for the Open Home Foundation Matter Server means it properly connects and communicates with other Matter devices, while certification for Home Assistant is about being able to display the Matter trademark.</p>
<p>This separation is important because it means that we won‚Äôt need to go through recertification every time we update Home Assistant. This way we can keep the Matter-related backend isolated in both a software and certification sense. This is also why we will need to continue to have the Open Home Foundation Matter Server as an add-on, and it cannot be built into <a href="/installation/#about-installation-methods">Home Assistant Core</a>.</p>
<h2>The road to certification</h2>
<p>Becoming Matter certified was not easy. When we started certification, the process was tooled up to test and certify devices, not Matter controllers, let alone completely software-based (and open source) controllers. We chose to collaborate with <a href="https://www.resillion.com/services/conformance-interoperability/wireless-product-testing/matter-certification/">Resillion</a> for our certification. They are a testing and certification house based in Belgium with a lot of experience certifying Matter products. They do the formal testing and submit the results to the CSA. Together, we collaborated to write thousands of lines of test scripts, ensuring that as many test cases as possible were automated.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-matter-certification/lab.jpg' alt="Marcel van der Veldt at the Resillion lab"/>My visit to Resillion's lab, I brought my own lab coat</p>
<p>We really appreciate Resillion for taking on this challenge. Not only were we the first controller they certified, but we also went for all the device types in the Matter 1.3 specification. This was a huge effort for all involved, but now that these test scripts exist, they only require minor updates for each new version; we can reuse them whenever we need to recertify.</p>
<div class="alert">
    <p>‚ÄúAt Resillion, we strongly support interoperability in connected home technology, and assure, secure and innovate to help make this technology work for everyone. For us, this was not only a fantastic way to contribute to the Home Assistant open-source project, but also upgrade our own Home Assistant instances with Matter, as enthusiasts of the project running active instances of HA in our own homes.</p>
    <p>‚ÄúWorking on a controller utilizing the full Matter 1.3 feature set presents a great opportunity to advance HA and Matter, and we look forward to supporting the developed codebase and further contributing to an open smart home.‚Äù</p>
    <em style="text-align: right; display: block;">- Jan Claes, Head of testing services - C&I Global, Resillion</em>
</div>
<p>This is another example of something that‚Äôs only possible because of the support we get from users subscribing to <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a>. Certification would be very difficult for any other open-source project, but we have the funding first to build a great server and also to pay for the required testing. Now this open source implementation exists and can be used by any project looking to add Matter.</p>
<h2>The future Matters</h2>
<p>As we continue improving our Matter implementation, the Matter standard itself is also evolving. Even with the progress it has made in the past year, there are still challenges to overcome. Matter is completely built on IPv6, and its rollout is uncovering the poor state of IPv6 support in today‚Äôs network hardware. Also, as it‚Äôs a complicated standard, it can be difficult to explain concepts like Thread and Fabrics to the average user, but hopefully users won‚Äôt need to be experts in the future to get the most out of Matter in their homes.</p>
<p>Some might call Matter the smart home standard to replace all others, but we believe that there‚Äôs room for multiple standards, each providing its own unique benefits. We are focused on providing the highest support for all local smart home standards (<a href="/blog/2024/11/15/roadmap-2024h2/#open-protocols">certifying other standards is on our roadmap</a>) and ensuring they work far into the future, which is great for consumer choice and sustainability.</p>
<p>As Home Assistant grows and takes important steps like certification, the more credibility we gain in the industry‚Äîit‚Äôs a virtuous circle that helps us and Open Home projects continuously improve. Thanks for your support and helping us make this possible üôè.</p>

<h2>Dashboard view headers</h2>
<p>This release brings a whole new look with the ability to add headers to your
dashboards. This allows you to add a title and welcoming text to your dashboards
using Markdown and even templates. Additionally, this gives you a lot of space
for badges next to the header.</p>
<p>As always, we‚Äôve baked in a lot of customization, with the ability to align the
header in multiple different ways. It comes with a responsive layout by default,
but you can also set it to always be left-aligned or center-aligned.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2025-03/dashboard-view-header.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new header feature in the dashboard view." />
<p>The badges can also be positioned below the text (default) or above the text. A
great visual menu makes it easy to choose how you want to organize your header.</p>
<h2>Tile cards</h2>
<p>This release has made many improvements and fine touches to the tile card. It
is one of the most versatile cards in Home Assistant,
and we have made it even better!</p>
<h3>Making tile card interactions clearer</h3>
<p>There is no doubt the tile card can do a lot, but ever since its creation,
it has had a little flaw that you might have run into yourself‚Ä¶</p>
<p>How would you know if tapping the icon on the tile card would trigger
an action or whether it would just display more information? We have addressed
this with some subtle visual language in this release!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2025-03/tile-card-clear-interactions.png" alt="Screenshot showing tile cards with and without direct actions on their icons. The ones that do have a direct action have a circular background, others don't." />
<p>When tapping the icon on the tile card directly performs an action,
like for example, turning on a light, the icon will have a circular background
around it. In all other cases, the little circle will not be displayed.</p>
<p>Now you know! üëç</p>
<h3>Position tile card features</h3>
<p>Since <a href="/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/#resize-the-cards-on-your-dashboard">we added support for resizing cards</a>,
we gained the ability to make very wide tile cards. These cards have a lot of
empty space surrounding them, which can be helpful at times.</p>
<p>But what if you could do something useful with that space? Now you can!
All features of a tile card can now be positioned inline in the tile card!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2025-03/tile-card-inline-features.png" alt="Screenshot showcasing the new inline tile card features (versus the existing bottom feature" />
<p>This brings a completely new look and feel, which we are sure you will love!
From the settings, you can add a feature, like a brightness slider, and position
it either below (bottom) or to the right side of the icon (inline).</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <p class="alert-title"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>
  <div class="alert-content">
<p>Only the first feature can be positioned inline; the rest will not be displayed.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3>New tile card features</h3>
<p>This release also ships with two new tile card features that can be
added to your entities to provide new controls. <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a> contributed these,
so a big shout out to him!</p>
<h4>Switch toggle</h4>
<p>The first addition is one that is just surprising we didn‚Äôt have it before:
A switch toggle! This allows you to toggle a switch entity directly from the
tile card.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2025-03/tile-card-switch-toggle.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new tile card feature for switch entities." />
<h4>Counter actions</h4>
<p>The second addition is a counter toggle. This allows you to add a button to
increase, decrease, or reset a counter entity directly from the tile card.</p>
<img class=" no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2025-03/tile-card-counter-actions.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new tile card feature for counter helper entities."/>
<h3>Tiny interaction improvements</h3>
<p>More tweaks to the tile card have been made to improve their interaction
experience. For example, we now have nice little animations when you hover over
the tile card, making it more apparent that it is interactive. Still, when you
tap the tile card, it will show a little animation to indicate that the
tap was registered.</p>
<center>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2025-03/tile-card-interactions.gif" alt="Screenrecording showing the new tiny micro interactions added to the tile card and a small demo of using keyboard navigation" />
</center>
<p>Another nice addition is that the tile card can now interact with your keyboard!
Tab and shift + tab your way across the screen like the keyboard warrior you are.</p>
<h3>Editor improvements</h3>
<p>Not just the tile card itself has been improved, but also the editor for
the tile card has been improved. It is now clearer and easier to use.</p>
<p>The new control gives you a better overview of what the option will do for
the tile card.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2025-03/card-editor-improvements.png" alt="Screenshot showing the brand new visual card editor that make it more visually clear what options do." />
<h2>Assist chat now has streaming responses</h2>
<p>If you have hooked up an LLM, like ChatGPT, to your Assist as
a conversation agent, it will now livestream the responses to you when
you are text chatting with it!</p>
<p>When experimenting with larger models, or on slower hardware, LLM‚Äôs can feel
sluggish. They only respond once the entire reply is generated, which can take
frustratingly long for lengthy responses (you‚Äôll be waiting a while if you ask
it to tell you an epic fairy tale).</p>
<p>We‚Äôve added support for LLMs to stream their response to the text chat, allowing you
to start reading while the response is being generated. A bonus side effect is
that commands are now also faster: they will be executed as soon as they come
in, without waiting for the rest of the message to be complete.</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="k6VvzDSI8RU" videoStartAt="3239" videotitle="Voice - Chapter 9"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>There was quite a lot more to tell around Assist and the new voice features;
in case you missed it, you can read all about it in this blog post:</p>

<a href="/integrations/unifi">Unifi integration</a>. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/Samywamy10">@Samywamy10</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Galorhallen">@Galorhallen</a> has added support for effects in <a href="/integrations/govee_light_local">Govee lights</a>. Nice!</li>
</ul>
<h3>SmartThings</h3>
<p>The <a href="/integrations/smartthings">SmartThings</a> integration has been completely rewritten! üéâ In December,
SmartThings shut down the old authentication method, but thanks to
SmartThings‚Äô hard work and close collaboration with us, <a href="https://github.com/joostlek">@joostlek</a> was able to
bring back the integration‚Äîbetter than ever.</p>
<p>No more setting up routing, exposing ports, or creating developer accounts with
access tokens‚Äî<strong>just log in with your Samsung account</strong>, and you‚Äôre good to go!</p>
<p>And there‚Äôs more! Push updates now work without exposing your instance to the
internet, making the experience faster, seamless, and more secure! üöÄ</p>
<p>A huge shoutout to our amazing community, who played a key role in this effort!
üíô When <a href="https://github.com/joostlek">@joostlek</a> shared a guide on gathering test data, the community
stepped up‚Äîsending in valuable test data that helped fine-tune the integration.
This collaboration truly made a difference!</p>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ever upgraded Home Assistant and needed to do a hard refresh in your
browser to make it work again? We have been able to reduce the cases in
which this happens! Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/bramkragten">@bramkragten</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a> made a small change with a big impact. When you set up a new
integration for a new device, Home Assistant will now redirect you to the
device page after setting it up. Nice!</li>
<li>There is now an option to add an extra margin to the top of a section view.
Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/piitaya">@piitaya</a>!</li>
<li>The add/edit area dialog has been improved and compacted. They are
much more pleasant to use now. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a>!</li>
<li>We now have a device class for the wind direction sensors! Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/edenhaus">@edenhaus</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jschlyter">@jschlyter</a> has added the energy distance device class for sensors,
which supports the following units: <code>kWh/100mi</code>, <code>kWh/100km</code>, and <code>mi/kWh</code>,
including conversion between them. Awesome!</li>
<li>Media player entities that support browsing media now have a new action
available to <a href="/integrations/media_player#action-media_playerbrowse_media">browse media as an action with a response</a>. Thanks, <a href="https:/github.com/PeteRager">@PeteRager</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rikroe">@rikroe</a> has added an action to <a href="/integrations/schedule#action-scheduleget_schedule">retrieve the configuration of a schedule
helper</a>. Thanks!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Iterating on the legends of graphs</h2>
<p>Last release, we made <a href="/blog/2025/02/05/release-20252/#preparing-our-graphs-for-the-future">quite a big change to the charts</a>
by replacing the software we use to make these graphs in Home Assistant. Things
changed behind the scenes, but our aim to start was to make it look
and feel similar.</p>
<p>However, we received a lot of feedback from the community that the legends shown
on the new graphs were suboptimal. Our UX and frontend teams have been working
hard to improve this situation and make the new graph legends more similar
to the old ones.</p>
<center>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="A screen recording showing expanding and collapsing the legend" src="/images/blog/2025-03/graph-legend.gif"/>
</center>
<p>By default, we show the legend below the graph and show as many data points
as possible. If there are too many, they will be displayed on demand using the
little ellipsis button.</p>
<p>When using these cards on your dashboard, if you want to always show the full
legend, a new option will allow you to keep it fully visible.</p>
<p>You can now also zoom in and out, by double clicking on a graph. If you want
more control over the range you want to view in your graph, you can press the
ctrl/cmd key and then select the range on the graph you want to zoom in on.</p>
<h2>Grouping/clustering of trackables on the maps</h2>
<p>The map card is perfect for visualizing your entities‚Äô locations, but when too
many cluster together in the same spot, it can get a bit cluttered.</p>
<p>To tackle this, we‚Äôve introduced marker clustering, which groups nearby entities
together, making it easier to see them at a glance. When zooming in, the markers
‚Äòspider‚Äô out, showing individual entity locations with a connecting line to
their original positions. You can temporarily disable clustering with a
simple toggle.</p>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a> and <a href="https://github.com/marcinbauer85">@marcinbauer85</a> for this awesome improvement!</p>

<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.3 in March.
These patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch
release every Friday.</p>

<p>Over the past several months, <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/">Music Assistant</a> has been hitting all the right notes with new features, greater stability, and a crescendo of contributors who keep pushing the project forward. If you‚Äôre <a href="/blog/2024/05/09/music-assistant-2/#what-is-music-assistant">unfamiliar with Music Assistant</a>, it allows you to merge your libraries from leading audio streaming providers and local files, letting you play them on the most popular smart speakers. Since our <a href="/blog/2024/05/09/music-assistant-2/">last update</a>, Music Assistant has had a couple of big releases, but our most recent might just be our platinum record üíø, with a lot of new functionality coming in version 2.4. In case you‚Äôve missed the last few updates, here are the biggest additions.</p>

<h3>‚ÄúSay My Name‚Äù</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">Optimized for Assist</h4>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/voice_ma.jpg' alt="audiobooks page"/>We should have called it Hi-Fi edition</p>
<p>The most recent release has some great advancements for <a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a> devices, like the <a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a>. We‚Äôve been working closely with the <a href="https://esphome.io/">ESPHome</a> team to ensure the most optimal audio streaming experience, which has helped make Assist devices into very capable media players. The community has even added some great functionality to fully <a href="https://github.com/music-assistant/voice-support">control your media player with your voice</a>, including choosing songs, artists, and more. Voice Preview Edition has a high-quality DAC that provides very clean audio playback from its 3.5mm jack, allowing you to stream lossless audio to connected speakers (this $59 device puts some of my expensive Hi-Fi gear to shame!).</p>
<h3>‚ÄúAcross the Universe‚Äù</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">External audio & Spotify Connect</h4>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/spotify_connect.jpg' alt="Spotify Connect on a Voice PE"/>Spotify Connect on Voice Preview Edition</p>
<p>Another feature in the latest release is support for ‚Äúexternal audio sources‚Äù, which can be provided either by players themselves (source control) or with plugins. The first plugin to deliver this functionality is Spotify Connect. It‚Äôs the easiest way to use Spotify with Music Assistant, and can be enabled on any player. This makes any Music Assistant supported device a Spotify Connect supported device (can confirm, Voice Preview Edition is great for this). <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/plugins/spotify-connect/">To get started</a> go to Music Assistant‚Äôs settings, add the Spotify Connect Plugin, choose the devices you would like it to use, and within Spotify you will see the device as a player. Just note, Spotify Connect requires a Premium account to work.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve got our sights set on adding even more plugins like this down the line (AirPlay, anyone?). We‚Äôre also hard at work making the whole setup process super simple, particularly for those using the Voice Preview Edition who might not need every single Music Assistant feature, but still want this simple casting capability.</p>
<h3>‚ÄúRadio Ga Ga‚Äù</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">Podcasts & Audiobooks</h4>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/audiobooks.png' alt="audiobooks page"/>The full book's progress is tracked, and chapters are clearly shown</p>
<p>Your library just got a whole lot bigger! Music Assistant now has native support for podcasts and audiobooks. For podcasts, several providers have been added, including <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/subsonic/">Subsonic</a>, <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/youtube-music/">YouTube</a>, and <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/podcastfeed/">RSS feeds</a>. Audiobooks can be added via two brand new providers: <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/audible/">Audible</a> and <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/audiobookshelf/">Audiobookshelf</a>, or imported directly from your local files. Audiobook playback presents the entire book as a single bar with dots showing each chapter (even if the book is separated into multiple files), allowing you to really track your progress. The entire core has been adjusted to keep better track of your progress through any media, so you will always resume where you left off.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/continue.png' alt="Continue listening section"/>The "Continue listening" section on the home page takes you back to where you left off</p>
<h3>‚ÄúNew Sensation‚Äù</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">More players and providers</h4>
<p>Shortly after our last blog post, we added support for <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> which was one of the most requested additions in the comments. A couple of other new providers were added, including <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/ibroadcast/">iBroadcast</a> and <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/siriusxm/">SiriusXM</a>. For new hardware support we‚Äôve added support for <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/player-support/bluesound/">Bluesound</a> players. If you have a provider or player you love and want to see it in Music Assistant, <a href="https://github.com/orgs/music-assistant/discussions?discussions_q=sort%3Atop">request it</a>‚Äîbut better yet <a href="https://github.com/music-assistant/server">join us in developing it</a>!</p>
<h3>‚ÄúAll About That Bass‚Äù</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">Equalizer control & features</h4>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/eq.png' alt="PEQ page"/>Make your own EQ settings or import pre-made settings for your speaker</p>
<p>When we released 2.0 there were basic bass and treble controls for devices, but with our new <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/audiopipeline/">configurable DSP</a> (Digital Signal Processor) you can now fine-tune your audio like never before. This includes input and output gain, along with a powerful <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/dsp/parametriceq/">parametric equalizer</a> that can be applied per player üìà. You can conveniently view the entire audio pipeline by clicking the quality indicator icon.</p>
<p><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/audio_path.png' alt="Music Assistants next big hit" class='no-shadow' /></p>
<p>Another useful feature added was a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/usage/#:~:text=Don%27t%20Stop%20The%20Music%20(DSTM)">Don‚Äôt stop the music</a>‚Äù mode that keeps music playing even once your queue finishes, playing similar songs from your library. Another way to keep the music playing is through lock screens and widget controls built into many popular operating systems, which can now control Music Assistant.</p>
<h3>‚ÄúMaster of Puppets‚Äù</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">Home Assistant improvements</h4>
<p>Home Assistant was always designed to work seamlessly with Music Assistant, and it‚Äôs only getting better. In the <a href="/blog/2024/12/04/release-202412/#new-integrations">Home Assistant 2024.12 release</a>, we gave the community a Christmas present‚ÄìMusic Assistant moved from HACS to being a native integration (<a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/integration/migrate/">please migrate if you haven‚Äôt yet</a>).</p>
<p>Many people now add all their players to Music Assistant first and then integrate Music Assistant with Home Assistant, eliminating the need to add each device separately. The most recent release added the ability to outsource any player control, including volume or turning it on/off, to a Home Assistant entity. There are other benefits to using them together, like Music Assistant <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/integration/announcements/">resuming audio playback</a> after an announcement or using Assist to find and play a song (<a href="https://github.com/music-assistant/voice-support">with or without LLMs</a>).</p>
<h3>‚ÄúD-D-Don‚Äôt Don‚Äôt Stop the Beat‚Äù</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">More stable streaming</h4>
<p>One of the biggest goals for every release is to improve streaming stability across all providers and players. With every release, we‚Äôve been improving stability, and since our last post, we‚Äôve had a big influx of users who have been finding and helping squash bugs. There have been nice improvements to almost every provider helping with stability, speed, and quality. Just in the next patch release 2.4.3, we‚Äôve improved streaming performance on slower network connections. The goal is that the music never stops.</p>
<h2>‚ÄúPraise You‚Äù - üôè</h2>

    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/02/27/apollo-joins-wwha</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-02-apollo/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Apollo wwha logo">
<p><a href="https://apolloautomation.com/">Apollo Automation</a> has joined the <a href="https://partner.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant</a> program. Certifying three of their newest devices, including their community favorite presence and air quality multisensors, giving users the best possible experience when using these devices with Home Assistant.</p>
<p>Notably, these are the first <a href="https://esphome.io/index.html">ESPHome</a>-based devices to receive Works with Home Assistant certification. Apollo is one of the first movers in an important trend that we‚Äôre very excited about: Home Assistant community members turning their open projects into viable businesses that support a thriving Open Home ecosystem.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Apollo Automation is a growing family-run business rooted in the Home Assistant and ESPHome communities. And yes, they‚Äôre named after their German Shepherd, Apollo üêï.</p>
<div class="alert">
    <p>Apollo Automation is built by and for the Home Assistant community. We believe in open smart home technology that gives users control, privacy, and flexibility. Joining the Works With Home Assistant program is a natural step for us, ensuring our devices integrate seamlessly while supporting the ecosystem we love. Home Assistant allows users to create powerful smart homes, and we are excited to contribute by making high-quality, reliable hardware that enhances the experience for everyone.</p>
    <em style="text-align: right; display: block;">- Justin Bunton, Co-Founder, Apollo Automation</em>
</div>
<p>Two years ago, they started sharing their designs for a new impressively small ESPHome-powered multisensor with the community. Getting feedback, sharing iterations, and working collaboratively, they turned that sensor into a full-fledged product, which was built to work with Home Assistant. They have continued this open, community-first approach and have now built several even more refined multisensors.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-02-apollo/multisensor.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Apollo MSR-2 multisensor">
A multisensor for ants? üêú</p>
<p>Home Assistant is the <a href="https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/true-platforms-let-you-create/">only true smart home platform</a> because it gives everyone full control to build and create. <a href="/integrations/esphome/">ESPHome</a> is the ultimate smart device platform, and it is fostering an entirely new ecosystem of Open Home projects. ESPHome works fully locally, and it‚Äôs a modder‚Äôs paradise, allowing users to build DIY smart home devices (check out the <a href="https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html">getting started with ESPHome guide</a>).</p>
<p>Creators can also use it to build pre-built, plug-and-play products that give users a really seamless experience. With devices being discovered and easily added to your Wi-Fi network and Home Assistant, along with a one-click update within Home Assistant.</p>
<p>ESPHome and Home Assistant allows anyone to turn their passion for building cool things into a career, and the things they build help support a more vibrant Open Home. Apollo is an exciting new partner for the Works with Home Assistant program and should serve as an inspiration to all aspiring makers in our community.</p>
<h2>Devices</h2>
<p>Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates, while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, and it is the support of <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers that funds this work.</p>
<p>Apollo has chosen first to certify three products, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://apolloautomation.com/products/mtr-1">MTR-1 Multi-Target Radar Multisensor For Home Assistant (LD2450)</a> - A tiny, but powerful radar-based (mmWave) presence sensor that can pack in many other sensors.</li>
<li><a href="https://apolloautomation.com/products/msr-2">MSR-2 mmWave Multisensor For Home Assistant (LD2410B)</a> - An even smaller multisensor that is the successor of the initial community feedback-driven design.</li>
<li><a href="https://apolloautomation.com/products/air-1">AIR-1 Air Quality Sensor For Home Assistant</a> - A small air quality multisensor that can be extended to incorporate a huge variety of sensors.</li>
</ul>
<p>We anticipate that Apollo will bring more of their lineup into the program, and we are excited to see their new innovations going forward! This is just the start of a year of many new Works with Home Assistant announcements, so please stay tuned!</p>

    <link href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/02/13/voice-chapter-9-speech-to-phrase/"/>

<p><strong>Welcome to Voice chapter 9 üéâ part of our <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/categories/assist/">long-running series</a> following the development of open voice.</strong></p>
<p>We‚Äôre still pumped from the launch of the <a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a> at the end of December. It sold out 23 minutes into our announcement - wow! We‚Äôve been working hard to keep it in stock at <a href="/voice-pe#buy">all our distributors</a>.</p>
<p>Today, we have a lot of cool stuff to improve your experience with Voice PE or any other Assist satellite you‚Äôre using. This includes fully local and offline voice control that can be powered by nearly any Home Assistant system.</p>

<p>Dragon NaturallySpeaking was a popular speech recognition program introduced in 1997. To run this software you needed at least a 133 MHz Pentium processor, 32 MB of RAM, and Windows 95 or later. Nearly thirty years later, Speech-to-Text is much better, but needs orders of magnitude more resources.</p>
<p>Incredible technologies are being developed in speech processing, but it‚Äôs currently unrealistic for a device that costs less than $100 to take real advantage of them. It‚Äôs possible, of course, but running the previously recommended Speech-to-Text tool, <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">Whisper</a>, on a Raspberry Pi 4 takes at least 5 seconds to turn your speech into text, with varying levels of success. This is why we ended up recommending at least an Intel N100 to run your voice assistant fully locally. That stung. Our opt-in analytics shows over <a href="https://analytics.home-assistant.io/">50% of the Home Assistant OS users</a> are running their homes on affordable, low-powered machines like the <a href="/green">Home Assistant Green</a> or a Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs more, advancing the development of Whisper is largely in the hands of OpenAI, as we don‚Äôt have the resources required to add languages to that tool. We could add every possible language to Home Assistant, but if any single part of our voice pipeline lacks language support, it renders voice unusable for that language. As a result, many widely spoken languages were unsupported for local voice control.</p>
<p>This left many users unable to use voice to control their smart home without purchasing extra hardware or services. We‚Äôre changing this today with the launch of a key new piece of our voice pipeline.</p>
<h2>Voice for the masses</h2>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-02-voice-chapter-9/stp-logo.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Speech-to-Phrase logo">
<p><a href="https://github.com/OHF-voice/speech-to-phrase">Speech-to-Phrase</a> is based on old, almost ancient, voice technology by today‚Äôs standards. Instead of the ability to transcribe virtually any speech into text, it is limited to a set of pre-trained phrases. Speech-to-Phrase will automatically generate the phrases and fine-tune a model based on the devices, areas, and sentence triggers in your Home Assistant server - 100% locally and offline.</p>
<p><strong>The result:</strong> speech transcribed in under a second on a Home Assistant Green or Raspberry Pi 4. The Raspberry Pi 5 processes commands seven times faster, clocking in at 150 milliseconds per command!</p>
<p>With great speed comes <em>some</em> limitations. Speech-to-Phrase only supports a subset of Assist‚Äôs voice commands, and more open-ended things like shopping lists, naming a timer, and broadcasts are not usable out of the box. Really any commands that can accept random words (wildcards) will not work. For the same reasons, Speech-to-Phrase is intended for home control only and not LLMs.</p>
<p>The most important home control commands are supported, including turning lights on and off, changing brightness and color, getting the weather, setting timers, and controlling media players. <a href="/docs/automation/trigger/#sentence-trigger">Custom sentences</a> can also be added to trigger things not covered by the current commands, and we expect the community will come up with some clever new ways to use this tech.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-02-voice-chapter-9/green-pe.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Green and Voice PE join forces">
<p align="center"><em>All you need to get started with voice</em></p>
<p>Speech-to-Phrase is launching with support for English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, and Italian - covering nearly 70% of Home Assistant users. Nice. Unlike the local Speech-to-Text tools currently available, adding languages to Speech-to-Phrase is much easier. This means many more languages will be available in future releases, and <a href="/voice_control/contribute-voice">we would love your help</a> adding them!</p>
<p>We‚Äôre working on updating the Voice wizard to include Speech-to-Phrase. Until then, you need to install the add-on manually:</p>
<p><a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=core_speech-to-phrase"><img src='https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_addon.svg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="!Open your Home Assistant instance and show the dashboard of an add-on."></a></p>
<h2>Building an Open Voice Ecosystem</h2>
<p>When we launched Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition, we didn‚Äôt just launch a product; we kickstarted an ecosystem. We did this by open-sourcing all parts and ensuring that the voice experience built into Home Assistant is not tied to a single product. Any voice assistant built for the Open Home ecosystem can take advantage of all this work. Even your DIY ones!</p>
<p>With ESPHome 2025.2, which we‚Äôre releasing next week, any ESPHome-based voice assistant will support making <a href="/blog/2025/02/05/release-20252/#new-broadcast-intent">broadcasts</a> (more on that below), and they will also be able to use our new voice wizard to ensure new users have everything they need to get started.</p>
<p>This will include updates for the <a href="/voice_control/thirteen-usd-voice-remote/">$13 Atom Echo</a> and ESP32-S3-Box-3 devices that we used for development during the Year of the Voice!</p>
<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid="HMqXHN0KBQM" videotitle="New broadcast feature in action with Atom and Box 3"></lite-youtube>New broadcast feature in action with Atom and Box 3</p>
<h2>Large language model improvements</h2>
<p>We aim for Home Assistant to be <a href="/blog/2024/06/07/ai-agents-for-the-smart-home/">the place for experimentation with AI in the smart home</a>. We support a wide range of models, both local and cloud-based, and are constantly improving the different ways people can interact with them. We‚Äôre always running <a href="https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports">benchmarks</a> to track the best models, and make sure our changes lead to an improved experience.</p>
<p>If you set up <a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a>, Home Assistant‚Äôs built-in voice assistant, and configure it to use an LLM, you might have noticed some new features landing recently. One major change was the new ‚Äú<a href="/blog/2024/12/04/release-202412/#let-your-voice-assistant-fall-back-to-an-llm-based-agent">prefer handling commands locally</a>‚Äù setting, which always attempts to run commands with the built-in conversation agent before it sends it off to an LLM. We noticed many easy-to-run commands were being sent to an LLM, which can slow down things and waste tokens. If Home Assistant understands the command (e.g., turn on the lights), it will perform the necessary action, and only passes it on to your chosen LLM if it doesn‚Äôt understand the command (e.g., what‚Äôs the air quality like now).</p>
<p>Adding the above features made us realize that LLMs need to understand the commands handled locally. Now, the <a href="/blog/2025/02/05/release-20252/#shared-history-between-the-default-conversation-agent-and-its-llm-based-fallback">conversation history is shared</a> with the LLM. The context allows you to ask the LLM for follow-up questions that refer to recent commands, regardless of whether they helped process the request.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-02-voice-chapter-9/shared-history.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Speech-to-Phrase logo">
<p align="center"><em>Left: without shared conversations. Right: Shared conversations enable GPT to understand context.</em></p>
<h3>Reducing the time to first word with streaming<!-- omit in toc --></h3>
<p>When experimenting with larger models, or on slower hardware, LLM‚Äôs can feel sluggish. They only respond once the entire reply is generated, which can take frustratingly long for lengthy responses (you‚Äôll be waiting a while if you ask it to tell you an epic fairy tale).</p>
<p>In Home Assistant 2025.3 we‚Äôre introducing support for LLMs to stream their response to the chat, allowing users to start reading while the response is being generated. A bonus side effect is that commands are now also faster: they will be executed as soon as they come in, without waiting for the rest of the message to be complete.</p>
<p>Streaming is coming initially for Ollama and OpenAI.</p>
<h3>Model Context Protocol brings Home Assistant to every AI<!-- omit in toc --></h3>
<p>In November 2024, Anthropic announced the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction">Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP). It is a new protocol to allow LLMs to control external services. In this release, contributed by <a href="https://github.com/allenporter">Allen Porter</a>, Home Assistant can speak MCP.</p>
<p>Using the new Model Context Protocol <a href="/integrations/mcp">integration</a>, Home Assistant can integrate external MCP servers and make their tools available to LLMs that Home Assistant talks to (for your voice assistant or in automations). There is <a href="https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers">quite a collection of MCP servers</a>, including wild ones like scraping websites (<a href="https://gist.github.com/allenporter/b0e9946feb2ab60901c4f467ac1ba6f9">tutorial</a>), file server access, or even BlueSky.</p>
<p>With the new Model Context Protocol <a href="/integrations/mcp_server">server integration</a>, Home Assistant‚Äôs LLM tools can be included in other AI apps, like the Claude desktop app (<a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user">tutorial</a>). If agentic AI takes off, your smart home will be ready to be integrated.</p>
<p>Thanks Allen!</p>
<h2>Expanding Voice Capabilities</h2>
<p>We keep enhancing the capabilities of the built-in conversation agent of Home Assistant. With the latest release, we‚Äôre unlocking two new features:</p>
<h4>‚ÄúBroadcast that it‚Äôs time for dinner‚Äù<!-- omit in toc --></h4>
<p>The new <a href="/blog/2025/02/05/release-20252/#new-broadcast-intent">broadcast</a> feature lets you quickly send messages to the other Assist satellites in your home. This makes it possible to announce it‚Äôs time for dinner, or announce battles between your children üòÖ.</p>
<h4>‚ÄúSet the temperature to 19 degrees‚Äù<!-- omit in toc --></h4>
<p>Previously Assist could only tell you the temperature, but now it can help you change the temperature of your HVAC system. Perfect for changing the temperature while staying cozy under a warm blanket.</p>
<h2>Home Assistant phones home: analog phones are back!</h2>
<p>Two years ago, we introduced the <a href="/voice_control/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/">world‚Äôs most private voice assistant</a>: an analog phone! Users can pick it up to talk to their smart home, and only the user can hear the response. A fun feature we‚Äôre adding today is that Home Assistant can now <strong>call your analog phone!</strong></p>
<p>Analog phones are great when you want to notify a room, instead of an entire home. For instance, when the laundry is done, you can notify someone in the living room, but not the office. Also since the user needs to pick up the horn to receive the call, you will know if your notification was received.</p>
<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid="TaoNY1gINWc" videotitle="Have your Home Assistant give you a call"></lite-youtube>Have your Home Assistant give you a call</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre using an LLM as your voice assistant, you can also start a conversation from a phone call. You can provide the opening sentence and via a new ‚Äúextra system prompt‚Äù option, provide extra context to the LLM to interpret the response from the user. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>Extra system context: garage door cover.garage_door was left open for 30 minutes. We asked the user if it should be closed</li>
<li>Assistant: should the garage door be closed?</li>
<li>User: sure</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://github.com/jaminh">JaminH</a> for the contribution.</p>
<h2>Wyoming improvements</h2>
<p>Wyoming is our standard for linking together all the different parts needed to build a voice assistant. Home Assistant 2025.3 will add support for announcements to Wyoming satellites, making them eligible for the new broadcast feature too.¬†¬†</p>
<p>We‚Äôre also adding a new microWakeWord add-on (the same wake word engine running on Voice PE!) that can be used as an alternative to openWakeWord. As we collect more real-world samples from our <a href="https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/">Wake Word Collective</a>, the models included in microWakeWord will be retrained and improved.</p>
<h2>ü´µ Help us bring choice to voice!</h2>
<p>We‚Äôve said it before, and we‚Äôll say it again‚Äîthe era of open voice has begun, and the more people who join us, the better it gets. Home Assistant offers many ways to start with voice control, whether by <a href="/voice_control/#expand-and-experiment">building your own</a> Assist hardware or getting a <a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a>. With every update, you‚Äôll see new features, and you‚Äôll get to preview the future of voice today.</p>
<p>A huge thanks to all the language leaders and contributors helping to shape open voice in the home! There are many ways to get involved, from translating or sharing voice samples to building new features‚Äîlearn more about how <a href="/voice_control/contribute-voice">you can contribute here</a>. Another great way to support development is by subscribing to <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a>, which helps fund the Open Home projects that power voice.</p>

<p>In the previous release, we <a href="/blog/2025/01/03/release-20251/#overhaul-of-the-backup-system">overhauled our backup system</a>,
and the response was overwhelming! Tons of suggestions and feature requests
came in, so this release is‚Äîonce again‚Äîfocused on backups. Based on this
community feedback, we‚Äôve added loads of improvements, including the first
integrations to store your backups in <strong>Google Drive</strong>
and <strong>Microsoft OneDrive</strong>!</p>
<p>This release also brings exciting new features to <strong>Voice</strong>! Home Assistant can
now call your <strong>analog phone</strong>, and when dinner is ready, you can <strong>broadcast</strong>
that message to all voice assistants in your home! But wait‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs more!</p>
<p>On <strong>February 12, 2025</strong>, we‚Äôre streaming live on YouTube all about Voice:

<h2>Iterating on backups</h2>
<p>In the previous release, we <a href="/blog/2025/01/03/release-20251/#overhaul-of-the-backup-system">fully revamped the entire backup experience</a>
and added many new features to make it easier to use. That release set the
stage for the next iterations and opened up the ability for integrations to
provide locations to store backups.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve received <strong>a lot</strong> of feedback on the new backup system, which is awesome! ‚ù§Ô∏è
All the feedback helped us prioritize the most requested features, and other
improvements to the backup system.</p>
<p>This release includes a lot of the most requested improvements and abilities.</p>
<h3>Unencrypted backups</h3>
<p>The new backup system came with a lot of security improvements, including
encryption of backups. However, as it turns out, many users use these backups
to extract and restore single files or configurations, a use case in which
encryption made things more difficult. In this release we made two changes
to the backup system to address this.</p>
<h4>Ability to turn off encryption for specific locations</h4>
<p>While our default recommendation remains to encrypt backups, as of this
release, you can turn off encryption on a per location basis. This allows you
to store backups on you local NAS, for example, in an unencrypted format.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the option to turn off encryption for a specific backup location." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-turn-off-encryption.png" />
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup locations, one location indicates that encryption has been turned off." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-encryption-turned-off.png" />
<p>There is one exception to this, which is <a href="/cloud">Home Assistant Cloud</a>. Backups
stored in Home Assistant Cloud will always be encrypted, and encryption cannot
be turned off. At Nabu Casa, we take your privacy and security very seriously,
and we never ever want to be able to access your data.</p>
<h4>Downloading backups unencrypted</h4>
<p>When downloading backups from the Home Assistant interface, you will now always
download the backup in an unencrypted format that can be extracted using your
favorite archive tool.</p>
<p>This works for all backups, regardless of the encryption settings of the
location in which they are stored. For instance, if you download an encrypted
backup from Home Assistant Cloud through the Home Assistant interface,
it will decrypt the backup on the fly while you download it.</p>
<h3>Customize the time of your backups</h3>
<p>The initial iteration of the backup system scheduled backups to run at 4:45 AM,
but this time wasn‚Äôt ideal for everyone. Some, for example, turned off their
network storage during the night, meaning the backup would fail.</p>
<p>This release, we added the ability to customize the time of your backups to your
liking. Additionally, if you choose to make weekly backups, you can now select
the days of the week you want the backup to run.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup configuration options, you can now set your own time and select which days to backup." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-customize-backups-change.png" />
<h3>Taking backups on an advanced schedule</h3>
<p>The above backup time changes not flexible enough for you? Well, you are in luck! In this
release, we added an action (<code>backup.create_automatic</code>) that you can use
to trigger a backup, with your preferred settings, in an automation.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing an automation in the automation editor that is using the new action to create an automated backup." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-action.png" />
<p>This allows you to create automated backups on any schedule you like, or even
add conditions and actions around it. For example, you could make an automation
that triggers on a calendar, wakes up your network storage, waits till it is
online, and then starts a backup.</p>
<h3>Re-introduction of the backup toggle on update</h3>
<p>If you run Home Assistant OS, you get updates for Home Assistant along with
all your add-ons. The update dialog used to have a toggle to create a backup
before updating, which was removed in the previous release.</p>
<p>This change was made because this feature was considered redundant when running
regular automated backups. However, we‚Äôve received a lot of feedback that many
people relied on these backups to ensure they had the latest data, for instance,
if they needed to roll back to a previous version of an add-on. We are
re-introducing this backup on update toggle in this release, but in a smarter
way. ü§ì</p>
<h4>Backup on updating Home Assistant</h4>
<p>When updating Home Assistant, the toggle is now turned off by default and
shows the last time you made a backup. This allows you to decide whether to make
a new backup before updating.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing an Home Assistant Core update dialog, giving the option to make a backup before update." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-before-update-core.png" />
<p>If you turn the switch on, a full automated backup is created and synced to
your configured locations, before the update is started.</p>
<p>This full sync is done to ensure you have the most recent backup available in
case the update causes issues and you need to restore your system. In the rare
case a Home Assistant update fatally fails and you can‚Äôt access the backup page,
if you‚Äôve configured a second backup location, you‚Äôll be able to download it
from there.</p>
<h4>Backup on updating add-ons</h4>
<p>Things are slightly different when updating add-ons. The toggle exists here too,
and is disabled by default. However, when you enable it, only a backup of your
add-on and its data is created. That way you can keep around the previous
version of the add-on, so you can always roll back to it if needed.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing an Home Assistant add-on update dialog, giving the option to make a backup before update." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-addons-before-update.png" />
<p>To prevent your system from filling up with old add-on backups, we only retain
one backup per add-on, automatically deleting the previous backup whenever
a new one is created. Add-on backups you created manually, of course,
remain untouched and will not be deleted automatically.</p>
<h3>Improved filenames for backups</h3>
<p>One piece of feedback we‚Äôve seen a lot, is that the filenames created by backups
can be a bit cryptic and hard to understand for humans.</p>
<p>This feedback was fair, as the filename was a hash and originally not designed
to be human-readable. This method was not newly introduced in the last release,
but it was made more apparent with the new backup system and locations.</p>
<p>So, in this release, we‚Äôve improved the filenames of the backups stored on your
backup locations. The filename now includes the date and time the backup was
created, making it easier to understand and identify the backup you are looking
for, even outside of Home Assistant.</p>
<h3>New locations</h3>
<p>This release also introduces new locations to store your backups. There are new
integrations for <a href="/integrations/google_drive/">Google Drive</a> and
<a href="/integrations/onedrive/">Microsoft OneDrive</a>, and backup support was added to
the <a href="/integrations/synology_dsm">Synology DSM</a> integration.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup configuration panel, with all possible backup integrations set up!" src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-new-locations.png" />
<h2>Voice</h2>
<p>Assist, our <a href="/voice_control/">private voice assistant</a>, is getting a few new
features in this release. If you don‚Äôt have Assist set up yet, check out our
<a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice: Preview Edition</a> to get started.</p>
<h3>Home Assistant will be able to call your analog phone to tell you a message</h3>
<p>Remember our tutorial on turning an analog phone into the
<a href="/voice_control/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/">world‚Äôs most private voice assistant</a>?
Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jaminh">Jamin</a>, we now have a way to call
your analog phone from Home Assistant!</p>
<p>You can use <a href="/integrations/assist_satellite#action-assist_satelliteannounce"><code>assist_satellite.announce</code></a>
to have Home Assistant call your phone and play a message when someone picks up
the phone.</p>
<p>If you use an LLM as the brains for your voice assistant, you can take this one
step further with the new <a href="/integrations/assist_satellite#action-assist_satellitestart_conversation"><code>assist_satellite.start_conversation</code></a>
action. Instead of playing an announcement, it starts a conversation between
Home Assistant and the user, with Home Assistant saying the first message.
Left the garage door open for 30 minutes? No problem, let Home Assistant call
and ask if they want to close it.</p>
<p><em>(Starting a conversation with the default conversation agent is a bit more work
and did not make it this release).</em></p>
<h3>New Broadcast intent</h3>
<p>You can now broadcast messages to every other voice assistant in your home.
Try it by saying <em>‚ÄúBroadcast it is time for dinner‚Äù</em>.
As always with new intents, support may vary
<a href="https://ohf-voice.github.io/intents/">depending on your language</a>,
but our language leaders are working hard on making sure it will be supported
soon in your language!</p>
<h3>Setting Temperature on Thermostat</h3>
<p>A few releases ago we introduced an intent to get the current temperature from
a climate device. As of this release, you can also set the target temperature
of your thermostat by voice.</p>
<p>By saying <em>‚ÄúSet the temperature to 19 degrees‚Äù</em> this will smartly target the
area you are in (if you have a thermostat per area, such as thermostatic valves
on your radiators) or the floor you are in (if you only have a central unit).
You can also target specific devices by name if you prefer.</p>
<h3>LLMs meet calendars</h3>
<p>Without complex custom tooling, LLM-based conversation agents previously could
not fetch events from your calendar. This release changes that. Out of the box,
LLM-based agents can now retrieve today‚Äôs and this week‚Äôs events from any of
your calendars. Don‚Äôt forget to
<a href="/voice_control/voice_remote_expose_devices/">expose your calendar entities</a>
to enable this functionality.</p>
<h3>Shared history between the default conversation agent and its LLM-based fallback</h3>
<p>In <a href="/blog/2024/12/04/release-202412/">2024.12</a> we introduced a lovely feature
that allowed you to use our fast and local default conversation agent for most
queries while still being able to fall back to a much more powerful LLM-based
agent for more complex queries.</p>
<p>This introduced some interesting behaviors. From a user perspective, it looked
like you were talking to the same assistant, whereas, in reality, nothing was
shared between the two agents. This led to some less-than-optimal scenarios,
such as this one:</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of missing history in the conversation" src="/images/blog/2025-02/conversation-history-before.png" />
<p>The first command is processed locally by our default agent, but the follow-up
request is processed by the LLM-based agent. Since no memory is shared, it does
not understand what device you want to turn off.</p>
<p>Starting with this release, both agents now share the same command history,
helping address this issue.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new improved behavior" src="/images/blog/2025-02/conversation-history-after.png" />
<h3>Model Context Protocol</h3>
<p>This release adds the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction">Model Context Protocol</a>
to Home Assistant thanks to <a href="https://github.com/allenporter">Allen</a>. Home Assistant can both be an
<a href="/integrations/mcp_server/">MCP server</a> and an
<a href="/integrations/mcp/">MCP client</a>. From the MCP website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To give it a try yourself, <a href="https://gist.github.com/allenporter/b0e9946feb2ab60901c4f467ac1ba6f9">check out this client demo</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Bluetooth config panel</h2>
<p>The <a href="/integrations/bluetooth">Bluetooth integration</a> now has its own configuration panel! üíô</p>
<p>The panel is accessible by going to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Device &amp; services</strong>. Find
and select the <strong>Bluetooth</strong> integration, and next select <strong>Configure</strong>.</p>
<p>This new panel gives you access to the Bluetooth integration options and
insights into the connection slot allocations. More importantly,
it has an advertisement monitor!</p>
<p>Selecting <strong>Advertisement monitor</strong> will open a new panel, where you can see
information about your Bluetooth devices, including the raw advertisement data
and how they are connected to your Home Assistant instance. This includes
which <a href="/integrations/bluetooth/#remote-adapters-bluetooth-proxies">Bluetooth proxy</a> it connects through!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new advertisement panel" src="/images/blog/2025-02/bluetooth-panel.png" />
<h2>Preparing our graphs for the future</h2>
<p>This release includes a major overhaul of every graph we display and show in
Home Assistant. We have entirely replaced the software library that renders
these graphs in the frontend.</p>
<p>You can most definitely tell things have changed, but everything still looks
very similar. The latter was our goal for now, as we wanted the existing
experience to be familiar.</p>
<p>However, this change is a preparation for the future. We have many plans and
ideas for our graphs, and this change was a necessary step to make those plans
possible.</p>
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.2 in February.
These patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch
release every Friday.</p>

unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.</p>
<p>We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:</p>

    <updated>2025-01-03T00:00:01+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-01-backups/art.jpg' alt="3 2 1 backup">
<p>Home Assistant is a powerful tool that can save you time and money by automating your home. Pretty important things around the home, from heating to an automatic fish feeder, need to depend on it. However, as your setup grows more complex, maintaining it‚Äîwhat we call <em>‚Äúdigital housekeeping‚Äù</em>‚Äîcan become a time-consuming task. Backups are a critical part of this maintenance, yet they‚Äôre often overlooked, especially by new users, often until it is too late when disaster strikes.</p>
<p>To make backups effortless, we‚Äôve introduced new automated and off-site backup features in <a href="/blog/2025/01/03/release-20251/">the latest release of Home Assistant</a>. These improvements will make it easier than ever to safeguard your setup. As we step into the New Year, we would encourage you to adopt a simple yet crucial resolution: regularly back up your data. With our new tools, it takes just five minutes to set up and provides lasting peace of mind.</p>
<p>Learn more about our backups below, or get started now by <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/updates/">updating</a> and visiting the <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/backup/">backups</a> page.</p>

<h2>What‚Äôs in a backup?</h2>
<p>Backups are essential for a reliable smart home. They protect your system from hardware failures, natural disasters, and cyberattacks, allowing you to quickly restore operations. A solid backup strategy follows the 3-2-1 rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 copies of your data</li>
<li>2 stored on different media</li>
<li>1 kept off-site</li>
</ul>
<p>While this may seem excessive, consider a scenario like a lightning strike: both your Home Assistant system and any local storage, like network-attached storage (NAS), could be destroyed. That‚Äôs why an off-site backup is non-negotiable for true resilience, and a comprehensive backup strategy should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular and frequent backups of critical data</li>
<li>Following the 3-2-1 rule for redundancy</li>
<li>Encrypting backups to protect against theft and corruption</li>
<li>Testing backups to ensure they are functional</li>
<li>Defining how long backups should be retained</li>
</ul>
<p>To support these best practices, we have worked hard to introduce Automatic Backups and seamless integration with off-site backup location providers, such as <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a>. These updates, part of <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#home-assistant-cloud-peace-of-mind">our 2024 roadmap</a>, make it easier than ever to provide peace of mind to our users, by implementing a robust backup strategy, and keep your smart home running smoothly.</p>
<h2>Backups have never been this easy</h2>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-01-backups/backups.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="the backup page">
<p>Home Assistant backups are incredibly good, backing up every setting and add-on, making restores feel a bit like magic. It even works across different CPU architectures! Up until recently setting up a 3-2-1 backup strategy in Home Assistant was not entirely straightforward. This changes with Home Assistant 2025.1, where we‚Äôre elevating our backup experience with three new important features.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic encrypted backups</strong> - You can now schedule automatic backups every night or once a week, ensuring you always have a recent backup at hand.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic cleanup</strong> - No longer worry about backups overrunning your disk space, as you can now set the maximum number of backups that should be stored.</li>
<li><strong>Backup locations</strong> - We have added a new system for integrations to provide backup locations (also known as <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/platform/backup">backup agents</a>), allowing you to sync backups to both local or off-site storage. It‚Äôs launching with support for <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/storage/">network shares</a> and <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> (included at no additional cost to subscribers), with more locations to follow.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Get started with our Backup Wizard</h3>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-01-backups/wizard.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="the backup wizard">
<p>The new automatic backup feature in Home Assistant 2025.1 comes with a new easy to use backup wizard. With a couple of clicks, you can backup your Home Assistant system on a regular schedule and easily choose the places where backups are stored. New users will be prompted with a wizard to make sure they set up automatic encrypted backups. Selecting the recommended settings ensures that a backup is made every night, that three backups are kept, and that they are uploaded to all available locations.</p>
<h3>Backup locations</h3>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-01-backups/locations.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="backup locations">
<p>At launch, only a few backup locations will be available, but we‚Äôve made it easy for developers to integrate more, so expect a lot of options to follow. As part of this renewed focus on smart home resilience set out in <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#next-priority-encrypted-cloud-backup">our roadmap</a>, cloud backup has been added to <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a>, which will be available day one to all subscribers for no additional cost. It will only store the latest backup, which must be under 5GB (you‚Äôll be notified to repair it if it is too large to upload). If you lose your other backups, you can always go to <a href="https://account.nabucasa.com/">your Cloud account page</a> and download the latest backup.</p>
<p>New Home Assistant features like this supercharged backup capability is only possible with funding from our Home Assistant Cloud subscribers. Adding backup to the subscription at no additional cost, was the least we could do to thank them for their continued support.</p>
<h3>Secure by default</h3>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-01-backups/encrypt.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Encryption key page">
<p>Backups contain all Home Assistant data, including all the keys to every integrated device in your smart home and the history of how you live your life. This data is very important to keep secure. With automatic backups and the 3-2-1 approach we are promoting to users to store their backups off-site. This is why all automatic backups are fully encrypted.</p>
<p>When a user configures automatic backups, they will be presented with the encryption key and the option to download an emergency kit. The emergency kit contains all the important information, including a link to <a href="/more-info/backup-emergency-kit">the instructions on how to use it to restore a backup</a>. If you were to ever delete your emergency kit, it is available to re-download in the <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/backup/">backup configuration page</a>.</p>
<h4>Apply 3-2-1 to your backups</h4>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="nSSkMVBqChM" videotitle="How to setup automatic backups"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>Check out the above video tutorial or read our docs to learn more about setting up <a href="/integrations/backup/">automatic and off-site backups</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Too often, people just starting their smart home journey move forward a little too fast and make a mistake that causes some downtime. This impacts the household‚Äôs confidence, as something that should be making their lives easier is actually seen as unreliable. Avoid this early pitfall and build a resilient smart home with 3-2-1 backups.</p>

<h2>Overhaul of the backup system</h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs talk about backups. Let‚Äôs be honest: they‚Äôre one of the most important yet
often overlooked tasks. But when disaster strikes, like a hardware failure,
having a reliable backup can save the day. Wouldn‚Äôt you love to be back up and
running after disaster strikes?</p>
<p>While Home Assistant‚Äôs previous backup system has proven to be solid
and reliable over the years, it didn‚Äôt exactly make following best
practices‚Äîlike regular backups, encryption, and off-site
storage‚Äîeasy. Many of you had to rely on custom add-ons, automations,
or blueprints for backups to fill the gaps.</p>
<p><strong>That changes with this release! üéâ</strong></p>
<p>We‚Äôve completely reworked the Home Assistant backup experience to help you set
up a solid backup strategy, using best practices in just a few clicks;
giving you peace of mind when it comes to your backups.</p>
<p>No worries, if you are using any custom solution for backups, they will continue
to work today. Even with everything new, we‚Äôve made sure to keep everything
backward compatible.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let‚Äôs dive into the new backup system!</p>
<h3>Automated backups ü§ñ</h3>
<p>Yes, you read that right‚ÄîHome Assistant now supports automated backups!</p>
<p>Using a schedule, backups will be created on a regular basis without you having
to lift a finger. This ensures you always have a recent backup available,
without having to worry about it.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the bew backup overview page which shows you exactly when your last backup took place" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-status.png" />
<p>When you navigate to your backups in the settings menu, you will be
greeted with a new overview page that shows you exactly when your last backup
took place and when the next one is scheduled. Instant peace of mind!</p>
<p>Automated backups are taking place at 4:45 AM. So, while everyone in your home
is sleeping, Home Assistant makes sure your data is safe and sound. Backing up
at this early hour also means Home Assistant is done with its internal database
maintenance, ensuring your backup is as compact as possible.</p>
<p>If something ever goes wrong during the automated scheduled backup process,
Home Assistant will notify you through the repair center, ensuring you are
aware of it and can take action.</p>
<h3>Triggering an off-schedule automated backup üëÜ</h3>
<p>Automated backups on a schedule are great, but sometimes, you might want to
trigger a backup¬†<strong>right now</strong>! Maybe you are about to make big changes or
upgrade a whole bunch of things during an evening of tinkering.</p>
<p>No worries! You can now trigger an off-schedule automated backup from the backup
page at any time. This will immediately create a backup with the same
configuration as your scheduled automated backups.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup now button + dialog that allows you to trigger an off-schedule backup at any time" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-backup-now.png" />
<p>The ability to trigger an on-demand automated backup is excellent, as it covers
all your backup settings in a single click. However, the ability to create
manual backups also still exists. This allows you to create a very specific
backup with the exact contents you want to have in it.</p>
<h3>Home Assistant Cloud backups üòé</h3>
<p>Are you a <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/">Home Assistant Cloud by Nabu Casa</a> subscriber? Then you‚Äôre in for a
treat! You can now automatically store your latest, fully encrypted, backup in
your Home Assistant Cloud account.</p>
<p><strong>This feature provides 5GB of storage at no extra cost, offering fully
encrypted off-site protection for your data! üéÅ</strong></p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Home Assistant Cloud is now a backup target location, that is included with the Home Assistant Cloud subscription at no additional costs" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-home-assistant-cloud.png" />
<p>The backup can be downloaded from Home Assistant itself, but also from the
<a href="https://account.nabucasa.com/">Home Assistant Cloud account page</a> @ Nabu Casa
in case you need it. This way, you can always access your latest backup, even
in case your Home Assistant hardware completely fails.</p>
<h3>Backup locations are extendable by design üß©</h3>
<p>So, automated backups can be stored on your local disk and in Home Assistant
Cloud, but what if you want to store your backups somewhere else?</p>
<p>Choice is an important aspect of Home Assistant; we want to make everything as
flexible as possible without vendor lock-in. Therefore, the backup system
is designed to be <strong>extendable</strong>.</p>
<p>This means <strong>integrations</strong> can offer new storage locations‚Äîsuch as NAS devices,
Google Drive, Backblaze B2, or other storage providers‚Äîin the future.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing an potential example storage provider provided by an integration" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-integration-location.png" />
<p>Currently, this feature is brand new ‚ú®, so <strong>no</strong> integrations offer additional
locations yet. However, we expect to see a few more integrations that provide
backup locations in the next release.</p>
<p>This extensibility ensures you can store your backups where you want them,
giving you the flexibility and choice to choose the storage solution you
prefer and trust.</p>
<h3>Encrypted backups by default üîí</h3>
<p>With the addition of Home Assistant Cloud as an off-site backup location, and
the potential for integrations to offer even more (off-site) backup locations,
security has become more important than ever. Your backups not only contain the
access credentials to your smart home devices but also the history of your home,
and no one should be able to access information that sensitive! <strong>Ever!</strong></p>
<p>That is why all backups are now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-128</a> encrypted by default. To prioritize
your backups‚Äô security we replaced the previous optional password
with a mandatory encryption key.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="The new backup overview page shows you exactly when your last backup took place" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-encryption.png" />
<p>When you set up your backups for the first time, an encryption key will be
generated for you. Make sure to store this key in a safe place, as you will need
it to restore your backups. To make this easier, you can download the key as
part of an emergency kit during setup‚Äîor anytime later from the backup settings
page. Keep it safe! üîë</p>
<h3>Restoring backups available to all installation methods ü§ó</h3>
<p>More good news‚Äîrestoring backups is now supported across
<strong>all installation methods!</strong> üéâ</p>
<p>Previously, only Home Assistant OS installations could restore backups. But
with this release, this feature is now available for all installation methods!
No matter how you run Home Assistant, even if you use our containers in a Docker
environment, you can now restore your Home Assistant backups.</p>
<p>This also means you can restore backups from local storage, Home Assistant
Cloud, or any future backup locations added through integrations.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, all backup features, including everything we release today,
will be available regardless of the installation method you are using. We want
everyone to have a solid backup strategy.</p>
<h3>Backup retention üóë</h3>
<p>Our previous backup system made solid backups, which was good, but if you didn‚Äôt
clean them up manually, eventually, you‚Äôd annoyingly run out of disk space. üò¨</p>
<p>So! Backup retention is now a thing! You can now configure how many backups you
want to keep, and Home Assistant will handle the rest.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="You can now configure a retention policy for your backups, allowing Home Assistant to clean it up automatically" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-retention.png" />
<p>This cleanup will happen automatically after each backup. If you create a backup
manually for whatever reason, those will remain untouched, giving you full
control over special cases and workflows.</p>
<h3>Setting up backups for the first time üöÄ</h3>
<p>Getting started with the new backup system is quick and easy!</p>
<p>The first time you open the backup settings after upgrading, you will be greeted
by a <strong>setup wizard</strong> that will guide you through setting up your backups
step-by-step.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the our friendly wizard that will help you setting up your backups" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-wizard.png" />
<p>The wizard will help you set up your encryption key, configure your backup
frequency, and set up your backup retention policy. And when it is ready, it
will immediately kick off your first backup!</p>
<p>All set! One less thing to worry about üéâ</p>
<h3>3‚Ä¶2‚Ä¶1‚Ä¶ Backups üéä</h3>
<p>We are super excited about this new backup system! As we enter the new year,
we encourage you to get serious about your backups.
A good New Year‚Äôs resolution, maybe? üòâ</p>
<p>So, stop what you are doing right now and set up your backups! Go ahead and set
up that 3-2-1 backup strategy. Not sure what that is?</p>
<p><strong>You can read all about it in our <a href="/blog/2025/01/03/3-2-1-backup/">3‚Ä¶2‚Ä¶1‚Ä¶ Backup blog post</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Month of ‚ÄúWhat the Heck?!‚Äù</h2>
<p>December‚Äôs <strong><a href="/blog/2024/11/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck/">Month of ‚ÄúWhat the Heck?!‚Äù</a></strong>
was an absolute blast! üéâ</p>
<p>A big thank you to everyone who contributed by sharing their ‚ÄúWhat the Heck?!‚Äù
moments and ideas for improving Home Assistant. Your input is incredibly
valuable and helps shape our roadmap and priorities moving forward.</p>
<p>Quite a bunch of shared ‚ÄúWhat the Heck?!‚Äù moments have been addressed in this
release already üöÄ ‚Äîand we‚Äôre not stopping there! Expect to see even more
improvements inspired by your feedback in upcoming releases.</p>
<h3>Setting categories and labels when creating automations and scripts</h3>
<p>For the first WTH item that has been resolved, we have <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a> to thank!
And this one is also one of the higher-voted ones, so it is a good one!
Andrew Jackson wrote:</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-can-you-not-add-categories-labels-etc-when-creating-an-automation/802562"><em><strong>‚ÄúWTH can you not add categories, labels etc when creating an automation‚Äù</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Yeah, that is a good WTH! Whenever you create a new automation or script, you
probably want to organize it right away and not have to go back to the settings.
<strong>FIXED</strong>! üéâ</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="If you press the d on your keyboard, it will pop up the Quickbar for devices" src="/images/blog/2025-01/wth-category-labels-new-automation.png" />
<p>When you create a new automation or script, and also when renaming it,
you can now set the description, category, labels, and areas right away!
üè∑Ô∏è Nice!</p>
<h3>Quickly navigate to a device</h3>
<p>You might be aware that you can bring up our quick navigation bar anywhere in
Home Assistant by pressing the¬†<code>c</code>¬†key on your keyboard to navigate various
places and the¬†<code>e</code>¬†key to search and navigate to any entity. However‚Ä¶</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-is-there-no-quick-bar-for-devices/802310"><em><strong>‚ÄúWTH is there no quick bar for devices?‚Äù</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Well, that is a good question that Andreas Brett raised! There is indeed no
such thing for devices. <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a> to the rescue! You can now navigate to any
device using the quick bar by pressing the <code>d</code> key on your keyboard.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="If you press the d on your keyboard, it will pop up the quick bar for devices" src="/images/blog/2025-01/wth-quickbar-devices.png"/>
<h3>Zoom &amp; Pan for charts</h3>
<p>KNXBroker raised the following WTH topic:</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-lets-upgrade-history-graphs/802568"><em><strong>‚ÄúWTH lets upgrade History Graphs‚Äù</strong></em></a></p>
<p>You are right! The history graphs in Home Assistant are basic but functional!
Nevertheless, we can do better! üöÄ</p>
<p>One of the bigger items in that WTH topic was the ability to zoom and pan‚Ä¶
Thanks to¬†<a href="https://github.com/MindFreeze">@MindFreeze</a>, you can now zoom and pan in any graph
in Home Assistant! üìà</p>
<p class="img">
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Zoom any graph in Home Assistant, by holding ctrl or command and scrolling your mouse wheel!" src="/images/blog/2025-01/wth-zoom-graphs.gif"/>
Zoom and drag any graph in Home Assistant, by holding ctrl (or command on mac)
and scrolling your mouse wheel!
</p>
<p>Hold the control key (or command on macOS) and scroll to zoom in and out using
your mouse. You can also click and drag to pan around the zoomed graph.</p>
<p>In addition to this change,¬†<a href="https://github.com/MindFreeze">@MindFreeze</a>¬†enabled small micro-animation for the
history graphs, making them look more alive and less static.</p>
<h3>Controlling the default exposure of new entities to Assist</h3>
<p>mathd made the following point in a Month of ‚ÄúWhat the Heck?!‚Äù topic:</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-are-all-new-entities-exposed-to-assist-by-default/803889"><em>‚ÄúWTH Are all new entities exposed to Assist by default?‚Äù</em></a></p>
<p>We hear you! Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a>, you can now control the default exposure of
new entities to Assist. You can now toggle this on or off in the Home Assistant
Voice Assistant settings.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Zoom any graph in Home Assistant, by holding ctrl or command and scroll your mouse wheel!" src="/images/blog/2025-01/wth-default-expose-to-assist.png" />
<h3>More ‚ÄúWhat the Heck?!‚Äù improvements</h3>
<p>Many smaller improvements originate from the Month of ‚ÄúWhat the Heck?!‚Äù in this
release. Here are some of the other noteworthy ones:</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-there-is-no-hotkey-for-assist/802403"><em><strong>‚ÄúWTH there is no hotkey for Assist‚Äù</strong></em></a>**</p>
<p>Well, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a>, you can now press the <code>a</code> key on your keyboard
anywhere in Home Assistant to summon Assist! üéôÔ∏è Nice!</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-doesnt-ha-ask-if-i-want-to-save-automations/804030"><em><strong>‚ÄúWTH doesn‚Äôt HA ask if I want to save automations?‚Äù</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Whoa! That is a good one! Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a>, Home Assistant will now ask if
you want to save your automation before leaving the editor if there are unsaved
changes. ü§ñ</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-is-in-energy-dashboard-the-individual-devices-not-able-to-reorder/805051"><em><strong>‚ÄúWTH Is in Energy Dashboard the individual devices not able to reorder‚Äù</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Thanks for that one yormedia! Honestly, this one has been raised in previous
editions of the Month of ‚ÄúWhat the Heck?!‚Äù a few times. Reason enough for
<a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a> to pick this up and make it happen! You can now reorder them in
the setting for categorization purposes. üî°</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-cant-i-filter-labels-within-a-table-filter/802529"><em><strong>‚ÄúWTH Can‚Äôt I filter labels within a table filter?‚Äù</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Good question. If you have a lot of labels, scrolling through the list of labels
in the filter option can be a bit cumbersome. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/silamon">@silamon</a>, you can
now search and filter through the labels in the filter option! üîé</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-sentence-trigger-doesnt-contain-any-context/802386"><em><strong>WTH sentence trigger doesn‚Äôt contain any context</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Great idea! Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a>, the full conversation input is now available
to sentence triggers! üó£Ô∏è This was actually the first WTH item to be resolved in
this edition! üòé</p>

<h3>Now available to set up from the UI</h3>
<p>While most <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.</p>
<p>The following integration is now available via the Home Assistant UI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/niko_home_control">Niko Home Control</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/VandeurenGlenn">@VandeurenGlenn</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Farewell to the following</h3>
<p>The following <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> are also no longer available as
of this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DTE Energy Bridge</strong> has been removed after being deprecated. The integration
was no longer functional.</li>
<li><strong>Simulated</strong> has been previously deprecated and is now removed.</li>
<li><strong>Stookalert</strong> has been removed. The upstream data is no longer updated.
The <a href="/integrations/stookwijzer">Stookwijzer</a> integration is a good alternative to get the same information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>When viewing data tables and using <code>ctrl+f</code> in your browser to search, the
search input will now be focused automatically. As native browser searches
will not work on data tables. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/marcinbauer85">@marcinbauer85</a> adjusted the ‚ÄúAdd card‚Äù dialog, to automatically focus on the
search field when you add a card, so you can start typing to search
right away! Nice touch!</li>
<li>Images uploaded through Home Assistant (for example, as background or as a
user profile picture) are now browsable in the media browser.
Thanks <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a>!</li>
<li>The unit of measurement is now shown next to the numeric slider in the
more-info dialog of number entities. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/abmantis">@abmantis</a>!</li>
<li>Home Assistant now supports <code>mWh</code> as a unit of measurement for energy sensors
and <code>mW</code> for electrical potential power sensors. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/agners">@agners</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wendevlin">@wendevlin</a> added settings and category overflow actions to the automation
and script editor (the three-dotted menu in the top right corner), making
it easier to access those straight from the editor. Nice!</li>
<li>The <a href="/dashboards/logbook/">logbook card</a> supports picking a target for things it should show
events for. You can now pick based on entities, devices, areas,  floors,
and labels! Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/silamon">@silamon</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dashboard background settings</h2>
<p>A few releases ago, we made adding a background image to your dashboard easier.
This release, <a href="https://github.com/silamon">@silamon</a> takes it a step further by adding a lot of settings
to customize how the background image is displayed.</p>
<p>This includes support for tiled backgrounds, transparency, size settings,
alignment, and allowing the background to scroll with the page or stay fixed.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="You can now fully customize the background of your dashboard, with the options to changing tiling, transparency, alignment, and size seettings" src="/images/blog/2025-01/dashboards-background-settings.png" />
<p>Nice! Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/silamon">@silamon</a>!</p>
<h2>Media player volume feature for Tile card</h2>
<p>This is a super nice addition from <a href="https://github.com/simon-zumbrunnen">@simon-zumbrunnen</a>! The Tile card now
supports a media player volume slider feature. This feature allows you to
control the volume of a media player directly from the Tile card. üîâ
Nice work Simon!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="The tile card with a media player entity, having the volume feature slider enabled" src="/images/blog/2025-01/tile-card-feature-volume-slider.png" />

<p><strong>TL;DR: <a href="/voice-pe/">Check out the product page</a></strong></p>
<p>We all deserve a voice assistant that doesn‚Äôt harvest our data and arbitrarily limit features. In the same way Home Assistant made private and local home automation a viable option, we believe the same can, and must be done for voice assistants.</p>
<p>Since we began developing our open-source voice assistant for Home Assistant, one key element has been missing - great hardware that‚Äôs simple to set up and use. Hardware that hears you, gives you clear feedback, and seamlessly fits into the home. Affordable and high-quality voice hardware will let more people join in on its development and allow anyone to <em>preview</em> the future of voice assistants today. Setting a standard for the next several years to base our development around.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/vpe-packaging.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Voice Preview Edition with packaging"></p>
<p>We‚Äôre launching <a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a> to help accelerate our goal of not only matching the capabilities of existing voice assistants but surpassing them. This is inevitable: They‚Äôll focus their efforts on monetizing voice, while our community will be focused on improving open and private voice. We‚Äôll support the languages big tech ignores and provide a real choice in how you run voice in your home.</p>
<p><strong>The era of open, private voice assistants begins now, and we‚Äôd love for you to be part of it.</strong></p>

<h2>Introducing Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</h2>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/voice-preview-edition.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Voice Preview Edition with packaging">
<p>Our main goal with Voice Preview Edition was to make the best hardware to get started with <a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a>, Home Assistant‚Äôs built-in voice assistant. If you‚Äôre already using other third-party hardware to run Assist, this will be a big upgrade. We prioritized its ability to hear commands, giving it an industry-leading dedicated audio processor and dual microphones - I‚Äôm always blown away by how well it picks up my voice around the room.</p>
<p>Next, we ensured it would blend into the home, giving it a sleek but unobtrusive design. That‚Äôs not to say it doesn‚Äôt have flair. When you get your hands on Voice Preview Edition the first thing you‚Äôll notice is its premium-feeling injection-molded shell, which is semi-transparent, just like your favorite ‚Äò90s tech. The LED ring is also really eye-catching, and you can customize it to your heart‚Äôs content from full gamer RGB to subtle glow.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
<img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/vpe-finish.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="3 different views of Voice Preview Edition">
</div>
<p>It‚Äôs hard to convey how nice the rotary dial is to use; its subtle clicks paired with LED animations are hard not to play with. Most importantly, the dial lets anyone in your home intuitively adjust the volume. The same can be said for the multipurpose button and mute switch (which physically cuts power to the microphone for ultimate privacy). We knew for it to work best, it needed to be out in the open, and let‚Äôs just say that <a href="https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/open-home-approval-factor/#:~:text=2023.1%20release%20notes.-,Home%20Approval%20Factor,-We%20have%20a">Home Approval Factor</a> was very front of mind when designing it.</p>
<p>We also worked hard to keep the price affordable and comparable to other voice assistant hardware at just $59 (that‚Äôs the recommended MSRP, and pricing will vary by retailer). This isn‚Äôt a preorder, it‚Äôs available now!</p>

<h3>Why Preview Edition</h3>
<p>For some, our voice assistant is all they need; they just want to say a couple of commands, set timers, manage their shopping list, and control their most used devices. For others, we understand they want to ask their voice assistant to make whale sounds or to tell them how tall Taylor Swift is - this voice assistant doesn‚Äôt entirely do those things (<a href="/voice_control/assist_create_open_ai_personality/">yet</a>). We think there is still more we can do before this is ready for every home, and until then, we‚Äôll be selling this <em>Preview</em> of the future of voice assistants. We‚Äôve built the best hardware on the market, and set a new standard for the coming years, allowing us to focus our development as we prepare our voice assistant for every home. Taking back our privacy isn‚Äôt for everyone - it‚Äôs a journey - and we want as many people as possible to join us early and make it better.</p>
<h3>Built for Home Assistant</h3>
<p>Many other voice assistants work with Home Assistant, but this one was <em>built</em> for Home Assistant. Unlike other voice hardware that can work with Assist, this doesn‚Äôt require flashing firmware or any assembly. You plug it into power, and it is seamlessly discovered by Home Assistant. A wizard instantly starts helping you set up your voice assistant, but critically, if you haven‚Äôt used voice before, it will quickly guide you through what you need to get the best experience.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/wizard.webp' alt="Video of Assist wizard">Get up and running with Voice Preview Edition in minutes with our new wizard</a>
<p>This is not a DIY product. We‚Äôve worked to make the experience as smooth as possible, with easy and fast updates and settings you can manage from the Home Assistant UI.</p>
<h3>Advanced audio processing</h3>
<p>If you have been following our work on voice, you know we‚Äôve tried a lot of different voice assistant hardware. Most available Assist-capable hardware is bad at its most important job - hearing your voice and then providing audiovisual feedback. That was really what drove us to build Voice Preview Edition.</p>
<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid="DS_8cDZKBPc" videotitle="Music Assistant - VPE"></lite-youtube>Voice Preview Editions mics and audio processors effortlessly hear commands through loud music it is playing</p>
<p>Our Assist software could only do so much with substandard audio, and its functionality is massively improved with clear audio. The dual microphones combined with the XMOS audio processing chip are what makes it so capable. Together, they allow Voice Preview Edition to have echo cancellation, stationary noise removal, and auto gain control, which all adds up to clearer audio. This combined with an ESP32-S3 with 8 MB of octal PSRAM - one of the fastest ESP and RAM combinations available - makes for an incredibly responsive device. This is the best Assist hardware you can buy today, and it will continue to give a great experience as Assist‚Äôs feature set expands in the years to come.</p>
<h3>Bringing choice to voice</h3>
<p>Assist can do something almost no other voice assistant can achieve - <em>it can run without the internet</em> ü§Ø. You can speak to your Voice Preview Edition, and those commands can be processed completely within the walls of your home. At the time of writing this, there are some pretty big caveats, specifically that you need to speak a <a href="/voice-pe/#language-support">supported language</a> and have pretty powerful hardware to run it (we recommend a Home Assistant system running on an Intel N100 or better).</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/local-cloud.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="graphic of local vs cloud">Diagram of cloud vs local speech processing</p>
<p>If you use low-powered Home Assistant hardware, there is an easy and affordable internet-based solution; <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a>. This privacy-focused service allows you to offload your speech-to-text and text-to-speech processing, all while being very responsive and keeping your energy bill low. Speech-to-text is the harder of the two to run locally, and our cloud processing is almost always more accurate for more languages (visit our <a href="/voice-pe/#language-support">language support checker here</a>).</p>
<p>Our goal is for Assist to run easily, affordably, and fully locally for all languages. As someone who has seen the rapid development of this technology over the past several years, I‚Äôm optimistic that this will happen, but until then, many languages have a good range of choices that provide strong privacy.</p>
<h3>Fully open and customizable</h3>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/3d-prints.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Some interesting cartoon-inspired 3D prints for Voice Preview Edition">We are sharing the design files if you want to 3D print a new case... these ones were inevitable</p>
<p>We‚Äôre not just launching a new product, <em><strong>we‚Äôre open sourcing all of it</strong></em>. We built this for the Home Assistant community. Our community doesn‚Äôt want a single voice assistant, they want the one that works for them ‚Äì they want choice. Creating a voice assistant is hard, and until now, parts of the solution were locked behind expensive licenses and proprietary software. With Voice Preview Edition being open source, we hope to bootstrap an ecosystem of voice assistants.</p>
<p>We tried to make every aspect of Voice Preview Edition customizable, which is actually pretty easy when you‚Äôre working hand-in-hand with ESPHome and Home Assistant. It works great with the stock settings, but if you‚Äôre so inclined, you can customize the Assist software, ESP32 firmware, and XMOS firmware.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/grove.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Voice Preview Edition with packaging">Connecting Grove sensors allows you to use your Voice Preview Edition as a more traditional ESPHome device - here is it acting as a voice assistant and air monitor.</p>
<p>We also made the hardware easy to modify, inside and out. For instance, the included speaker is for alerts and voice prompts, but if you want to use it as a media player, connect a speaker to the included 3.5mm headphone jack and control it with software like <a href="https://music-assistant.io/">Music Assistant</a>. The included DAC is very clean and capable of streaming lossless audio. It can also be used as a very capable ESP32 device. On the bottom of the device is a <a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System/">Grove port</a> (concealed under a cover that can be permanently removed), which allows you to connect a large ecosystem of sensors and accessories.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also made it quite painless to open, with easy-to-access screws and no clips. We even included exposed pads on the circuit board to make modifying it more straightforward. We‚Äôre providing all the <a href="https://voice-pe.home-assistant.io/resources/">3D files</a> so you can print your own components‚Ä¶ even cartoon character-inspired ones. We‚Äôre not here to dictate what you can and can‚Äôt do with your device, and we tried our best to stay out of your way.</p>
<h3>Community-driven</h3>
<p>The beauty of Home Assistant and ESPHome is that you are never alone when fixing an issue or adding a feature. We made this device so the community could start working more closely together on voice; we even considered calling it the <em>Community</em> edition. Ultimately, it is the community driving forward voice - either by taking part in its development or supporting its development by buying official hardware or Home Assistant Cloud. So much has already been done for voice, and I can‚Äôt wait to see the advancements we make together.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Home Assistant <del>values</del> champions choice. Today, we‚Äôre providing one of the best choices for voice hardware. One that is truly private and totally open. I‚Äôm so proud of the team for building such a great working and feeling piece of hardware - this is a really big leap for voice hardware. I expect it to be the hardware benchmark for open-voice projects for years to come. I would also like to thank our language leaders who are expanding the reach of this project, our testers of this Preview Edition, and anyone who has joined in our voice work over the past years.</p>
<p>The hardware really is only half the picture, and it‚Äôs the software that really brings this all together. Mike Hansen has just written the <a href="/blog/2024/12/19/voice-chapter-8-assist-in-the-home/">Voice Chapter 8 blog</a> to accompany this launch, and this explains all the things we‚Äôve built over the past two years to make Assist work in the home today. He also highlights everything that Voice Preview Edition was built to help accelerate development.</p>
