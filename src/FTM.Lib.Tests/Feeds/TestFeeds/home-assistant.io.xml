<p>Matter in Home Assistant has been officially certified! 🎉 The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) has certified <a href="https://csa-iot.org/csa_product/home-assistant/">Home Assistant</a> and the <a href="https://csa-iot.org/csa_product/open-home-foundation-matter-server/">Open Home Foundation Matter Server</a>, the first open-source project to receive this certification. Certification is proof that open source projects can sit among, or even above, big tech when it comes to providing the best smart home experience.</p>
<p>Home Assistant, as part of the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, strongly believes in open standards. They embody our values of choice, privacy, and sustainability in the smart home. When a standard is well supported, consumers get access to a wide range of smart home devices that should work far into the future, which is great for sustainability. Best of all, they work locally, keeping your smart home data in your home.</p>
<p>All these benefits led us to include open standards certification <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#open-standards-certified-quality">in our roadmap</a>. Home Assistant’s implementations of Matter, Zigbee, and Z-Wave are already industry-leading, so it only makes sense to clearly signal and give users peace of mind that we provide true compatibility. This most recent certification is not just big for Home Assistant, but read on to see how it also helps any open source project looking to use Matter.</p>

<h2>Matter matters</h2>
<p class="img"><lite-youtube videoid="rEugjMk-4II" videotitle="State of Matter 2024"></lite-youtube>Our live stream from 2024 explains Matter in depth</p>
<p>Matter is the latest smart home open standard, which is looking to connect and control smart home devices regardless of their manufacturer or which ecosystem you want to control them from. Like the other open standards we support, it can be controlled fully locally, meaning these devices are not reliant on the cloud to work. The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) is the body behind the Matter standard, representing its many members. They certify devices and set the rules on how they work together.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Matter, I’m not surprised. Though its adoption is growing, it’s only a <a href="https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-arrives/">couple of years old</a>. The most important companies in the smart home space have joined this standard, but support is still growing and becoming more consistent. If it fulfills its promise, any smart home product should work with your ecosystem of choice, and that makes us optimistic about its future.</p>
<p>More and more Matter devices are entering the market, and if you’re buying new smart devices, it will just be a matter of time 😉 before you own one. To this point, Matter devices are even a part of our <a href="https://partner.home-assistant.io/">Works With Home Assistant</a> program. <a href="/blog/2024/09/03/aqara-joins-works-with-home-assistant/">Aqara was the first</a> to join our program with Matter devices, and we tested these devices ourselves to ensure they give the best experience possible in Home Assistant. This year, we expect many more Matter devices to join the program, and we should have more updates soon.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, Matter is really interesting—it can work with different smart home systems at the same time. It also keeps the way devices connect and communicate separate, allowing it to connect to devices over Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and <a href="/integrations/thread/">Thread</a> (a new mesh network technology for smart devices). Read our <a href="/blog/2024/01/25/matter-livestream-blog/">State of Matter blog</a> or watch Paulus’ appearance on <a href="https://youtu.be/0Y75XEXAXfY?si=nSDpP6THkWhkARuc&amp;t=3493">the Vergecast Matter Holiday Spec-Tacular</a> for a deeper dive into the standard.</p>
<h2>What certification brings</h2>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-matter-certification/ha-matter.png' alt="Home Assistant Matter certification"/>Well, this is a bit... awesome</p>
<p>First and foremost, from a usability perspective, nothing will change for you. We are consistently the first to adopt the newest Matter versions, currently providing the highest version available. We’ll keep on improving the Matter Server and the Matter integration at the same pace, ensuring that all device types in the Matter spec will work perfectly with Home Assistant—just from now on it will come with this certification badge.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://csa-iot.org/csa_product/open-home-foundation-matter-server/">Open Home Foundation Matter Server</a> is now an officially trusted/certified software component, while <a href="https://csa-iot.org/csa_product/home-assistant/">Home Assistant</a> is a certified “User Interface Component” (more on this distinction below). This allows us to clearly show this with a logo, along with being listed on the Matter website. For new Home Assistant users, this helps build confidence, knowing it is a supported way to use Matter. Similarly, for brands that don’t know much about Home Assistant, these references can be surprisingly helpful, and it’s our goal to have more brands target Home Assistant in their development. Another handy part of being certified is getting more access to pre-test new devices and SDK revisions, which will help development going forward.</p>
<h3>Why two certifications (and the server add-on)</h3>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-matter-certification/ohf-matter.png' alt="Open Home Foundation Matter Server is certified"/>So much fun we did it twice</p>
<p>If you’re confused why we certified both Home Assistant and Open Home Foundation Matter Server, there are a couple of legal/procedural reasons, but it comes with some useful benefits. We certified the server as a standalone component to allow any project to use it. Each project that uses it, including Home Assistant, will have to go through a certification process to acknowledge that it uses a certified component as a “User Interface Component”. Certification for the Open Home Foundation Matter Server means it properly connects and communicates with other Matter devices, while certification for Home Assistant is about being able to display the Matter trademark.</p>
<p>This separation is important because it means that we won’t need to go through recertification every time we update Home Assistant. This way we can keep the Matter-related backend isolated in both a software and certification sense. This is also why we will need to continue to have the Open Home Foundation Matter Server as an add-on, and it cannot be built into <a href="/installation/#advanced-installation-methods">Home Assistant Core</a>.</p>
<h2>The road to certification</h2>
<p>Becoming Matter certified was not easy. When we started certification, the process was tooled up to test and certify devices, not Matter controllers, let alone completely software-based (and open source) controllers. We chose to collaborate with <a href="https://www.resillion.com/services/conformance-interoperability/wireless-product-testing/matter-certification/">Resillion</a> for our certification. They are a testing and certification house based in Belgium with a lot of experience certifying Matter products. They do the formal testing and submit the results to the CSA. Together, we collaborated to write thousands of lines of test scripts, ensuring that as many test cases as possible were automated.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-matter-certification/lab.jpg' alt="Marcel van der Veldt at the Resillion lab"/>My visit to Resillion's lab, I brought my own lab coat</p>
<p>We really appreciate Resillion for taking on this challenge. Not only were we the first controller they certified, but we also went for all the device types in the Matter 1.3 specification. This was a huge effort for all involved, but now that these test scripts exist, they only require minor updates for each new version; we can reuse them whenever we need to recertify.</p>
<div class="alert">
    <p>“At Resillion, we strongly support interoperability in connected home technology, and assure, secure and innovate to help make this technology work for everyone. For us, this was not only a fantastic way to contribute to the Home Assistant open-source project, but also upgrade our own Home Assistant instances with Matter, as enthusiasts of the project running active instances of HA in our own homes.</p>
    <p>“Working on a controller utilizing the full Matter 1.3 feature set presents a great opportunity to advance HA and Matter, and we look forward to supporting the developed codebase and further contributing to an open smart home.”</p>
    <em style="text-align: right; display: block;">- Jan Claes, Head of testing services - C&I Global, Resillion</em>
</div>
<p>This is another example of something that’s only possible because of the support we get from users subscribing to <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a>. Certification would be very difficult for any other open-source project, but we have the funding first to build a great server and also to pay for the required testing. Now this open source implementation exists and can be used by any project looking to add Matter.</p>
<h2>The future Matters</h2>
<p>As we continue improving our Matter implementation, the Matter standard itself is also evolving. Even with the progress it has made in the past year, there are still challenges to overcome. Matter is completely built on IPv6, and its rollout is uncovering the poor state of IPv6 support in today’s network hardware. Also, as it’s a complicated standard, it can be difficult to explain concepts like Thread and Fabrics to the average user, but hopefully users won’t need to be experts in the future to get the most out of Matter in their homes.</p>
<p>Some might call Matter the smart home standard to replace all others, but we believe that there’s room for multiple standards, each providing its own unique benefits. We are focused on providing the highest support for all local smart home standards (<a href="/blog/2024/11/15/roadmap-2024h2/#open-protocols">certifying other standards is on our roadmap</a>) and ensuring they work far into the future, which is great for consumer choice and sustainability.</p>
<p>As Home Assistant grows and takes important steps like certification, the more credibility we gain in the industry—it’s a virtuous circle that helps us and Open Home projects continuously improve. Thanks for your support and helping us make this possible 🙏.</p>

<h2>Dashboard view headers</h2>
<p>This release brings a whole new look with the ability to add headers to your
dashboards. This allows you to add a title and welcoming text to your dashboards
using Markdown and even templates. Additionally, this gives you a lot of space
for badges next to the header.</p>
<p>As always, we’ve baked in a lot of customization, with the ability to align the
header in multiple different ways. It comes with a responsive layout by default,
but you can also set it to always be left-aligned or center-aligned.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2025-03/dashboard-view-header.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new header feature in the dashboard view." />
<p>The badges can also be positioned below the text (default) or above the text. A
great visual menu makes it easy to choose how you want to organize your header.</p>
<h2>Tile cards</h2>
<p>This release has made many improvements and fine touches to the tile card. It
is one of the most versatile cards in Home Assistant,
and we have made it even better!</p>
<h3>Making tile card interactions clearer</h3>
<p>There is no doubt the tile card can do a lot, but ever since its creation,
it has had a little flaw that you might have run into yourself…</p>
<p>How would you know if tapping the icon on the tile card would trigger
an action or whether it would just display more information? We have addressed
this with some subtle visual language in this release!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2025-03/tile-card-clear-interactions.png" alt="Screenshot showing tile cards with and without direct actions on their icons. The ones that do have a direct action have a circular background, others don't." />
<p>When tapping the icon on the tile card directly performs an action,
like for example, turning on a light, the icon will have a circular background
around it. In all other cases, the little circle will not be displayed.</p>
<p>Now you know! 👍</p>
<h3>Position tile card features</h3>
<p>Since <a href="/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/#resize-the-cards-on-your-dashboard">we added support for resizing cards</a>,
we gained the ability to make very wide tile cards. These cards have a lot of
empty space surrounding them, which can be helpful at times.</p>
<p>But what if you could do something useful with that space? Now you can!
All features of a tile card can now be positioned inline in the tile card!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2025-03/tile-card-inline-features.png" alt="Screenshot showcasing the new inline tile card features (versus the existing bottom feature" />
<p>This brings a completely new look and feel, which we are sure you will love!
From the settings, you can add a feature, like a brightness slider, and position
it either below (bottom) or to the right side of the icon (inline).</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <p class="alert-title"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>
  <p class="alert-content">
<p>Only the first feature can be positioned inline; the rest will not be displayed.</p>
  </p>
</div>
<h3>New tile card features</h3>
<p>This release also ships with two new tile card features that can be
added to your entities to provide new controls. <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a> contributed these,
so a big shout out to him!</p>
<h4>Switch toggle</h4>
<p>The first addition is one that is just surprising we didn’t have it before:
A switch toggle! This allows you to toggle a switch entity directly from the
tile card.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2025-03/tile-card-switch-toggle.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new tile card feature for switch entities." />
<h4>Counter actions</h4>
<p>The second addition is a counter toggle. This allows you to add a button to
increase, decrease, or reset a counter entity directly from the tile card.</p>
<img class=" no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2025-03/tile-card-counter-actions.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new tile card feature for counter helper entities."/>
<h3>Tiny interaction improvements</h3>
<p>More tweaks to the tile card have been made to improve their interaction
experience. For example, we now have nice little animations when you hover over
the tile card, making it more apparent that it is interactive. Still, when you
tap the tile card, it will show a little animation to indicate that the
tap was registered.</p>
<center>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2025-03/tile-card-interactions.gif" alt="Screenrecording showing the new tiny micro interactions added to the tile card and a small demo of using keyboard navigation" />
</center>
<p>Another nice addition is that the tile card can now interact with your keyboard!
Tab and shift + tab your way across the screen like the keyboard warrior you are.</p>
<h3>Editor improvements</h3>
<p>Not just the tile card itself has been improved, but also the editor for
the tile card has been improved. It is now clearer and easier to use.</p>
<p>The new control gives you a better overview of what the option will do for
the tile card.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2025-03/card-editor-improvements.png" alt="Screenshot showing the brand new visual card editor that make it more visually clear what options do." />
<h2>Assist chat now has streaming responses</h2>
<p>If you have hooked up an LLM, like ChatGPT, to your Assist as
a conversation agent, it will now livestream the responses to you when
you are text chatting with it!</p>
<p>When experimenting with larger models, or on slower hardware, LLM’s can feel
sluggish. They only respond once the entire reply is generated, which can take
frustratingly long for lengthy responses (you’ll be waiting a while if you ask
it to tell you an epic fairy tale).</p>
<p>We’ve added support for LLMs to stream their response to the text chat, allowing you
to start reading while the response is being generated. A bonus side effect is
that commands are now also faster: they will be executed as soon as they come
in, without waiting for the rest of the message to be complete.</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="k6VvzDSI8RU" videoStartAt="3239" videotitle="Voice - Chapter 9"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>There was quite a lot more to tell around Assist and the new voice features;
in case you missed it, you can read all about it in this blog post:</p>
<p>📰 <a href="/blog/2025/02/13/voice-chapter-9-speech-to-phrase/">Speech-to-Phrase brings voice home - Voice chapter 9</a></p>

SmartThings shut down the old authentication method, but thanks to
SmartThings’ hard work and close collaboration with us, <a href="https://github.com/joostlek">@joostlek</a> was able to
bring back the integration—better than ever.</p>
<p>No more setting up routing, exposing ports, or creating developer accounts with
access tokens—<strong>just log in with your Samsung account</strong>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>And there’s more! Push updates now work without exposing your instance to the
internet, making the experience faster, seamless, and more secure! 🚀</p>
<p>A huge shoutout to our amazing community, who played a key role in this effort!
💙 When <a href="https://github.com/joostlek">@joostlek</a> shared a guide on gathering test data, the community
stepped up—sending in valuable test data that helped fine-tune the integration.
This collaboration truly made a difference!</p>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ever upgraded Home Assistant and needed to do a hard refresh in your
browser to make it work again? We have been able to reduce the cases in
which this happens! Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/bramkragten">@bramkragten</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a> made a small change with a big impact. When you set up a new
integration for a new device, Home Assistant will now redirect you to the
device page after setting it up. Nice!</li>
<li>There is now an option to add an extra margin to the top of a section view.
Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/piitaya">@piitaya</a>!</li>
<li>The add/edit area dialog has been improved and compacted. They are
much more pleasant to use now. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a>!</li>
<li>We now have a device class for the wind direction sensors! Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/edenhaus">@edenhaus</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jschlyter">@jschlyter</a> has added the energy distance device class for sensors,
which supports the following units: <code>kWh/100mi</code>, <code>kWh/100km</code>, and <code>mi/kWh</code>,
including conversion between them. Awesome!</li>
<li>Media player entities that support browsing media now have a new action
available to <a href="/integrations/media_player#action-media_playerbrowse_media">browse media as an action with a response</a>. Thanks, <a href="https:/github.com/PeteRager">@PeteRager</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rikroe">@rikroe</a> has added an action to <a href="/integrations/schedule#action-scheduleget_schedule">retrieve the configuration of a schedule
helper</a>. Thanks!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Iterating on the legends of graphs</h2>
<p>Last release, we made <a href="/blog/2025/02/05/release-20252/#preparing-our-graphs-for-the-future">quite a big change to the charts</a>
by replacing the software we use to make these graphs in Home Assistant. Things
changed behind the scenes, but our aim to start was to make it look
and feel similar.</p>
<p>However, we received a lot of feedback from the community that the legends shown
on the new graphs were suboptimal. Our UX and frontend teams have been working
hard to improve this situation and make the new graph legends more similar
to the old ones.</p>
<center>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="A screen recording showing expanding and collapsing the legend" src="/images/blog/2025-03/graph-legend.gif"/>
</center>
<p>By default, we show the legend below the graph and show as many data points
as possible. If there are too many, they will be displayed on demand using the
little ellipsis button.</p>
<p>When using these cards on your dashboard, if you want to always show the full
legend, a new option will allow you to keep it fully visible.</p>
<p>You can now also zoom in and out, by double clicking on a graph. If you want
more control over the range you want to view in your graph, you can press the
ctrl/cmd key and then select the range on the graph you want to zoom in on.</p>
<h2>Grouping/clustering of trackables on the maps</h2>
<p>The map card is perfect for visualizing your entities’ locations, but when too
many cluster together in the same spot, it can get a bit cluttered.</p>
<p>To tackle this, we’ve introduced marker clustering, which groups nearby entities
together, making it easier to see them at a glance. When zooming in, the markers
‘spider’ out, showing individual entity locations with a connecting line to
their original positions. You can temporarily disable clustering with a
simple toggle.</p>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a> and <a href="https://github.com/marcinbauer85">@marcinbauer85</a> for this awesome improvement!</p>

<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.3 in March.
These patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch
release every Friday.</p>

a <code>variables</code> action is present in the inner scope.</p>
<p>Furthermore, variables defined by a <code>response_variable</code> now also propagate

<p>Over the past several months, <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/">Music Assistant</a> has been hitting all the right notes with new features, greater stability, and a crescendo of contributors who keep pushing the project forward. If you’re <a href="/blog/2024/05/09/music-assistant-2/#what-is-music-assistant">unfamiliar with Music Assistant</a>, it allows you to merge your libraries from leading audio streaming providers and local files, letting you play them on the most popular smart speakers. Since our <a href="/blog/2024/05/09/music-assistant-2/">last update</a>, Music Assistant has had a couple of big releases, but our most recent might just be our platinum record 💿, with a lot of new functionality coming in version 2.4. In case you’ve missed the last few updates, here are the biggest additions.</p>

<h3>“Say My Name”</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">Optimized for Assist</h4>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/voice_ma.jpg' alt="audiobooks page"/>We should have called it Hi-Fi edition</p>
<p>The most recent release has some great advancements for <a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a> devices, like the <a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a>. We’ve been working closely with the <a href="https://esphome.io/">ESPHome</a> team to ensure the most optimal audio streaming experience, which has helped make Assist devices into very capable media players. The community has even added some great functionality to fully <a href="https://github.com/music-assistant/voice-support">control your media player with your voice</a>, including choosing songs, artists, and more. Voice Preview Edition has a high-quality DAC that provides very clean audio playback from its 3.5mm jack, allowing you to stream lossless audio to connected speakers (this $59 device puts some of my expensive Hi-Fi gear to shame!).</p>
<h3>“Across the Universe”</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">External audio & Spotify Connect</h4>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/spotify_connect.jpg' alt="Spotify Connect on a Voice PE"/>Spotify Connect on Voice Preview Edition</p>
<p>Another feature in the latest release is support for “external audio sources”, which can be provided either by players themselves (source control) or with plugins. The first plugin to deliver this functionality is Spotify Connect. It’s the easiest way to use Spotify with Music Assistant, and can be enabled on any player. This makes any Music Assistant supported device a Spotify Connect supported device (can confirm, Voice Preview Edition is great for this). <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/plugins/spotify-connect/">To get started</a> go to Music Assistant’s settings, add the Spotify Connect Plugin, choose the devices you would like it to use, and within Spotify you will see the device as a player. Just note, Spotify Connect requires a Premium account to work.</p>
<p>We’ve got our sights set on adding even more plugins like this down the line (AirPlay, anyone?). We’re also hard at work making the whole setup process super simple, particularly for those using the Voice Preview Edition who might not need every single Music Assistant feature, but still want this simple casting capability.</p>
<h3>“Radio Ga Ga”</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">Podcasts & Audiobooks</h4>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/audiobooks.png' alt="audiobooks page"/>The full book's progress is tracked, and chapters are clearly shown</p>
<p>Your library just got a whole lot bigger! Music Assistant now has native support for podcasts and audiobooks. For podcasts, several providers have been added, including <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/subsonic/">Subsonic</a>, <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/youtube-music/">YouTube</a>, and <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/podcastfeed/">RSS feeds</a>. Audiobooks can be added via two brand new providers: <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/audible/">Audible</a> and <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/audiobookshelf/">Audiobookshelf</a>, or imported directly from your local files. Audiobook playback presents the entire book as a single bar with dots showing each chapter (even if the book is separated into multiple files), allowing you to really track your progress. The entire core has been adjusted to keep better track of your progress through any media, so you will always resume where you left off.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/continue.png' alt="Continue listening section"/>The "Continue listening" section on the home page takes you back to where you left off</p>
<h3>“New Sensation”</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">More players and providers</h4>
<p>Shortly after our last blog post, we added support for <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> which was one of the most requested additions in the comments. A couple of other new providers were added, including <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/ibroadcast/">iBroadcast</a> and <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/siriusxm/">SiriusXM</a>. For new hardware support we’ve added support for <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/player-support/bluesound/">Bluesound</a> players. If you have a provider or player you love and want to see it in Music Assistant, <a href="https://github.com/orgs/music-assistant/discussions?discussions_q=sort%3Atop">request it</a>—but better yet <a href="https://github.com/music-assistant/server">join us in developing it</a>!</p>
<h3>“All About That Bass”</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">Equalizer control & features</h4>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/eq.png' alt="PEQ page"/>Make your own EQ settings or import pre-made settings for your speaker</p>
<p>When we released 2.0 there were basic bass and treble controls for devices, but with our new <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/audiopipeline/">configurable DSP</a> (Digital Signal Processor) you can now fine-tune your audio like never before. This includes input and output gain, along with a powerful <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/dsp/parametriceq/">parametric equalizer</a> that can be applied per player 📈. You can conveniently view the entire audio pipeline by clicking the quality indicator icon.</p>
<p><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/audio_path.png' alt="Music Assistants next big hit" class='no-shadow' /></p>
<p>Another useful feature added was a “<a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/usage/#:~:text=Don%27t%20Stop%20The%20Music%20(DSTM)">Don’t stop the music</a>” mode that keeps music playing even once your queue finishes, playing similar songs from your library. Another way to keep the music playing is through lock screens and widget controls built into many popular operating systems, which can now control Music Assistant.</p>
<h3>“Master of Puppets”</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">Home Assistant improvements</h4>
<p>Home Assistant was always designed to work seamlessly with Music Assistant, and it’s only getting better. In the <a href="/blog/2024/12/04/release-202412/#new-integrations">Home Assistant 2024.12 release</a>, we gave the community a Christmas present–Music Assistant moved from HACS to being a native integration (<a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/integration/migrate/">please migrate if you haven’t yet</a>).</p>
<p>Many people now add all their players to Music Assistant first and then integrate Music Assistant with Home Assistant, eliminating the need to add each device separately. The most recent release added the ability to outsource any player control, including volume or turning it on/off, to a Home Assistant entity. There are other benefits to using them together, like Music Assistant <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/integration/announcements/">resuming audio playback</a> after an announcement or using Assist to find and play a song (<a href="https://github.com/music-assistant/voice-support">with or without LLMs</a>).</p>
<h3>“D-D-Don’t Don’t Stop the Beat”</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">More stable streaming</h4>
<p>One of the biggest goals for every release is to improve streaming stability across all providers and players. With every release, we’ve been improving stability, and since our last post, we’ve had a big influx of users who have been finding and helping squash bugs. There have been nice improvements to almost every provider helping with stability, speed, and quality. Just in the next patch release 2.4.3, we’ve improved streaming performance on slower network connections. The goal is that the music never stops.</p>
<h2>“Praise You” - 🙏</h2>
<p>A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to this release—whether through code, testing, or feedback. Your support keeps Music Assistant evolving into the ultimate tool for managing your music, on your players.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Apollo Automation is a growing family-run business rooted in the Home Assistant and ESPHome communities. And yes, they’re named after their German Shepherd, Apollo 🐕.</p>
<div class="alert">
    <p>Apollo Automation is built by and for the Home Assistant community. We believe in open smart home technology that gives users control, privacy, and flexibility. Joining the Works With Home Assistant program is a natural step for us, ensuring our devices integrate seamlessly while supporting the ecosystem we love. Home Assistant allows users to create powerful smart homes, and we are excited to contribute by making high-quality, reliable hardware that enhances the experience for everyone.</p>
    <em style="text-align: right; display: block;">- Justin Bunton, Co-Founder, Apollo Automation</em>
</div>
<p>Two years ago, they started sharing their designs for a new impressively small ESPHome-powered multisensor with the community. Getting feedback, sharing iterations, and working collaboratively, they turned that sensor into a full-fledged product, which was built to work with Home Assistant. They have continued this open, community-first approach and have now built several even more refined multisensors.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-02-apollo/multisensor.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Apollo MSR-2 multisensor">
A multisensor for ants? 🐜</p>
<p>Home Assistant is the <a href="https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/true-platforms-let-you-create/">only true smart home platform</a> because it gives everyone full control to build and create. <a href="/integrations/esphome/">ESPHome</a> is the ultimate smart device platform, and it is fostering an entirely new ecosystem of Open Home projects. ESPHome works fully locally, and it’s a modder’s paradise, allowing users to build DIY smart home devices (check out the <a href="https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html">getting started with ESPHome guide</a>).</p>
<p>Creators can also use it to build pre-built, plug-and-play products that give users a really seamless experience. With devices being discovered and easily added to your Wi-Fi network and Home Assistant, along with a one-click update within Home Assistant.</p>
<p>ESPHome and Home Assistant allows anyone to turn their passion for building cool things into a career, and the things they build help support a more vibrant Open Home. Apollo is an exciting new partner for the Works with Home Assistant program and should serve as an inspiration to all aspiring makers in our community.</p>
<h2>Devices</h2>
<p>Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates, while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, and it is the support of <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers that funds this work.</p>
<p>Apollo has chosen first to certify three products, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://apolloautomation.com/products/mtr-1">MTR-1 Multi-Target Radar Multisensor For Home Assistant (LD2450)</a> - A tiny, but powerful radar-based (mmWave) presence sensor that can pack in many other sensors.</li>
<li><a href="https://apolloautomation.com/products/msr-2">MSR-2 mmWave Multisensor For Home Assistant (LD2410B)</a> - An even smaller multisensor that is the successor of the initial community feedback-driven design.</li>
<li><a href="https://apolloautomation.com/products/air-1">AIR-1 Air Quality Sensor For Home Assistant</a> - A small air quality multisensor that can be extended to incorporate a huge variety of sensors.</li>
</ul>
<p>We anticipate that Apollo will bring more of their lineup into the program, and we are excited to see their new innovations going forward! This is just the start of a year of many new Works with Home Assistant announcements, so please stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong>Welcome to Voice chapter 9 🎉 part of our <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/categories/assist/">long-running series</a> following the development of open voice.</strong></p>
<p>We’re still pumped from the launch of the <a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a> at the end of December. It sold out 23 minutes into our announcement - wow! We’ve been working hard to keep it in stock at <a href="/voice-pe#buy">all our distributors</a>.</p>
<p>Today, we have a lot of cool stuff to improve your experience with Voice PE or any other Assist satellite you’re using. This includes fully local and offline voice control that can be powered by nearly any Home Assistant system.</p>

<p>Dragon NaturallySpeaking was a popular speech recognition program introduced in 1997. To run this software you needed at least a 133 MHz Pentium processor, 32 MB of RAM, and Windows 95 or later. Nearly thirty years later, Speech-to-Text is much better, but needs orders of magnitude more resources.</p>
<p>Incredible technologies are being developed in speech processing, but it’s currently unrealistic for a device that costs less than $100 to take real advantage of them. It’s possible, of course, but running the previously recommended Speech-to-Text tool, <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">Whisper</a>, on a Raspberry Pi 4 takes at least 5 seconds to turn your speech into text, with varying levels of success. This is why we ended up recommending at least an Intel N100 to run your voice assistant fully locally. That stung. Our opt-in analytics shows over <a href="https://analytics.home-assistant.io/">50% of the Home Assistant OS users</a> are running their homes on affordable, low-powered machines like the <a href="/green">Home Assistant Green</a> or a Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>What’s more, advancing the development of Whisper is largely in the hands of OpenAI, as we don’t have the resources required to add languages to that tool. We could add every possible language to Home Assistant, but if any single part of our voice pipeline lacks language support, it renders voice unusable for that language. As a result, many widely spoken languages were unsupported for local voice control.</p>
<p>This left many users unable to use voice to control their smart home without purchasing extra hardware or services. We’re changing this today with the launch of a key new piece of our voice pipeline.</p>
<h2>Voice for the masses</h2>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-02-voice-chapter-9/stp-logo.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Speech-to-Phrase logo">
<p><a href="https://github.com/OHF-voice/speech-to-phrase">Speech-to-Phrase</a> is based on old, almost ancient, voice technology by today’s standards. Instead of the ability to transcribe virtually any speech into text, it is limited to a set of pre-trained phrases. Speech-to-Phrase will automatically generate the phrases and fine-tune a model based on the devices, areas, and sentence triggers in your Home Assistant server - 100% locally and offline.</p>
<p><strong>The result:</strong> speech transcribed in under a second on a Home Assistant Green or Raspberry Pi 4. The Raspberry Pi 5 processes commands seven times faster, clocking in at 150 milliseconds per command!</p>
<p>With great speed comes <em>some</em> limitations. Speech-to-Phrase only supports a subset of Assist’s voice commands, and more open-ended things like shopping lists, naming a timer, and broadcasts are not usable out of the box. Really any commands that can accept random words (wildcards) will not work. For the same reasons, Speech-to-Phrase is intended for home control only and not LLMs.</p>
<p>The most important home control commands are supported, including turning lights on and off, changing brightness and color, getting the weather, setting timers, and controlling media players. <a href="/docs/automation/trigger/#sentence-trigger">Custom sentences</a> can also be added to trigger things not covered by the current commands, and we expect the community will come up with some clever new ways to use this tech.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-02-voice-chapter-9/green-pe.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Green and Voice PE join forces">
<p align="center"><em>All you need to get started with voice</em></p>
<p>Speech-to-Phrase is launching with support for English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, and Italian - covering nearly 70% of Home Assistant users. Nice. Unlike the local Speech-to-Text tools currently available, adding languages to Speech-to-Phrase is much easier. This means many more languages will be available in future releases, and <a href="/voice_control/contribute-voice">we would love your help</a> adding them!</p>
<p>We’re working on updating the Voice wizard to include Speech-to-Phrase. Until then, you need to install the add-on manually:</p>
<p><a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=core_speech-to-phrase"><img src='https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_addon.svg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="!Open your Home Assistant instance and show the dashboard of an add-on."></a></p>
<h2>Building an Open Voice Ecosystem</h2>
<p>When we launched Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition, we didn’t just launch a product; we kickstarted an ecosystem. We did this by open-sourcing all parts and ensuring that the voice experience built into Home Assistant is not tied to a single product. Any voice assistant built for the Open Home ecosystem can take advantage of all this work. Even your DIY ones!</p>
<p>With ESPHome 2025.2, which we’re releasing next week, any ESPHome-based voice assistant will support making <a href="/blog/2025/02/05/release-20252/#new-broadcast-intent">broadcasts</a> (more on that below), and they will also be able to use our new voice wizard to ensure new users have everything they need to get started.</p>
<p>This will include updates for the <a href="/voice_control/thirteen-usd-voice-remote/">$13 Atom Echo</a> and ESP32-S3-Box-3 devices that we used for development during the Year of the Voice!</p>
<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid="HMqXHN0KBQM" videotitle="New broadcast feature in action with Atom and Box 3"></lite-youtube>New broadcast feature in action with Atom and Box 3</p>
<h2>Large language model improvements</h2>
<p>We aim for Home Assistant to be <a href="/blog/2024/06/07/ai-agents-for-the-smart-home/">the place for experimentation with AI in the smart home</a>. We support a wide range of models, both local and cloud-based, and are constantly improving the different ways people can interact with them. We’re always running <a href="https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports">benchmarks</a> to track the best models, and make sure our changes lead to an improved experience.</p>
<p>If you set up <a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a>, Home Assistant’s built-in voice assistant, and configure it to use an LLM, you might have noticed some new features landing recently. One major change was the new “<a href="/blog/2024/12/04/release-202412/#let-your-voice-assistant-fall-back-to-an-llm-based-agent">prefer handling commands locally</a>” setting, which always attempts to run commands with the built-in conversation agent before it sends it off to an LLM. We noticed many easy-to-run commands were being sent to an LLM, which can slow down things and waste tokens. If Home Assistant understands the command (e.g., turn on the lights), it will perform the necessary action, and only passes it on to your chosen LLM if it doesn’t understand the command (e.g., what’s the air quality like now).</p>
<p>Adding the above features made us realize that LLMs need to understand the commands handled locally. Now, the <a href="/blog/2025/02/05/release-20252/#shared-history-between-the-default-conversation-agent-and-its-llm-based-fallback">conversation history is shared</a> with the LLM. The context allows you to ask the LLM for follow-up questions that refer to recent commands, regardless of whether they helped process the request.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-02-voice-chapter-9/shared-history.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Speech-to-Phrase logo">
<p align="center"><em>Left: without shared conversations. Right: Shared conversations enable GPT to understand context.</em></p>
<h3>Reducing the time to first word with streaming<!-- omit in toc --></h3>
<p>When experimenting with larger models, or on slower hardware, LLM’s can feel sluggish. They only respond once the entire reply is generated, which can take frustratingly long for lengthy responses (you’ll be waiting a while if you ask it to tell you an epic fairy tale).</p>
<p>In Home Assistant 2025.3 we’re introducing support for LLMs to stream their response to the chat, allowing users to start reading while the response is being generated. A bonus side effect is that commands are now also faster: they will be executed as soon as they come in, without waiting for the rest of the message to be complete.</p>
<p>Streaming is coming initially for Ollama and OpenAI.</p>
<h3>Model Context Protocol brings Home Assistant to every AI<!-- omit in toc --></h3>
<p>In November 2024, Anthropic announced the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction">Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP). It is a new protocol to allow LLMs to control external services. In this release, contributed by <a href="https://github.com/allenporter">Allen Porter</a>, Home Assistant can speak MCP.</p>
<p>Using the new Model Context Protocol <a href="/integrations/mcp">integration</a>, Home Assistant can integrate external MCP servers and make their tools available to LLMs that Home Assistant talks to (for your voice assistant or in automations). There is <a href="https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers">quite a collection of MCP servers</a>, including wild ones like scraping websites (<a href="https://gist.github.com/allenporter/b0e9946feb2ab60901c4f467ac1ba6f9">tutorial</a>), file server access, or even BlueSky.</p>
<p>With the new Model Context Protocol <a href="/integrations/mcp_server">server integration</a>, Home Assistant’s LLM tools can be included in other AI apps, like the Claude desktop app (<a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user">tutorial</a>). If agentic AI takes off, your smart home will be ready to be integrated.</p>
<p>Thanks Allen!</p>
<h2>Expanding Voice Capabilities</h2>
<p>We keep enhancing the capabilities of the built-in conversation agent of Home Assistant. With the latest release, we’re unlocking two new features:</p>
<h4>“Broadcast that it’s time for dinner”<!-- omit in toc --></h4>
<p>The new <a href="/blog/2025/02/05/release-20252/#new-broadcast-intent">broadcast</a> feature lets you quickly send messages to the other Assist satellites in your home. This makes it possible to announce it’s time for dinner, or announce battles between your children 😅.</p>
<h4>“Set the temperature to 19 degrees”<!-- omit in toc --></h4>
<p>Previously Assist could only tell you the temperature, but now it can help you change the temperature of your HVAC system. Perfect for changing the temperature while staying cozy under a warm blanket.</p>
<h2>Home Assistant phones home: analog phones are back!</h2>
<p>Two years ago, we introduced the <a href="/voice_control/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/">world’s most private voice assistant</a>: an analog phone! Users can pick it up to talk to their smart home, and only the user can hear the response. A fun feature we’re adding today is that Home Assistant can now <strong>call your analog phone!</strong></p>
<p>Analog phones are great when you want to notify a room, instead of an entire home. For instance, when the laundry is done, you can notify someone in the living room, but not the office. Also since the user needs to pick up the horn to receive the call, you will know if your notification was received.</p>
<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid="TaoNY1gINWc" videotitle="Have your Home Assistant give you a call"></lite-youtube>Have your Home Assistant give you a call</p>
<p>If you’re using an LLM as your voice assistant, you can also start a conversation from a phone call. You can provide the opening sentence and via a new “extra system prompt” option, provide extra context to the LLM to interpret the response from the user. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>Extra system context: garage door cover.garage_door was left open for 30 minutes. We asked the user if it should be closed</li>
<li>Assistant: should the garage door be closed?</li>
<li>User: sure</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://github.com/jaminh">JaminH</a> for the contribution.</p>
<h2>Wyoming improvements</h2>
<p>Wyoming is our standard for linking together all the different parts needed to build a voice assistant. Home Assistant 2025.3 will add support for announcements to Wyoming satellites, making them eligible for the new broadcast feature too.  </p>
<p>We’re also adding a new microWakeWord add-on (the same wake word engine running on Voice PE!) that can be used as an alternative to openWakeWord. As we collect more real-world samples from our <a href="https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/">Wake Word Collective</a>, the models included in microWakeWord will be retrained and improved.</p>
<h2>🫵 Help us bring choice to voice!</h2>
<p>We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again—the era of open voice has begun, and the more people who join us, the better it gets. Home Assistant offers many ways to start with voice control, whether by <a href="/voice_control/#expand-and-experiment">building your own</a> Assist hardware or getting a <a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a>. With every update, you’ll see new features, and you’ll get to preview the future of voice today.</p>
<p>A huge thanks to all the language leaders and contributors helping to shape open voice in the home! There are many ways to get involved, from translating or sharing voice samples to building new features—learn more about how <a href="/voice_control/contribute-voice">you can contribute here</a>. Another great way to support development is by subscribing to <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a>, which helps fund the Open Home projects that power voice.</p>

<h2>Iterating on backups</h2>
<p>In the previous release, we <a href="/blog/2025/01/03/release-20251/#overhaul-of-the-backup-system">fully revamped the entire backup experience</a>
and added many new features to make it easier to use. That release set the
stage for the next iterations and opened up the ability for integrations to
provide locations to store backups.</p>
<p>We’ve received <strong>a lot</strong> of feedback on the new backup system, which is awesome! ❤️
All the feedback helped us prioritize the most requested features, and other
improvements to the backup system.</p>
<p>This release includes a lot of the most requested improvements and abilities.</p>
<h3>Unencrypted backups</h3>
<p>The new backup system came with a lot of security improvements, including
encryption of backups. However, as it turns out, many users use these backups
to extract and restore single files or configurations, a use case in which
encryption made things more difficult. In this release we made two changes
to the backup system to address this.</p>
<h4>Ability to turn off encryption for specific locations</h4>
<p>While our default recommendation remains to encrypt backups, as of this
release, you can turn off encryption on a per location basis. This allows you
to store backups on you local NAS, for example, in an unencrypted format.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the option to turn off encryption for a specific backup location." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-turn-off-encryption.png" />
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup locations, one location indicates that encryption has been turned off." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-encryption-turned-off.png" />
<p>There is one exception to this, which is <a href="/cloud">Home Assistant Cloud</a>. Backups
stored in Home Assistant Cloud will always be encrypted, and encryption cannot
be turned off. At Nabu Casa, we take your privacy and security very seriously,
and we never ever want to be able to access your data.</p>
<h4>Downloading backups unencrypted</h4>
<p>When downloading backups from the Home Assistant interface, you will now always
download the backup in an unencrypted format that can be extracted using your
favorite archive tool.</p>
<p>This works for all backups, regardless of the encryption settings of the
location in which they are stored. For instance, if you download an encrypted
backup from Home Assistant Cloud through the Home Assistant interface,
it will decrypt the backup on the fly while you download it.</p>
<h3>Customize the time of your backups</h3>
<p>The initial iteration of the backup system scheduled backups to run at 4:45 AM,
but this time wasn’t ideal for everyone. Some, for example, turned off their
network storage during the night, meaning the backup would fail.</p>
<p>This release, we added the ability to customize the time of your backups to your
liking. Additionally, if you choose to make weekly backups, you can now select
the days of the week you want the backup to run.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup configuration options, you can now set your own time and select which days to backup." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-customize-backups-change.png" />
<h3>Taking backups on an advanced schedule</h3>
<p>The above backup time changes not flexible enough for you? Well, you are in luck! In this
release, we added an action (<code>backup.create_automatic</code>) that you can use
to trigger a backup, with your preferred settings, in an automation.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing an automation in the automation editor that is using the new action to create an automated backup." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-action.png" />
<p>This allows you to create automated backups on any schedule you like, or even
add conditions and actions around it. For example, you could make an automation
that triggers on a calendar, wakes up your network storage, waits till it is
online, and then starts a backup.</p>
<h3>Re-introduction of the backup toggle on update</h3>
<p>If you run Home Assistant OS, you get updates for Home Assistant along with
all your add-ons. The update dialog used to have a toggle to create a backup
before updating, which was removed in the previous release.</p>
<p>This change was made because this feature was considered redundant when running
regular automated backups. However, we’ve received a lot of feedback that many
people relied on these backups to ensure they had the latest data, for instance,
if they needed to roll back to a previous version of an add-on. We are
re-introducing this backup on update toggle in this release, but in a smarter
way. 🤓</p>
<h4>Backup on updating Home Assistant</h4>
<p>When updating Home Assistant, the toggle is now turned off by default and
shows the last time you made a backup. This allows you to decide whether to make
a new backup before updating.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing an Home Assistant Core update dialog, giving the option to make a backup before update." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-before-update-core.png" />
<p>If you turn the switch on, a full automated backup is created and synced to
your configured locations, before the update is started.</p>
<p>This full sync is done to ensure you have the most recent backup available in
case the update causes issues and you need to restore your system. In the rare
case a Home Assistant update fatally fails and you can’t access the backup page,
if you’ve configured a second backup location, you’ll be able to download it
from there.</p>
<h4>Backup on updating add-ons</h4>
<p>Things are slightly different when updating add-ons. The toggle exists here too,
and is disabled by default. However, when you enable it, only a backup of your
add-on and its data is created. That way you can keep around the previous
version of the add-on, so you can always roll back to it if needed.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing an Home Assistant add-on update dialog, giving the option to make a backup before update." src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-addons-before-update.png" />
<p>To prevent your system from filling up with old add-on backups, we only retain
one backup per add-on, automatically deleting the previous backup whenever
a new one is created. Add-on backups you created manually, of course,
remain untouched and will not be deleted automatically.</p>
<h3>Improved filenames for backups</h3>
<p>One piece of feedback we’ve seen a lot, is that the filenames created by backups
can be a bit cryptic and hard to understand for humans.</p>
<p>This feedback was fair, as the filename was a hash and originally not designed
to be human-readable. This method was not newly introduced in the last release,
but it was made more apparent with the new backup system and locations.</p>
<p>So, in this release, we’ve improved the filenames of the backups stored on your
backup locations. The filename now includes the date and time the backup was
created, making it easier to understand and identify the backup you are looking
for, even outside of Home Assistant.</p>
<h3>New locations</h3>
<p>This release also introduces new locations to store your backups. There are new
integrations for <a href="/integrations/google_drive/">Google Drive</a> and
<a href="/integrations/onedrive/">Microsoft OneDrive</a>, and backup support was added to
the <a href="/integrations/synology_dsm">Synology DSM</a> integration.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup configuration panel, with all possible backup integrations set up!" src="/images/blog/2025-02/backups-new-locations.png" />
<h2>Voice</h2>
<p>Assist, our <a href="/voice_control/">private voice assistant</a>, is getting a few new
features in this release. If you don’t have Assist set up yet, check out our
<a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice: Preview Edition</a> to get started.</p>
<h3>Home Assistant will be able to call your analog phone to tell you a message</h3>
<p>Remember our tutorial on turning an analog phone into the
<a href="/voice_control/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/">world’s most private voice assistant</a>?
Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jaminh">Jamin</a>, we now have a way to call
your analog phone from Home Assistant!</p>
<p>You can use <a href="/integrations/assist_satellite#action-assist_satelliteannounce"><code>assist_satellite.announce</code></a>
to have Home Assistant call your phone and play a message when someone picks up
the phone.</p>
<p>If you use an LLM as the brains for your voice assistant, you can take this one
step further with the new <a href="/integrations/assist_satellite#action-assist_satellitestart_conversation"><code>assist_satellite.start_conversation</code></a>
action. Instead of playing an announcement, it starts a conversation between
Home Assistant and the user, with Home Assistant saying the first message.
Left the garage door open for 30 minutes? No problem, let Home Assistant call
and ask if they want to close it.</p>
<p><em>(Starting a conversation with the default conversation agent is a bit more work
and did not make it this release).</em></p>
<h3>New Broadcast intent</h3>
<p>You can now broadcast messages to every other voice assistant in your home.
Try it by saying <em>“Broadcast it is time for dinner”</em>.
As always with new intents, support may vary
<a href="https://home-assistant.github.io/intents/">depending on your language</a>,
but our language leaders are working hard on making sure it will be supported
soon in your language!</p>
<h3>Setting Temperature on Thermostat</h3>
<p>A few releases ago we introduced an intent to get the current temperature from
a climate device. As of this release, you can also set the target temperature
of your thermostat by voice.</p>
<p>By saying <em>“Set the temperature to 19 degrees”</em> this will smartly target the
area you are in (if you have a thermostat per area, such as thermostatic valves
on your radiators) or the floor you are in (if you only have a central unit).
You can also target specific devices by name if you prefer.</p>
<h3>LLMs meet calendars</h3>
<p>Without complex custom tooling, LLM-based conversation agents previously could
not fetch events from your calendar. This release changes that. Out of the box,
LLM-based agents can now retrieve today’s and this week’s events from any of
your calendars. Don’t forget to
<a href="/voice_control/voice_remote_expose_devices/">expose your calendar entities</a>
to enable this functionality.</p>
<h3>Shared history between the default conversation agent and its LLM-based fallback</h3>
<p>In <a href="/blog/2024/12/04/release-202412/">2024.12</a> we introduced a lovely feature
that allowed you to use our fast and local default conversation agent for most
queries while still being able to fall back to a much more powerful LLM-based
agent for more complex queries.</p>
<p>This introduced some interesting behaviors. From a user perspective, it looked
like you were talking to the same assistant, whereas, in reality, nothing was
shared between the two agents. This led to some less-than-optimal scenarios,
such as this one:</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of missing history in the conversation" src="/images/blog/2025-02/conversation-history-before.png" />
<p>The first command is processed locally by our default agent, but the follow-up
request is processed by the LLM-based agent. Since no memory is shared, it does
not understand what device you want to turn off.</p>
<p>Starting with this release, both agents now share the same command history,
helping address this issue.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new improved behavior" src="/images/blog/2025-02/conversation-history-after.png" />
<h3>Model Context Protocol</h3>
<p>This release adds the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction">Model Context Protocol</a>
to Home Assistant thanks to <a href="https://github.com/allenporter">Allen</a>. Home Assistant can both be an
<a href="/integrations/mcp_server/">MCP server</a> and an
<a href="/integrations/mcp/">MCP client</a>. From the MCP website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To give it a try yourself, <a href="https://gist.github.com/allenporter/b0e9946feb2ab60901c4f467ac1ba6f9">check out this client demo</a>.</p>

and select the <strong>Bluetooth</strong> integration, and next select <strong>Configure</strong>.</p>
<p>This new panel gives you access to the Bluetooth integration options and
insights into the connection slot allocations. More importantly,
it has an advertisement monitor!</p>
<p>Selecting <strong>Advertisement monitor</strong> will open a new panel, where you can see
information about your Bluetooth devices, including the raw advertisement data
and how they are connected to your Home Assistant instance. This includes
which <a href="/integrations/bluetooth/#remote-adapters-bluetooth-proxies">Bluetooth proxy</a> it connects through!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new advertisement panel" src="/images/blog/2025-02/bluetooth-panel.png" />
<h2>Preparing our graphs for the future</h2>
<p>This release includes a major overhaul of every graph we display and show in
Home Assistant. We have entirely replaced the software library that renders
these graphs in the frontend.</p>
<p>You can most definitely tell things have changed, but everything still looks
very similar. The latter was our goal for now, as we wanted the existing
experience to be familiar.</p>
<p>However, this change is a preparation for the future. We have many plans and
ideas for our graphs, and this change was a necessary step to make those plans
possible.</p>
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.2 in February.
These patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch
release every Friday.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-01-backups/art.jpg' alt="3 2 1 backup">
<p>Home Assistant is a powerful tool that can save you time and money by automating your home. Pretty important things around the home, from heating to an automatic fish feeder, need to depend on it. However, as your setup grows more complex, maintaining it—what we call <em>“digital housekeeping”</em>—can become a time-consuming task. Backups are a critical part of this maintenance, yet they’re often overlooked, especially by new users, often until it is too late when disaster strikes.</p>
<p>To make backups effortless, we’ve introduced new automated and off-site backup features in <a href="/blog/2025/01/03/release-20251/">the latest release of Home Assistant</a>. These improvements will make it easier than ever to safeguard your setup. As we step into the New Year, we would encourage you to adopt a simple yet crucial resolution: regularly back up your data. With our new tools, it takes just five minutes to set up and provides lasting peace of mind.</p>

<h2>What’s in a backup?</h2>
<p>Backups are essential for a reliable smart home. They protect your system from hardware failures, natural disasters, and cyberattacks, allowing you to quickly restore operations. A solid backup strategy follows the 3-2-1 rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 copies of your data</li>
<li>2 stored on different media</li>
<li>1 kept off-site</li>
</ul>
<p>While this may seem excessive, consider a scenario like a lightning strike: both your Home Assistant system and any local storage, like network-attached storage (NAS), could be destroyed. That’s why an off-site backup is non-negotiable for true resilience, and a comprehensive backup strategy should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular and frequent backups of critical data</li>
<li>Following the 3-2-1 rule for redundancy</li>
<li>Encrypting backups to protect against theft and corruption</li>
<li>Testing backups to ensure they are functional</li>
<li>Defining how long backups should be retained</li>
</ul>
<p>To support these best practices, we have worked hard to introduce Automatic Backups and seamless integration with off-site backup location providers, such as <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a>. These updates, part of <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#home-assistant-cloud-peace-of-mind">our 2024 roadmap</a>, make it easier than ever to provide peace of mind to our users, by implementing a robust backup strategy, and keep your smart home running smoothly.</p>
<h2>Backups have never been this easy</h2>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-01-backups/backups.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="the backup page">
<p>Home Assistant backups are incredibly good, backing up every setting and add-on, making restores feel a bit like magic. It even works across different CPU architectures! Up until recently setting up a 3-2-1 backup strategy in Home Assistant was not entirely straightforward. This changes with Home Assistant 2025.1, where we’re elevating our backup experience with three new important features.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic encrypted backups</strong> - You can now schedule automatic backups every night or once a week, ensuring you always have a recent backup at hand.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic cleanup</strong> - No longer worry about backups overrunning your disk space, as you can now set the maximum number of backups that should be stored.</li>
<li><strong>Backup locations</strong> - We have added a new system for integrations to provide backup locations (also known as <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/platform/backup">backup agents</a>), allowing you to sync backups to both local or off-site storage. It’s launching with support for <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/storage/">network shares</a> and <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> (included at no additional cost to subscribers), with more locations to follow.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Get started with our Backup Wizard</h3>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-01-backups/wizard.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="the backup wizard">
<p>The new automatic backup feature in Home Assistant 2025.1 comes with a new easy to use backup wizard. With a couple of clicks, you can backup your Home Assistant system on a regular schedule and easily choose the places where backups are stored. New users will be prompted with a wizard to make sure they set up automatic encrypted backups. Selecting the recommended settings ensures that a backup is made every night, that three backups are kept, and that they are uploaded to all available locations.</p>
<h3>Backup locations</h3>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-01-backups/locations.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="backup locations">
<p>At launch, only a few backup locations will be available, but we’ve made it easy for developers to integrate more, so expect a lot of options to follow. As part of this renewed focus on smart home resilience set out in <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#next-priority-encrypted-cloud-backup">our roadmap</a>, cloud backup has been added to <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a>, which will be available day one to all subscribers for no additional cost. It will only store the latest backup, which must be under 5GB (you’ll be notified to repair it if it is too large to upload). If you lose your other backups, you can always go to <a href="https://account.nabucasa.com/">your Cloud account page</a> and download the latest backup.</p>
<p>New Home Assistant features like this supercharged backup capability is only possible with funding from our Home Assistant Cloud subscribers. Adding backup to the subscription at no additional cost, was the least we could do to thank them for their continued support.</p>
<h3>Secure by default</h3>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-01-backups/encrypt.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Encryption key page">
<p>Backups contain all Home Assistant data, including all the keys to every integrated device in your smart home and the history of how you live your life. This data is very important to keep secure. With automatic backups and the 3-2-1 approach we are promoting to users to store their backups off-site. This is why all automatic backups are fully encrypted.</p>
<p>When a user configures automatic backups, they will be presented with the encryption key and the option to download an emergency kit. The emergency kit contains all the important information, including a link to <a href="/more-info/backup-emergency-kit">the instructions on how to use it to restore a backup</a>. If you were to ever delete your emergency kit, it is available to re-download in the <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/backup/">backup configuration page</a>.</p>
<h4>Apply 3-2-1 to your backups</h4>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="nSSkMVBqChM" videotitle="How to setup automatic backups"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>Check out the above video tutorial or read our docs to learn more about setting up <a href="/integrations/backup/">automatic and off-site backups</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Too often, people just starting their smart home journey move forward a little too fast and make a mistake that causes some downtime. This impacts the household’s confidence, as something that should be making their lives easier is actually seen as unreliable. Avoid this early pitfall and build a resilient smart home with 3-2-1 backups.</p>

<h2>Overhaul of the backup system</h2>
<p>Let’s talk about backups. Let’s be honest: they’re one of the most important yet
often overlooked tasks. But when disaster strikes, like a hardware failure,
having a reliable backup can save the day. Wouldn’t you love to be back up and
running after disaster strikes?</p>
<p>While Home Assistant’s previous backup system has proven to be solid
and reliable over the years, it didn’t exactly make following best
practices—like regular backups, encryption, and off-site
storage—easy. Many of you had to rely on custom add-ons, automations,
or blueprints for backups to fill the gaps.</p>
<p><strong>That changes with this release! 🎉</strong></p>
<p>We’ve completely reworked the Home Assistant backup experience to help you set
up a solid backup strategy, using best practices in just a few clicks;
giving you peace of mind when it comes to your backups.</p>
<p>No worries, if you are using any custom solution for backups, they will continue
to work today. Even with everything new, we’ve made sure to keep everything
backward compatible.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let’s dive into the new backup system!</p>
<h3>Automated backups 🤖</h3>
<p>Yes, you read that right—Home Assistant now supports automated backups!</p>
<p>Using a schedule, backups will be created on a regular basis without you having
to lift a finger. This ensures you always have a recent backup available,
without having to worry about it.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the bew backup overview page which shows you exactly when your last backup took place" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-status.png" />
<p>When you navigate to your backups in the settings menu, you will be
greeted with a new overview page that shows you exactly when your last backup
took place and when the next one is scheduled. Instant peace of mind!</p>
<p>Automated backups are taking place at 4:45 AM. So, while everyone in your home
is sleeping, Home Assistant makes sure your data is safe and sound. Backing up
at this early hour also means Home Assistant is done with its internal database
maintenance, ensuring your backup is as compact as possible.</p>
<p>If something ever goes wrong during the automated scheduled backup process,
Home Assistant will notify you through the repair center, ensuring you are
aware of it and can take action.</p>
<h3>Triggering an off-schedule automated backup 👆</h3>
<p>Automated backups on a schedule are great, but sometimes, you might want to
trigger a backup <strong>right now</strong>! Maybe you are about to make big changes or
upgrade a whole bunch of things during an evening of tinkering.</p>
<p>No worries! You can now trigger an off-schedule automated backup from the backup
page at any time. This will immediately create a backup with the same
configuration as your scheduled automated backups.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup now button + dialog that allows you to trigger an off-schedule backup at any time" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-backup-now.png" />
<p>The ability to trigger an on-demand automated backup is excellent, as it covers
all your backup settings in a single click. However, the ability to create
manual backups also still exists. This allows you to create a very specific
backup with the exact contents you want to have in it.</p>
<h3>Home Assistant Cloud backups 😎</h3>
<p>Are you a <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/">Home Assistant Cloud by Nabu Casa</a> subscriber? Then you’re in for a
treat! You can now automatically store your latest, fully encrypted, backup in
your Home Assistant Cloud account.</p>
<p><strong>This feature provides 5GB of storage at no extra cost, offering fully
encrypted off-site protection for your data! 🎁</strong></p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Home Assistant Cloud is now a backup target location, that is included with the Home Assistant Cloud subscription at no additional costs" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-home-assistant-cloud.png" />
<p>The backup can be downloaded from Home Assistant itself, but also from the
<a href="https://account.nabucasa.com/">Home Assistant Cloud account page</a> @ Nabu Casa
in case you need it. This way, you can always access your latest backup, even
in case your Home Assistant hardware completely fails.</p>
<h3>Backup locations are extendable by design 🧩</h3>
<p>So, automated backups can be stored on your local disk and in Home Assistant
Cloud, but what if you want to store your backups somewhere else?</p>
<p>Choice is an important aspect of Home Assistant; we want to make everything as
flexible as possible without vendor lock-in. Therefore, the backup system
is designed to be <strong>extendable</strong>.</p>
<p>This means <strong>integrations</strong> can offer new storage locations—such as NAS devices,
Google Drive, Backblaze B2, or other storage providers—in the future.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing an potential example storage provider provided by an integration" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-integration-location.png" />
<p>Currently, this feature is brand new ✨, so <strong>no</strong> integrations offer additional
locations yet. However, we expect to see a few more integrations that provide
backup locations in the next release.</p>
<p>This extensibility ensures you can store your backups where you want them,
giving you the flexibility and choice to choose the storage solution you
prefer and trust.</p>
<h3>Encrypted backups by default 🔒</h3>
<p>With the addition of Home Assistant Cloud as an off-site backup location, and
the potential for integrations to offer even more (off-site) backup locations,
security has become more important than ever. Your backups not only contain the
access credentials to your smart home devices but also the history of your home,
and no one should be able to access information that sensitive! <strong>Ever!</strong></p>
<p>That is why all backups are now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-128</a> encrypted by default. To prioritize
your backups’ security we replaced the previous optional password
with a mandatory encryption key.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="The new backup overview page shows you exactly when your last backup took place" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-encryption.png" />
<p>When you set up your backups for the first time, an encryption key will be
generated for you. Make sure to store this key in a safe place, as you will need
it to restore your backups. To make this easier, you can download the key as
part of an emergency kit during setup—or anytime later from the backup settings
page. Keep it safe! 🔑</p>
<h3>Restoring backups available to all installation methods 🤗</h3>
<p>More good news—restoring backups is now supported across
<strong>all installation methods!</strong> 🎉</p>
<p>Previously, only Home Assistant OS installations could restore backups. But
with this release, this feature is now available for all installation methods!
No matter how you run Home Assistant, even if you use our containers in a Docker
environment, you can now restore your Home Assistant backups.</p>
<p>This also means you can restore backups from local storage, Home Assistant
Cloud, or any future backup locations added through integrations.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, all backup features, including everything we release today,
will be available regardless of the installation method you are using. We want
everyone to have a solid backup strategy.</p>
<h3>Backup retention 🗑</h3>
<p>Our previous backup system made solid backups, which was good, but if you didn’t
clean them up manually, eventually, you’d annoyingly run out of disk space. 😬</p>
<p>So! Backup retention is now a thing! You can now configure how many backups you
want to keep, and Home Assistant will handle the rest.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="You can now configure a retention policy for your backups, allowing Home Assistant to clean it up automatically" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-retention.png" />
<p>This cleanup will happen automatically after each backup. If you create a backup
manually for whatever reason, those will remain untouched, giving you full
control over special cases and workflows.</p>
<h3>Setting up backups for the first time 🚀</h3>
<p>Getting started with the new backup system is quick and easy!</p>
<p>The first time you open the backup settings after upgrading, you will be greeted
by a <strong>setup wizard</strong> that will guide you through setting up your backups
step-by-step.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the our friendly wizard that will help you setting up your backups" src="/images/blog/2025-01/backups-wizard.png" />
<p>The wizard will help you set up your encryption key, configure your backup
frequency, and set up your backup retention policy. And when it is ready, it
will immediately kick off your first backup!</p>
<p>All set! One less thing to worry about 🎉</p>
<h3>3…2…1… Backups 🎊</h3>
<p>We are super excited about this new backup system! As we enter the new year,
we encourage you to get serious about your backups.
A good New Year’s resolution, maybe? 😉</p>
<p>So, stop what you are doing right now and set up your backups! Go ahead and set
up that 3-2-1 backup strategy. Not sure what that is?</p>
<p><strong>You can read all about it in our <a href="/blog/2025/01/03/3-2-1-backup/">3…2…1… Backup blog post</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Month of “What the Heck?!”</h2>
<p>December’s <strong><a href="/blog/2024/11/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck/">Month of “What the Heck?!”</a></strong>
was an absolute blast! 🎉</p>
<p>A big thank you to everyone who contributed by sharing their “What the Heck?!”
moments and ideas for improving Home Assistant. Your input is incredibly
valuable and helps shape our roadmap and priorities moving forward.</p>
<p>Quite a bunch of shared “What the Heck?!” moments have been addressed in this
release already 🚀 —and we’re not stopping there! Expect to see even more
improvements inspired by your feedback in upcoming releases.</p>
<h3>Setting categories and labels when creating automations and scripts</h3>
<p>For the first WTH item that has been resolved, we have <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a> to thank!

<p>Yeah, that is a good WTH! Whenever you create a new automation or script, you
probably want to organize it right away and not have to go back to the settings.
<strong>FIXED</strong>! 🎉</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="If you press the d on your keyboard, it will pop up the Quickbar for devices" src="/images/blog/2025-01/wth-category-labels-new-automation.png" />
<p>When you create a new automation or script, and also when renaming it,
you can now set the description, category, labels, and areas right away!
🏷️ Nice!</p>
<h3>Quickly navigate to a device</h3>
<p>You might be aware that you can bring up our quick navigation bar anywhere in
Home Assistant by pressing the <code>c</code> key on your keyboard to navigate various
places and the <code>e</code> key to search and navigate to any entity. However…</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-is-there-no-quick-bar-for-devices/802310"><em><strong>“WTH is there no quick bar for devices?”</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Well, that is a good question that Andreas Brett raised! There is indeed no
such thing for devices. <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a> to the rescue! You can now navigate to any
device using the quick bar by pressing the <code>d</code> key on your keyboard.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="If you press the d on your keyboard, it will pop up the quick bar for devices" src="/images/blog/2025-01/wth-quickbar-devices.png"/>
<h3>Zoom &amp; Pan for charts</h3>
<p>KNXBroker raised the following WTH topic:</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-lets-upgrade-history-graphs/802568"><em><strong>“WTH lets upgrade History Graphs”</strong></em></a></p>
<p>You are right! The history graphs in Home Assistant are basic but functional!
Nevertheless, we can do better! 🚀</p>
<p>One of the bigger items in that WTH topic was the ability to zoom and pan…
Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/MindFreeze">@MindFreeze</a>, you can now zoom and pan in any graph
in Home Assistant! 📈</p>
<p class="img">
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Zoom any graph in Home Assistant, by holding ctrl or command and scrolling your mouse wheel!" src="/images/blog/2025-01/wth-zoom-graphs.gif"/>
Zoom and drag any graph in Home Assistant, by holding ctrl (or command on mac)
and scrolling your mouse wheel!
</p>
<p>Hold the control key (or command on macOS) and scroll to zoom in and out using
your mouse. You can also click and drag to pan around the zoomed graph.</p>
<p>In addition to this change, <a href="https://github.com/MindFreeze">@MindFreeze</a> enabled small micro-animation for the
history graphs, making them look more alive and less static.</p>
<h3>Controlling the default exposure of new entities to Assist</h3>
<p>mathd made the following point in a Month of “What the Heck?!” topic:</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-are-all-new-entities-exposed-to-assist-by-default/803889"><em>“WTH Are all new entities exposed to Assist by default?”</em></a></p>
<p>We hear you! Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a>, you can now control the default exposure of
new entities to Assist. You can now toggle this on or off in the Home Assistant
Voice Assistant settings.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Zoom any graph in Home Assistant, by holding ctrl or command and scroll your mouse wheel!" src="/images/blog/2025-01/wth-default-expose-to-assist.png" />
<h3>More “What the Heck?!” improvements</h3>
<p>Many smaller improvements originate from the Month of “What the Heck?!” in this
release. Here are some of the other noteworthy ones:</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-there-is-no-hotkey-for-assist/802403"><em><strong>“WTH there is no hotkey for Assist”</strong></em></a>**</p>
<p>Well, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a>, you can now press the <code>a</code> key on your keyboard
anywhere in Home Assistant to summon Assist! 🎙️ Nice!</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-doesnt-ha-ask-if-i-want-to-save-automations/804030"><em><strong>“WTH doesn’t HA ask if I want to save automations?”</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Whoa! That is a good one! Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a>, Home Assistant will now ask if
you want to save your automation before leaving the editor if there are unsaved
changes. 🤖</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-is-in-energy-dashboard-the-individual-devices-not-able-to-reorder/805051"><em><strong>“WTH Is in Energy Dashboard the individual devices not able to reorder”</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Thanks for that one yormedia! Honestly, this one has been raised in previous
editions of the Month of “What the Heck?!” a few times. Reason enough for
<a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a> to pick this up and make it happen! You can now reorder them in
the setting for categorization purposes. 🔡</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-cant-i-filter-labels-within-a-table-filter/802529"><em><strong>“WTH Can’t I filter labels within a table filter?”</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Good question. If you have a lot of labels, scrolling through the list of labels
in the filter option can be a bit cumbersome. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/silamon">@silamon</a>, you can
now search and filter through the labels in the filter option! 🔎</p>
<p><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-sentence-trigger-doesnt-contain-any-context/802386"><em><strong>WTH sentence trigger doesn’t contain any context</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Great idea! Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a>, the full conversation input is now available
to sentence triggers! 🗣️ This was actually the first WTH item to be resolved in
this edition! 😎</p>

integrations are also being constantly improved. Here are some of the noteworthy
changes to existing integrations:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Now available to set up from the UI</h3>
<p>While most <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.</p>
<p>The following integration is now available via the Home Assistant UI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/niko_home_control">Niko Home Control</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/VandeurenGlenn">@VandeurenGlenn</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Farewell to the following</h3>
<p>The following <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> are also no longer available as
of this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DTE Energy Bridge</strong> has been removed after being deprecated. The integration
was no longer functional.</li>
<li><strong>Simulated</strong> has been previously deprecated and is now removed.</li>
<li><strong>Stookalert</strong> has been removed. The upstream data is no longer updated.
The <a href="/integrations/stookwijzer">Stookwijzer</a> integration is a good alternative to get the same information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>When viewing data tables and using <code>ctrl+f</code> in your browser to search, the
search input will now be focused automatically. As native browser searches
will not work on data tables. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/marcinbauer85">@marcinbauer85</a> adjusted the “Add card” dialog, to automatically focus on the
search field when you add a card, so you can start typing to search
right away! Nice touch!</li>
<li>Images uploaded through Home Assistant (for example, as background or as a
user profile picture) are now browsable in the media browser.
Thanks <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a>!</li>
<li>The unit of measurement is now shown next to the numeric slider in the
more-info dialog of number entities. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/abmantis">@abmantis</a>!</li>
<li>Home Assistant now supports <code>mWh</code> as a unit of measurement for energy sensors
and <code>mW</code> for electrical potential power sensors. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/agners">@agners</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wendevlin">@wendevlin</a> added settings and category overflow actions to the automation
and script editor (the three-dotted menu in the top right corner), making
it easier to access those straight from the editor. Nice!</li>
<li>The <a href="/dashboards/logbook/">logbook card</a> supports picking a target for things it should show
events for. You can now pick based on entities, devices, areas,  floors,
and labels! Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/silamon">@silamon</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dashboard background settings</h2>
<p>A few releases ago, we made adding a background image to your dashboard easier.
This release, <a href="https://github.com/silamon">@silamon</a> takes it a step further by adding a lot of settings
to customize how the background image is displayed.</p>
<p>This includes support for tiled backgrounds, transparency, size settings,
alignment, and allowing the background to scroll with the page or stay fixed.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="You can now fully customize the background of your dashboard, with the options to changing tiling, transparency, alignment, and size seettings" src="/images/blog/2025-01/dashboards-background-settings.png" />
<p>Nice! Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/silamon">@silamon</a>!</p>
<h2>Media player volume feature for Tile card</h2>
<p>This is a super nice addition from <a href="https://github.com/simon-zumbrunnen">@simon-zumbrunnen</a>! The Tile card now
supports a media player volume slider feature. This feature allows you to
control the volume of a media player directly from the Tile card. 🔉
Nice work Simon!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="The tile card with a media player entity, having the volume feature slider enabled" src="/images/blog/2025-01/tile-card-feature-volume-slider.png" />
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.1 in January.

<p><strong>TL;DR: <a href="/voice-pe/">Check out the product page</a></strong></p>
<p>We all deserve a voice assistant that doesn’t harvest our data and arbitrarily limit features. In the same way Home Assistant made private and local home automation a viable option, we believe the same can, and must be done for voice assistants.</p>
<p>Since we began developing our open-source voice assistant for Home Assistant, one key element has been missing - great hardware that’s simple to set up and use. Hardware that hears you, gives you clear feedback, and seamlessly fits into the home. Affordable and high-quality voice hardware will let more people join in on its development and allow anyone to <em>preview</em> the future of voice assistants today. Setting a standard for the next several years to base our development around.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/vpe-packaging.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Voice Preview Edition with packaging"></p>
<p>We’re launching <a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a> to help accelerate our goal of not only matching the capabilities of existing voice assistants but surpassing them. This is inevitable: They’ll focus their efforts on monetizing voice, while our community will be focused on improving open and private voice. We’ll support the languages big tech ignores and provide a real choice in how you run voice in your home.</p>
<p><strong>The era of open, private voice assistants begins now, and we’d love for you to be part of it.</strong></p>

<h2>Introducing Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</h2>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/voice-preview-edition.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Voice Preview Edition with packaging">
<p>Our main goal with Voice Preview Edition was to make the best hardware to get started with <a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a>, Home Assistant’s built-in voice assistant. If you’re already using other third-party hardware to run Assist, this will be a big upgrade. We prioritized its ability to hear commands, giving it an industry-leading dedicated audio processor and dual microphones - I’m always blown away by how well it picks up my voice around the room.</p>
<p>Next, we ensured it would blend into the home, giving it a sleek but unobtrusive design. That’s not to say it doesn’t have flair. When you get your hands on Voice Preview Edition the first thing you’ll notice is its premium-feeling injection-molded shell, which is semi-transparent, just like your favorite ‘90s tech. The LED ring is also really eye-catching, and you can customize it to your heart’s content from full gamer RGB to subtle glow.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
<img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/vpe-finish.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="3 different views of Voice Preview Edition">
</div>
<p>It’s hard to convey how nice the rotary dial is to use; its subtle clicks paired with LED animations are hard not to play with. Most importantly, the dial lets anyone in your home intuitively adjust the volume. The same can be said for the multipurpose button and mute switch (which physically cuts power to the microphone for ultimate privacy). We knew for it to work best, it needed to be out in the open, and let’s just say that <a href="https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/open-home-approval-factor/#:~:text=2023.1%20release%20notes.-,Home%20Approval%20Factor,-We%20have%20a">Home Approval Factor</a> was very front of mind when designing it.</p>
<p>We also worked hard to keep the price affordable and comparable to other voice assistant hardware at just $59 (that’s the recommended MSRP, and pricing will vary by retailer). This isn’t a preorder, it’s available now!</p>

<h3>Why Preview Edition</h3>
<p>For some, our voice assistant is all they need; they just want to say a couple of commands, set timers, manage their shopping list, and control their most used devices. For others, we understand they want to ask their voice assistant to make whale sounds or to tell them how tall Taylor Swift is - this voice assistant doesn’t entirely do those things (<a href="/voice_control/assist_create_open_ai_personality/">yet</a>). We think there is still more we can do before this is ready for every home, and until then, we’ll be selling this <em>Preview</em> of the future of voice assistants. We’ve built the best hardware on the market, and set a new standard for the coming years, allowing us to focus our development as we prepare our voice assistant for every home. Taking back our privacy isn’t for everyone - it’s a journey - and we want as many people as possible to join us early and make it better.</p>
<h3>Built for Home Assistant</h3>
<p>Many other voice assistants work with Home Assistant, but this one was <em>built</em> for Home Assistant. Unlike other voice hardware that can work with Assist, this doesn’t require flashing firmware or any assembly. You plug it into power, and it is seamlessly discovered by Home Assistant. A wizard instantly starts helping you set up your voice assistant, but critically, if you haven’t used voice before, it will quickly guide you through what you need to get the best experience.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/wizard.webp' alt="Video of Assist wizard">Get up and running with Voice Preview Edition in minutes with our new wizard</a>
<p>This is not a DIY product. We’ve worked to make the experience as smooth as possible, with easy and fast updates and settings you can manage from the Home Assistant UI.</p>
<h3>Advanced audio processing</h3>
<p>If you have been following our work on voice, you know we’ve tried a lot of different voice assistant hardware. Most available Assist-capable hardware is bad at its most important job - hearing your voice and then providing audiovisual feedback. That was really what drove us to build Voice Preview Edition.</p>
<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid="DS_8cDZKBPc" videotitle="Music Assistant - VPE"></lite-youtube>Voice Preview Editions mics and audio processors effortlessly hear commands through loud music it is playing</p>
<p>Our Assist software could only do so much with substandard audio, and its functionality is massively improved with clear audio. The dual microphones combined with the XMOS audio processing chip are what makes it so capable. Together, they allow Voice Preview Edition to have echo cancellation, stationary noise removal, and auto gain control, which all adds up to clearer audio. This combined with an ESP32-S3 with 8 MB of octal PSRAM - one of the fastest ESP and RAM combinations available - makes for an incredibly responsive device. This is the best Assist hardware you can buy today, and it will continue to give a great experience as Assist’s feature set expands in the years to come.</p>
<h3>Bringing choice to voice</h3>
<p>Assist can do something almost no other voice assistant can achieve - <em>it can run without the internet</em> 🤯. You can speak to your Voice Preview Edition, and those commands can be processed completely within the walls of your home. At the time of writing this, there are some pretty big caveats, specifically that you need to speak a <a href="/voice-pe/#language-support">supported language</a> and have pretty powerful hardware to run it (we recommend a Home Assistant system running on an Intel N100 or better).</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/local-cloud.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="graphic of local vs cloud">Diagram of cloud vs local speech processing</p>
<p>If you use low-powered Home Assistant hardware, there is an easy and affordable internet-based solution; <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a>. This privacy-focused service allows you to offload your speech-to-text and text-to-speech processing, all while being very responsive and keeping your energy bill low. Speech-to-text is the harder of the two to run locally, and our cloud processing is almost always more accurate for more languages (visit our <a href="/voice-pe/#language-support">language support checker here</a>).</p>
<p>Our goal is for Assist to run easily, affordably, and fully locally for all languages. As someone who has seen the rapid development of this technology over the past several years, I’m optimistic that this will happen, but until then, many languages have a good range of choices that provide strong privacy.</p>
<h3>Fully open and customizable</h3>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/3d-prints.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Some interesting cartoon-inspired 3D prints for Voice Preview Edition">We are sharing the design files if you want to 3D print a new case... these ones were inevitable</p>
<p>We’re not just launching a new product, <em><strong>we’re open sourcing all of it</strong></em>. We built this for the Home Assistant community. Our community doesn’t want a single voice assistant, they want the one that works for them – they want choice. Creating a voice assistant is hard, and until now, parts of the solution were locked behind expensive licenses and proprietary software. With Voice Preview Edition being open source, we hope to bootstrap an ecosystem of voice assistants.</p>
<p>We tried to make every aspect of Voice Preview Edition customizable, which is actually pretty easy when you’re working hand-in-hand with ESPHome and Home Assistant. It works great with the stock settings, but if you’re so inclined, you can customize the Assist software, ESP32 firmware, and XMOS firmware.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-vpe/grove.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Voice Preview Edition with packaging">Connecting Grove sensors allows you to use your Voice Preview Edition as a more traditional ESPHome device - here is it acting as a voice assistant and air monitor.</p>
<p>We also made the hardware easy to modify, inside and out. For instance, the included speaker is for alerts and voice prompts, but if you want to use it as a media player, connect a speaker to the included 3.5mm headphone jack and control it with software like <a href="https://music-assistant.io/">Music Assistant</a>. The included DAC is very clean and capable of streaming lossless audio. It can also be used as a very capable ESP32 device. On the bottom of the device is a <a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System/">Grove port</a> (concealed under a cover that can be permanently removed), which allows you to connect a large ecosystem of sensors and accessories.</p>
<p>We’ve also made it quite painless to open, with easy-to-access screws and no clips. We even included exposed pads on the circuit board to make modifying it more straightforward. We’re providing all the <a href="https://voice-pe.home-assistant.io/resources/">3D files</a> so you can print your own components… even cartoon character-inspired ones. We’re not here to dictate what you can and can’t do with your device, and we tried our best to stay out of your way.</p>
<h3>Community-driven</h3>
<p>The beauty of Home Assistant and ESPHome is that you are never alone when fixing an issue or adding a feature. We made this device so the community could start working more closely together on voice; we even considered calling it the <em>Community</em> edition. Ultimately, it is the community driving forward voice - either by taking part in its development or supporting its development by buying official hardware or Home Assistant Cloud. So much has already been done for voice, and I can’t wait to see the advancements we make together.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Home Assistant <del>values</del> champions choice. Today, we’re providing one of the best choices for voice hardware. One that is truly private and totally open. I’m so proud of the team for building such a great working and feeling piece of hardware - this is a really big leap for voice hardware. I expect it to be the hardware benchmark for open-voice projects for years to come. I would also like to thank our language leaders who are expanding the reach of this project, our testers of this Preview Edition, and anyone who has joined in our voice work over the past years.</p>
<p>The hardware really is only half the picture, and it’s the software that really brings this all together. Mike Hansen has just written the <a href="/blog/2024/12/19/voice-chapter-8-assist-in-the-home/">Voice Chapter 8 blog</a> to accompany this launch, and this explains all the things we’ve built over the past two years to make Assist work in the home today. He also highlights everything that Voice Preview Edition was built to help accelerate development.</p>

<p>As you have probably already read, we launched our <a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a> today. The culmination of the past several years of open-source software progress on Home Assistant’s home-grown voice assistant, <a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a>. A sizable group of dedicated developers has been working together on adding and honing its many features, and if it’s been a while since you tried Assist, you should use this launch as a chance to jump back in and see the progress we’ve made.</p>
<p><a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a> has been launched to build on this work, continuing the momentum we’ve already built and accelerating our goal of not only matching the capabilities of existing voice assistants but surpassing them. We had an early production run of Voice Preview Edition (a preview preview 😉), and we tried to get them in the hands of as many of our language leaders and voice developers as possible - and we’re already seeing the fruits of their efforts with language support improving over the past month alone!</p>
<p>I’d like to highlight in this voice chapter all the things you can do with Assist today. I also want to give the state of our development, what the limitations are, and where your support can be best applied.</p>

<h2>Assist in the home today</h2>
<h3>Origins of Assist</h3>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-voice-chapter-8/assist.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Early Assist being used in chat">Early versions of Assist via chat - things have come a long way</p>
<p>Voice control for Home Assistant goes back further than most people assume, with some of the groundwork we use today being <a href="/blog/2017/07/29/release-50/">added as far back as 2017</a>. The major turning point came when we refocused our efforts and declared 2023 the <a href="/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/">Year of the Voice</a>. This was an effort to focus development and find areas where our community could make the most impact. During the Year of the Voice <a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a> was added to voice, intents were improved, languages added, wake words were created, and we established great local and cloud options for running voice. Shortly after Year of the Voice many more features were added, including integrated AI, timers, and even better wake words. Year of the Voice got the ball rolling, and Voice Preview Edition will continue its momentum.</p>
<h3>Commands</h3>
<p><a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a> is the underlying technology that allows Home Assistant to turn commands (“turn on the light”) into Actions (<code>light.turn_on</code>). Commands, or as we call them <em>intents</em>, allow you to control pretty much every aspect of your smart home, including on, off, play, pause, next, open, close, and more. We also have intents that give you helpful information like what’s the time, weather, temperature, and so on. Lastly, there are a bunch of other useful miscellaneous things, like adding items to a shopping list and setting timers. If you’re interested, there is a <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/intent_builtin/">full list here</a>.</p>
<h3>Timers</h3>

</div>
<p>When we <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/poll-what-do-you-use-your-voice-assistant-for-what-do-you-expect-it-to-do-multiple-selections/693669">asked our community</a> timers were a top-requested ability. You can not only set a timer, pause, increase, decrease or cancel it, but you can also set commands to <a href="/blog/2024/06/26/voice-chapter-7/#timers-control-devices">trigger after a set amount of time</a>, for example, “turn off the TV in 15 minutes”. You can also just say “Stop” without a wake word, to silence the timer’s alarm. On our Voice Preview Edition, when you set a timer the LED ring counts down the last seconds and flashes when it’s done.</p>
<h3>Exposing devices and Aliases</h3>
<p>This sets us apart from other voice assistants: we allow you to expose and effectively hide devices from your voice assistant. For example, you could choose not to expose a door lock but instead just expose the sensor that knows if the door is closed. It puts you in the driver’s seat on what voice can do in your home. We also introduced aliases to allow you to give devices multiple names, allowing you to speak more naturally with Assist.</p>
<h3>Room context</h3>
<p>If you tell your Assist hardware what room it is in and ensure other devices are organized by room, you can give commands like “turn off the lights”, and without specifying anything, it will turn off the lights in the room you are in. This feature also works with media players (play/pause/next) and timers.</p>
<h3>Wake words</h3>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-voice-chapter-8/wake-word.webp' style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: inline-block;" alt="Timer animation video"><br>Our community is donating small amounts of time to improve wake words <a href="/blog/2024/10/24/wake-word-collective/" target="_blank">with our tool</a>.</br></a>
<p>Wake Words are the unique phrases that initiate a voice assistant to listen and start processing a command. Wake words originally had to be processed on Home Assistant via an add-on like openWakeWord, meaning the Assist hardware needed to continuously stream audio to Home Assistant. Shortly after Year of the Voice <a href="/blog/2024/02/21/voice-chapter-6/#microwakeword">microWakeWord</a> was released, which brought wake word processing on-device for faster responses. It is improving fast thanks to our community using our <a href="/blog/2024/10/24/wake-word-collective/">fast and easy tool</a> to donate samples of their voice. There is a growing list of wake words, and  the on-device options include “Okay Nabu” (default and most reliable), “Hey Jarvis”, and “Hey Mycroft”. Both of these wake word engines were built by the Home Assistant community and are open source, giving the world two great free and open wake word engines!</p>
<h2>Speech Processing</h2>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-voice-chapter-8/voice-pipeline.png' alt="Timer animation video">The Assist pipeline in all its glory</a>
<p>Assist can’t understand spoken words and needs something to take that audio and turn it into text - all this together is called an Assist pipeline. This speech processing is really CPU intensive, so it can’t happen on the Voice Assistant Hardware, and sometimes your Home Assistant system can’t even handle it. One important step we made was adding speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities to <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a>, which allows low-powered Home Assistant hardware to offload speech processing to the cloud. Home Assistant Cloud doesn’t store or use this data to train on - clouds don’t get any more private than ours. It is also the most accurate and power-efficient way to process speech. We’ve put considerable effort into local speech processing, building the add-ons and a new protocol they use to speak to Home Assistant, but they are very reliant on language support from the community.</p>
<h3>Language support</h3>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-12-voice-chapter-8/language-support.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Our language checker">See if your language is supported with <a href="/voice-pe/#language-support" target="_blank">our checker</a>.</p>
<p>Assist aims to support more languages than other voice assistants, and this has been a massive undertaking for our community - We need more help. The first step for language support is getting the commands (intents) right, and we have <a href="https://home-assistant.github.io/intents/">over 25 major languages</a> that are ready to use today. Our wake words are also getting better at understanding different accents thanks to our <a href="https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/">Wake Word Collective tool</a>.</p>
<h3>Text-to-speech</h3>
<p>We built our own text-to-speech system, <a href="/integrations/piper/">Piper</a>, and it now supports over 30 languages. It’s a fast, local neural network-powered text-to-speech system that sounds great and can run on low-powered hardware (it’s optimized for Pi4!). It was built with the voices of our community, and if you don’t see your native tongue, <a href="https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/blob/master/TRAINING.md">add your voice</a>!</p>
<h3>Speech-to-text</h3>
<p>There is one area that holds back the rest of our language support more than others, and that’s local speech-to-text. Building a full speech-to-text model needs big compute resources and terabytes of samples, which is currently outside our reach. We use <a href="/integrations/whisper/">Whisper</a> for local speech-to-text processing, an open-source project from OpenAI, and we’re grateful it exists. For some languages, it works great and doesn’t require a lot of system resources to run well, but for others, you need a pretty beefy system to get acceptable results. In our opinion, only about 15 languages are ready to be run locally on reasonable hardware (an Intel N100 or better) - that’s why before you begin dreaming up your perfect all-local setup, we recommend checking <a href="/voice-pe/#language-support">language support</a>.</p>
<p>We’re always looking for new solutions for low-powered hardware, and are now building another tool that uses much less complex sentence recognition. This could even run on a Raspberry Pi 4, but it would only be able to identify predefined sentences, so if you go off script you may need to call in an AI to help Assist understand your needs. Our language leaders are hard at work putting together the needed translations, but if you want to learn more visit <a href="https://github.com/rhasspy/rhasspy-speech">Rhasspy Speech</a>.</p>
<p>In general, even when your language is supported, you’ll almost always get better results from Home Assistant Cloud. Use the free trial to see what works best for you. Also, you can use both, we know someone using an automation to switch the Assist pipeline to an all local setup when their internet is down.</p>
<h3>AI and Assist</h3>
<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid="vThoxRIxHyI" videotitle="Assist working with AI"></lite-youtube>Our default local conversation agent mixed with AI is great for natural language and speed</p>
<p>Another aspect where we beat the competition hands down is the integration of AI into our voice assistant. You can choose from some of the biggest cloud AI providers like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Claude (paid accounts required). You can also run it locally via <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> if you have a modern graphics processor with enough VRAM, allowing you to build the most capable offline voice setup around.</p>
<p>Our intents (Assist’s built-in sentences) are getting better at understanding most commands, but AI processes commands in natural language, meaning if you get the device’s name ever so slightly off, it can still figure things out. It also provides the ability to ask outside the built-in intents. For instance, if you tell it “It’s a bit cold in here”, it may raise the temperature on your thermostat, but it could forgo any home control and just tell you to put on a jacket - results are not yet consistent. More useful is its ability to take multiple sensors and provide context. For instance, you could ask it for an air quality report, and it could review the CO2 levels and tell you to open a window it observes is shut. All this is experimental, and having an AI control your home is not for everyone, but what’s important is that you have the choice.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So many new innovations and improvements for Assist have happened in the past couple of months, and this speaks to the power of having good hardware to build our software on. Voice Preview Edition is the best open voice hardware available today, and even with it only in the hands of a couple of hundred people today, it’s making a noticeable difference. Whether that’s writing code, improving language support, making blueprints, or even just reporting bugs. The momentum we will build having this in the hands of thousands will be game-changing - it’s why we’ve declared that the era of open voice assistants has arrived.</p>
<p>In the comments sections, we always have a couple of people saying, “but I don’t use voice, what about improving (this or that)”. The good news is that improving Assist and Home Assistant’s other features are already happening in tandem (check out <a href="/blog/2024/11/15/roadmap-2024h2/">our roadmap</a> for the complete picture of our priorities). In the end, only a fraction of our development goes towards voice, and our budget is what Amazon’s voice team probably spends on pizza parties 😆. A great side effect is the problems we’re solving with voice are benefiting other parts of Home Assistant, for example, our integration of AI was driven by voice.</p>
<p>We really think voice is an integral part of a well-rounded smart home ecosystem. It’s especially important for improving the accessibility of home control to all members of the household. There needs to be real options in the space, most importantly ones that give you full control and a real choice on privacy.</p>

    <link href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/12/16/community-survey-2024/"/>
    <updated>2024-12-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/12/16/community-survey-2024</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2024-12-survey/art.jpg' alt="2024 community survey">
<p>As Home Assistant continues to grow and evolve, so does our commitment to making it more inclusive, accessible, and aligned with the diverse needs of our community. To that end, we’re launching an annual survey—and we hope you’ll participate!</p>
<p>A big part of building our <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-introduction/">roadmap</a> going forward was focusing more on research, which led the team to bring me (Annika) in as a Senior User Experience Researcher. We could keep assuming our community’s wants and needs, but we’d rather base our decisions on data-driven insights 😉. With this survey, we aim to better understand not just how you use Home Assistant, but also who you are as a person, a smart home user, and a member of our community. This knowledge will help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tailor our future work to address the needs of our community.</li>
<li>Identify trends and shifts in the smart home landscape over time.</li>
<li>Ensure Home Assistant and its ecosystem reflect the values and priorities of those who use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We understand that some of the questions we’re asking touch on sensitive topics. Rest assured, your responses are completely anonymous, and all questions are optional. If you’re ever uncomfortable, you can skip a question—but for the results to be recorded, you must hit the submit button at the end of the survey. This survey isn’t short; we recommend setting aside around 20 minutes to complete it. <a href="https://home-assistant.typeform.com/communitysurvey#source=blog"><strong>Fill out the survey here</strong></a> or read more about what we’re trying to learn below.</p>
<p>~Annika</p>

<h2>What we’re hoping to learn</h2>
<p>We’re curious about how you began your smart home journey and what drives your decisions today in your home. From the types of devices you use to how your household interacts with your smart home. We want to learn who is using Home Assistant, not just the primary user, but also those living in your smart home. These insights allow us to understand the varied experiences and expertise within the community. For example, knowing your professional background helps us identify areas where your day-to-day knowledge intersects with smart home technologies. We are also asking about neurodiversity, which can help us understand how our community processes and interacts with information. By learning about these differences, we can make our communication and platform design more inclusive. Again, we can understand if you prefer not to share this information.</p>
<p>One area we’re trying to understand better is how you personally resonate with the values of the Open Home. We believe in privacy, sustainability, and choice—but how important are these values to you?</p>
<h2>Your data</h2>
<p>First and foremost, the survey is entirely anonymous, and you can skip any question you don’t want to answer. For sensitive questions (e.g., gender), we provide options like “prefer not to say” or open text fields.</p>
<p>Once collected, the data will be anonymized and aggregated to ensure your privacy. Because we cannot identify individual responses, certain data rights (like deletion requests) won’t be applicable after submission. Please note around halfway through the survey there is a partial submit point, once you click continue the previous answers will be recorded. The data will be stored and handled according to GDPR standards. For more details, see our <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/user-research-agreement/">User Research Agreement</a>.</p>
<h2>How you can help</h2>
<p>This isn’t a short survey and should take around 20 minutes - don’t hesitate to return later to complete it. For the results to be recorded, you must progress past the partial submission point or hit the submit button at the end of the survey. While responding to the survey, be aware that there is no right or wrong answer. It is about you as a person, your experience, opinions, and feelings. Don’t overthink your responses, but stay with the answers that come to your mind intuitively. The more detail, the better - your insights will help shape our future directions. Also, share it with friends, family, or anyone who uses Home Assistant.</p>
<h3>Fill out the Survey <a href="https://home-assistant.typeform.com/communitysurvey#source=blog">here</a></h3>
<p>The survey opens on Monday, December 16, and <strong>closes on Monday, January 20</strong>. Once we’ve analyzed the data, we’ll share the results and insights with the community. By participating, you’re helping us build a better Home Assistant - one that grows with its users and stays true to its values. Thanks for your support!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><lite-youtube videoid="9Y9YY_YHNBY" videotitle="Home Assistant 2024.12 Release Party"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>Home Assistant 2024.12! 🎄</p>
<p>Holidays are coming, and it is time for the last release of the year! 🎉</p>
<p><strong>2024</strong> has been a crazy year for Home Assistant. Not just in terms of features
like <a href="/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/#sections-dashboard-no-longer-experimental">drag-and-drop dashboards</a>, <a href="/blog/2024/04/03/release-20244/#three-new-ways-to-organize">organization capabilities</a> like labels, and
the countless improvements to our voice efforts. But also the founding of
<a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">the Open Home Foundation</a>, and even more in the growth of our lovely community
as we’ve risen up to become <a href="/blog/2024/11/18/event-wrapup-github-universe-24/#we-are-number-1">the #1 open source project on GitHub</a>! ❤️</p>
<p>However, the year ain’t over yet! This month, we want to learn about all your
<em>“What the heck?!”</em> moments with Home Assistant. Tell us about any little
annoyances, bugs, ideas, or suggestions. You can read all about it in
<a href="/blog/2024/11/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck/">the WTH announcement blog</a>, or join the conversation <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/month-of-what-the-heck/61">on our WTH forums</a>!</p>
<p>Honestly, <strong>the biggest announcement of the year has yet to come though</strong>… 🤫
I’m pretty sure it is voice hardware related. 😉 So make sure you aren’t
missing <a href="https://youtube.com/live/ZgoaoTpIhm8">the live stream on 19 December</a>! 📺 You will not be disappointed! 🎁</p>
<p>Before you check out everything in this release, I just want to close this
year with a big thank you to every single person in our community, which
includes you!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for using Home Assistant!</strong> ❤️</p>
<p>Happy holidays! And for the last time in 2024: Enjoy the release!</p>

<h2>Improved scene editor experience</h2>
<p><span class='terminology'>Scenes<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Scenes capture the states you want certain entities to be. For example, a scene can specify that light A should be turned on and light B should be bright red.<a class='terminology-link' href='/integrations/scene/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> are a great way to set the mood in your home. They allow you
to capture the state of your devices at a specific moment and restore it
later, using a button on your dashboard, an automation, or even a voice command.</p>
<p>One of the common frustrations with editing scenes in Home Assistant is that it
would immediately activate and apply the scene if you opened the scene editor.
Not the best experience if you are doing some midnight tinkering and
accidentally activate a scene that turns on all the lights in the house,
waking up everyone. 😅</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/marcinbauer85">@marcinbauer85</a> to the rescue! 🦸‍♂️ As of this release, the scene
editor has two modes. A <strong>review mode</strong> and an <strong>edit mode</strong>.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="The improved scene editor now has a preview mode, which is shown in this screenshot." src="/images/blog/2024-12/scene-review-mode.png"/>
<p>The “review mode” is how your scene will open, and it will show you the scene as
it is currently set up, but it will not apply it. You can then switch to the
“edit mode”; only then will the scene activate, allowing you to adjust the
actual scenery and snapshot it again once you are happy with the changes.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you prefer <span class='terminology'>YAML<span class='terminology-tooltip'>YAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is used to store and transmit data in a structured format. In Home Assistant, YAML is used for configuration, for example in the <code>configuration.yaml</code> or <code>automations.yaml</code> files.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/yaml/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>, you can edit scenes directly from
the scene editor by selecting <strong>“Edit in YAML”</strong> from the three-dotted
<iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:dots-vertical' title='Dots vertical'></iconify-icon> overflow menu in the top right corner.</p>
<h2>Voice</h2>
<p>It has almost been two years since <a href="/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/">we started our journey</a> into building our
very own open source voice assistants, with the goal of letting users control
Home Assistant in their own language.</p>
<p>Today, we are getting even closer to the finish line. Not just with the features
that ship in this release, but you might have heard about our voice hardware
that is coming soon…</p>
<p>With some help from Santa 🎅 and his elves, we have prepared a product launch
YouTube live stream on 19 December 2024, at 20:00 GMT / 12:00 PT / 21:00 CET!</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="ZgoaoTpIhm8" videotitle="Product Launch 🗣️ Voice: Chapter 8"></lite-youtube></p>

channel, and the little bell 🔔 to get notified when we go live! You really
don’t want to miss this one!</p>
<p>But before we get there, let’s dive into the features that ship in this release!</p>
<h3>Let your voice assistant fall back to an LLM-based agent</h3>
<p><a href="/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/">Exactly 6 months ago</a>, we bridged the gap between our default conversation agent
and the wonderful (and scary) world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model">LLMs</a>. We allowed you to experiment and
let an LLM-based conversation agent control your home instead of relying on our
built-in sentences.</p>
<p>This choice was an interesting first step. LLMs are generally much better at
interpreting natural language and more knowledgeable about the world than our
default agent. However, they are often slow and/or expensive. And let’s face it:
Even if the demos are cool, 90% of the commands we say in our homes are simple:
<em>“Turn this on”</em> or <em>“Turn that off”</em>.</p>
<p>Today, we’re finally allowing users to <strong>mix</strong> these worlds. Starting from this
release, you can set up a voice assistant that targets our fast,
community-driven conversation agent first and only falls back to an LLM-based
agent if no matches are found.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Dialog showing the Assist pipeline configuration, showing the new option to prefer handling commands locally." src="/images/blog/2024-12/llm-fallback-configuration.png"/>
<p>This allows you to mix the pros of both worlds with almost none of the cons.</p>
<p>Specific known commands will be processed locally and extremely fast, and the
power of an LLM will only be used for more complex queries that Home Assistant
does not natively understand.</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="vThoxRIxHyI" videotitle="Let your voice assistant fall back to an LLM-based agent" posterquality="maxresdefault"></lite-youtube></p>
<h3>Language leaders are accelerating the pace</h3>
<p>It is no secret: our voice hardware will be revealed on 19 December 2024.
Language leaders have already got their hands on the device, and are working
extremely hard to polish support for their language.</p>
<p>The number of contributions to our <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/intents?tab=readme-ov-file">intents repository</a> (where we store the
supported sentences) skyrocketed during the last month, which we all truly
appreciate. More and more languages are becoming usable or even complete!
You can follow the progress <a href="https://home-assistant.github.io/intents/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We won’t list them all, but rest assured, someone is likely working hard to
ensure your native language works seamlessly, so you can use it comfortably
at home.</p>
<h3>A faster voice experience</h3>
<p>Our default conversation agent was built from the ground up to match a sentence
to its underlying intention extremely fast and on cheap hardware.</p>
<p>Release after release, we added more use cases and sentences to Home Assistant,
and our sentence-matching logic became slower and slower. In some languages,
a non-matching sentence could take more than 15 seconds to process!</p>
<p>This release adds a lot of love to this matching logic; we completely
reengineered the way we match sentences. On top of that, language leaders spent
some time reducing the complexity of their sentences. Some languages saw a 99%
reduction in the number of possible combinations!</p>
<p>The results speak for themselves:</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="RH69Dh6coMM" videotitle="A faster voice experience with our default conversation agent" posterquality="maxresdefault"></lite-youtube></p>
<h2>Revised Integration Quality Scale</h2>
<p>The Integration Quality Scale (IQS) is a way we classify the “quality” of an
integration. It gives users an idea of what to expect from an integration.
You might have noticed our IQS indicator listed on
<a href="/integrations/homewizard">each integration documentation page</a>.</p>
<p>The scale was initially introduced in 2018 and aimed more at the technical
side and code of an integration back then. Over the years, it didn’t
really evolve with the rest of Home Assistant and the general expectations of
our community. It was time for a change!</p>
<p>Over the last few months, we have worked with the community to revise and
improve the scale. Involving not just our community developers but also
documentation writers, user experience designers, and anyone interested
in the community.</p>
<p>As a result, the new Integration Quality Scale is not just focused on the code
but even more on the overall user experience. It is now a more holistic view
of the integration, and we hope it will help everyone make better decisions
about what to use in their homes.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="The integration quality scale is also shown in the Home Assistant UI now. The image shows the HomeWizard Energy integration scoring platinum on the new integration quality scale." src="/images/blog/2024-12/integration-quality-scale.png" />
<p>We now have a total of 4 scaled tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>🥉 <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-bronze">Bronze</a></strong>:
The new minimum set of requirements we’ve set for new integrations.</li>
<li><strong>🥈 <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-silver">Silver</a></strong>:
Ensuring reliability and robustness of integrations.</li>
<li><strong>🥇 <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-gold">Gold</a></strong>:
Ensuring a gold standard user experience, including documentation.</li>
<li><strong>🏆 <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-platinum">Platinum</a></strong>:
The epitome of quality, supreme code quality, and optimal performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have four additional (non-scaled) special tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>❓ <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-no-score">No score</a></strong>:
For integrations that are not yet scored against the new scale.</li>
<li><strong>🏠 <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-internal">Internal</a></strong>
For integrations Home Assistant itself uses, like the automation engine.</li>
<li><strong>💾 <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-legacy">Legacy</a></strong>
For older integrations that can’t be set up through the UI.</li>
<li><strong>📦 <a href="/docs/quality_scale/#-custom">Custom</a></strong>
For custom integrations, as we can’t score those.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read all about these tiers, what they have been designed for, and a
summary of their characteristics on our dedicated
<a href="/docs/quality_scale/">Integration Quality Scale page</a>.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope this new scale will not just help our users, but also our
community developers to understand what is expected by providing a clear path
to improving their integrations. To help with that, we have now
<a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/#integration-quality-scale-rules">extensively documented every rule and requirement for each tier in our
developer documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a> added a download snapshot button to the camera entity information
dialog. Super nice! Thanks!</li>
<li>The UI now displays durations using a timer format (like 03:26:00) in natural
language (3h 26min). Thanks <a href="https://github.com/piitaya">@piitaya</a>!</li>
<li>Support for new units of measurement has been added:
<ul>
<li>Units for area sizes (and conversions between metric and US).
Thanks <a href="htttps://github.com/mikey0000">@mikey0000</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://githubc.com/jschlyter">@jschlyter</a> has added support for MW, GW, TW, GWh, and TWh. Nice!</li>
<li>µV has been added as a unit of electric potential. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/tr4nt0r">@tr4nt0r</a>!</li>
<li>Lastly, mL/s has been added as a unit of volume flow rate. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/zweckj">@zweckj</a>!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you are editing an automation using YAML via our UI and you make a mistake…
you will now actually see the parsing error message in the UI. This is really
helpful! Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Translations for units of measurement</h2>
<p>Over the last few years, we have been working hard to make every little
bit of Home Assistant accessible for everyone by providing translations
for every part of the system. 🌐</p>
<p>However, we still have some edge cases, where we are not able to provide
translations for everything. One of those edge cases is the units of
measurement. 📏</p>
<p>Although units do not need translation (like <code>°C</code> or <code>kWh</code>) in most cases, many
sensors in a home might use specific and non-standardized units. For example,
a sensor that measures the number of “people” in a home or one that tells you
how many “movies” are in your collection.</p>
<p>So, suppose you now have a sensor with a custom measurement unit, like the
amount of “movies” in your collection. In that case, integrations can now
provide translations for those units. 🎉</p>
<p>Several integrations have already added translations for their units, including
<a href="/integrations/jellyfin">Jellyfin</a>, <a href="/integrations/squeezebox">Lyrion Music Server</a>, <a href="/integrations/transmission">Transmission</a>, <a href="/integrations/pi_hole">Pi-hole</a>, <a href="/integrations/qbittorrent">QBitTorrent</a>,
<a href="/integrations/nextdns">NextDNS</a>, <a href="/integrations/mastodon">Mastodon</a>, and <a href="/integrations/mealie">Mealie</a>!</p>
<h2>We’ve upgraded to Python 3.13</h2>
<center><img class="no-shadow" style="width: 65%" alt="The Python logo; Home Assistant now runs on top of Python latest 3.13 update" src="/images/blog/2024-12/python.png"/></center>
<p>This release comes packaged with Python 3.13!  🐍</p>
<p>Wondering what that means? Python is the programming language that powers Home
Assistant behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Why does it matter? Every new Python release brings improvements that we can
tap into—better performance, fewer bugs, and a smoother developer experience
for our contributors. Plus, Python 3.13 offers a speed boost to Home Assistant
overall—what’s not to love? 🚀</p>
<p>Running Home Assistant OS or using the Home Assistant Container? No sweat—we’ve
got you covered. The upgrade to Python 3.13 is handled automatically. Just
update Home Assistant as usual, and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>Easy, right? 😎</p>
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2024.12 in December.
These patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch
release every Friday.</p>

it is inevitable.</p>
<p>We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as

definitively known time-based recorded data.</p>
<p>Prior to this change, if the start of the time window was earlier than the
oldest datapoint in the recorder, <code>history_stats</code> would count time using the
assumption that an entity was in the first state it found since the beginning
of time. This could lead to wild overcalculations when a switch was turned on
after a long period of inactivity, and <code>history_stats</code> would assume it had
<em>always</em> been on and calculate a huge value based on that.</p>

<a href="/blog/2024/11/18/event-wrapup-github-universe-24/#we-are-number-1">the #1 open source project on GitHub</a>!</p>
<p>A lot has happened since <a href="/blog/2022/09/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck/">the last edition two years ago</a>. Lots of effort went
into making a <a href="/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/">voice-controlled Home Assistant</a> a reality. We have implemented
<a href="/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/#sections-dashboard-no-longer-experimental">new dashboards and cards</a> (with drag-and-drop!),
<a href="/blog/2024/04/03/release-20244/#three-new-ways-to-organize">added organization capabilities</a> with labels and categories, and so <a href="/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#dipping-our-toes-in-the-world-of-ai-using-llms">much</a>
<a href="/blog/2023/11/01/release-202311/#there-is-a-lot-to-do">more</a>! But did everything turn out the way it should? Did we miss things?
Or, worse, did something start to annoy you?</p>
<p>That is what this month is about! This year, we are kicking it off in the month
of <strong>December</strong> as a nice closing activity for this year, and we can’t wait to
hear from 👉 <strong>YOU</strong> 👈!</p>

<h3>Lowering the barrier for sharing WTH?! moments</h3>
<p>We realize reporting bugs on our <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/new/choose">GitHub</a> might be a steep hill and, for some,
maybe even a bit scary. You need a GitHub account to report an issue following
issue templates and forms, and the report itself needs to be written in a way
that a developer can work with. Above all, we use our issue tracker to track
actual issues and bugs, not small feature requests or annoyances.</p>
<p>While this is a common and reasonable process to collect, track, and process
bugs, our issue tracking-process might not be the ideal way to learn about your
<em>“What the heck?!”</em> moments, small tweaks, and improvements that can make us
all enjoy Home Assistant even more.</p>
<p>Today, we have opened up a <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/month-of-what-the-heck/61">Community Forum category</a> as a safe, lower-barrier
place to talk about your Home Assistant “What the heck?!” moments.
More importantly: discuss and vote on topics your fellow home automators have
brought up.</p>
<h2>What are we looking for?</h2>
<p>Just as with previous editions, I sent out a related question on my socials
earlier this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🎅 𝘚𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘢 𝘮𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵 𝘣𝘦 𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨… If you could ask for one small Home Assistant
improvement this holiday season, what would it be?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answers to this question pretty much capture the goal behind this month:
Finding those nice quality-of-life features and little annoyances, highlighting
inconsistencies, suggestions for things that could be streamlined more, and even
big-ticket items. All of those things would make Home Assistant even more
awesome for everyone.</p>
<p>I’ve received many responses on these social media posts on <a href="https://x.com/Frenck/status/1861823068735181154">X</a>, <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@frenck/113556074335097996">Mastodon</a>,
and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ofidofdlypuxb2dlfdmbh3a3/post/3lbx2w2kh5a2p">Bluesky</a>. Most of the responses there are <strong>exactly</strong> what we are looking
for this month. I’ve picked a few from these platforms to show you what I mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<em>Makes exposing entities to HomeKit the same as to Alexa &amp; Google</em>” (<a href="https://x.com/peterjvandoorn/status/1861898354038292579">Peter Hardy-vanDoorn</a>)</li>
<li><em>“Polygon zones would be so very helpful instead of just the base circle”</em> (<a href="https://x.com/KrispKiwi/status/1861825026825265406">KrispKiwi</a>)</li>
<li>“<em>Edit a scene without activating it. I can only edit my sleep scene after everyone goes to sleep or in YAML.”</em> (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/codebuild21.bsky.social/post/3lbx72g4l6s2n">codebuild21</a>)</li>
<li><em>“The possibility of catching errors in automations and being able to take actions when they occur 🙂”</em> (<a href="https://x.com/sermayoral/status/1862109088139583917">Sergio Mayoral</a>)</li>
<li><em>“Not Fancy! Better backup management, especially pruning options!”</em> (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aaposutry.bsky.social/post/3lby3xqhzzk2w">Alex Alami</a>)</li>
<li><em>“Persist my prefered dashboard across my different devices/browsers.”</em> (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chayotejarocho.space/post/3lbx7yorfms2c">Carlos Sánchez López</a>)</li>
<li><em>“Home Assistant voice hardware!”</em> (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/paulusschoutsen.nl/post/3lbx32dabes2s">Paulus Schoutsen</a>) 😆</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all great topics for the month of “What the heck?!”, I hope they inspire you for more topics to share 💖.</p>
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>As you might be aware, we also create and publish a bigger, high level, roadmap
for the greater direction of Home Assistant. A few weeks back, <a href="https://github.com/madelena">Madelena</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/jlpouffier">JLo</a> shared the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/11/15/roadmap-2024h2/">2024 Year-end update of our roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>This year’s month of “What the heck?!” is thus different in this regard, as in
previous editions we didn’t have any roadmap in place. For this year’s WTH,
the product team will also be watching for items that will help shape and
prioritize our roadmap for the near future.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, many items on this year’s roadmap that we’ve worked on
have their origins or have been shaped by topics from the previous WTH from
2022. For example, the <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/why-are-all-automations-in-one-big-list/467153?u=frenck">ability to organize automations</a> and the ability to
<a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-cant-we-drag-drop-in-the-dashboard/467205?u=frenck">drag-and-drop cards on your dashboards</a>.</p>
<h2>Why December?</h2>
<p>In the previous editions, we had this month in October; this year, we decided to
move it to December. We figured, the holiday season is perfect for this event. 🎄</p>
<p>Many of us have a bit more time on our hands during the holidays, whether that’s
tinkering with automations, exploring our new dashboards, contributing to our
project, or simply enjoying engaging our active and vibrant community.</p>
<h2>Start sharing your WTH!</h2>
<p>👆That title says it all really. Start sharing <strong>your</strong> “What the heck?!”
moment, browse through all the WTH moments others brought up, and vote for the
ones you feel the same about.</p>
<p>We are excited about this month and looking forward to everything brought up!</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/month-of-what-the-heck/61">Join us on the forums!</a></strong>, or read the <strong><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></strong> below.</p>

So, when does Home Assistant trigger this moment for you?
</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>“Great! I have multiple things! Should I put all my stuff in a single
topic?!”</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>No</strong>, please create <strong>multiple</strong>, <strong>smaller</strong> topics. There is no limitation
on how many forum topics one can create for WTH. Each topic can be voted on,
picked up, and maybe even resolved. Also, having multiple things stacked in
a single forum topic makes resolving, discussing, and voting on them hard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>“Is everything reported going to be fixed/addressed?”</em></strong></p>
<p>Sorry, but the answer here is <strong>no</strong>; there is no guarantee that it will
happen. The goal is to lower the barrier reporting things for one month.
Code contributors will definitely join the effort and address a few of the
listed things. Still, in the end, the number of submissions in WTH is,
in general, simply too much to address. However, we have picked up a lot of
items over the years (including bigger topics); it helps us shape our roadmap.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><a name='no-new-integrations'></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>“I really want this new integration or add-on to be implemented, so I can
use my devices. Is this the right place for it?”</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>No</strong>, this event is <strong>not</strong> for requesting new add-ons or device/services
integrations. Please use the “<a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/feature-requests/13">Feature Requests</a>” forum category instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>“My WTH topic is one of the top-voted ones, so it is going to be
fixed/addressed, right?”</em></strong></p>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a contest. Voting will help with visibility and give a sense
of the suggestion’s impact. However, it might be difficult or too big to
implement. A topic with lots of votes is more likely to be noticed by a
contributor, but it is not guaranteed to be picked up.</p>
<p>Topics with a lot of engagement, of course, help us shape our future roadmap.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>“I’ve found a bug and am comfortable with GitHub. Where should I report my
issue now?”</em></strong></p>
<p>If you are comfortable using GitHub, please, by all means,
<a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/new/choose">file an issue report on GitHub</a> instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>

    <link href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/11/27/home-assistant-yellow-gets-cm5-support/"/>
    <updated>2024-11-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/11/27/home-assistant-yellow-gets-cm5-support</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2024-11-cm5/art.jpg' alt="Home Assistant Yellow in all its glory">
<p>We launched our <a href="/yellow/">Home Assistant Yellow</a> over two years ago, with the design philosophy that it would grow and extend its capabilities with its users’ needs. Need more storage, add an NVMe drive. Need Matter over Thread instead of Zigbee, change the firmware.</p>
<p>Thanks to Raspberry Pi providing us with an early sample, we have been able to add <strong>Compute Module 5 (CM5) compatibility to the Home Assistant Yellow</strong>, which will be included in Home Assistant OS 14 (along with some <a href="#other-additions-to-haos-14">other hardware support</a>). This gives current and future users a great option to get more performance if they need it, but we must say that CM4 is still more than enough for most Home Assistant users’ needs.</p>
<p>As part of the Open Home Foundation, we fight for privacy, choice, and sustainability in the smart home. The Yellow achieves all three, and this announcement only improves the choices available and long-term sustainability.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Using Compute Modules</h2>
<p>When designing Yellow to give our users the ability to expand the capabilities of the device we chose Raspberry Pi’s Compute Module platform. It allows users to increase the RAM, add eMMC, built-in Bluetooth, or even get more speed 😉 - without having to replace the Yellow - all you need to do is get a new module. This is also great for the repairability of the product over its lifetime.</p>
<p>Though it was designed for the Compute Module 4 (CM4), we always hoped it would be compatible with its future successors. Over the past couple of months, we’ve been updating firmware and testing early hardware, and it is indeed compatible. Due to changes on CM5, the installation method is slightly more complex than it was on CM4, which is detailed below.</p>
<h2>What CM5 could bring</h2>
<p>I must admit, it is fun to play with the latest and greatest hardware (while also finding new uses for the hardware it replaces - old Pi products make great <a href="https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-satellite">Wyoming satellites</a>). In most use cases, such as running automations or connecting an average home’s worth of devices, the majority of users will not notice any difference between a Green, CM4, or CM5.</p>
<p>For certain power user needs CM5 might provide big improvements. Some Pi 5 users have seen nearly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaVND-M9pkA&amp;t=415s">3x improvements</a> in ESPHome compilation times; saving a minute or two per device can really add up in big deployments. Another area where CM5 can excel over CM4 is running local speech-to-text processing if you’re using <a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a> fully locally.</p>
<h2>Installing on CM5</h2>
<p>For the Home Assistant Yellow, we have <a href="https://yellow.home-assistant.io/guides/reinstall-os/">two ways to install Home Assistant OS</a> onto the Compute Module. One is very easy and quick (using USB 2.0), while the other is more complex (using rpiboot). Unfortunately, due to firmware differences with CM5 it cannot boot off USB 2.0 devices (though the USB 2.0 ports work once the device is booted).</p>
<p>If you already have a Yellow running Home Assistant OS, upgrading to CM5 can be a drop-in replacement, but in some circumstances it can be more complex,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CM4 Lite (no eMMC) with NVMe storage</strong> - Update to the latest HAOS (version 14.0 or greater - as of writing 14.0 is still pre-release, we recommend you wait for the stable release, but if you want to get the pre-release today either <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/os/#running-a-beta-version">join the beta channel</a> or <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/os/#running-a-specific-version">explicitly install</a> <code>14.0.rc2</code>), power it down, swap the CM4 Lite for a CM5 Lite, and you’re good to go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CM4 with eMMC (regardless if you are using NVMe or not)</strong> -  Download a backup of your Home Assistant, power down your system, and install Home Assistant OS on the CM5 using <a href="https://yellow.home-assistant.io/guides/reinstall-os/#:~:text=Option%202%3A%20Reinstall%20Home%20Assistant%20OS%20using%20rpiboot">rpiboot</a> (the more complex installation method). Once installed restore the backup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New Yellow with CM5</strong>: You will need to install Home Assistant with <a href="https://yellow.home-assistant.io/guides/reinstall-os/#:~:text=Option%202%3A%20Reinstall%20Home%20Assistant%20OS%20using%20rpiboot">rpiboot</a> (the more complex installation method).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For full details on how to set up your Home Assistant Yellow <a href="https://yellow.home-assistant.io/">visit our documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>CM4 is still great</h2>
<p>If you have, or were looking at getting, a Home Assistant <a href="/green/">Green</a> or <a href="/yellow/">Yellow</a> with a CM4, both are more than capable. A third of all Home Assistant users are using Pi 4 class hardware.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-11-cm5/analytics.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="In our analytics Pi 4 class hardware is the most used SBC">
<p>In fact, according to our <a href="https://analytics.home-assistant.io/">opt-in analytics</a>, more people are using Pi 3 hardware than Pi 5 hardware (granted the Pi 5 has only had official support since <a href="/blog/2024/02/26/home-assistant-os-12-support-for-raspberry-pi-5/">February this year</a>). Home Assistant continues to get updates that improve its speed on all hardware, most recently <a href="/blog/2024/02/26/home-assistant-os-12-support-for-raspberry-pi-5/#faster-backups">faster backups</a> and <a href="/blog/2024/03/06/release-20243/#home-assistant-boots-twice-as-fast">reboots</a>. This allows people to keep hardware running longer, and in the end that is our goal 🌎.</p>
<p>CM4 is not only powerful enough for most users, it also has a long life ahead of it. Raspberry Pi has even confirmed that they will <strong>fully support CM4 <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4/?variant=raspberry-pi-cm4001000#:~:text=Obsolescence%20Statement">until 2034</a>💪,</strong> and will continue to manufacture them.</p>
<h2>Other additions to HAOS 14</h2>
<p>On the topic of newly supported hardware, our release of Home Assistant OS 14 will bring support not only for CM5 but also for the Hailo-8 AI accelerator. This is the AI accelerator found in the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/ai-kit.html">Raspberry Pi AI Kit</a> or the even more powerful Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-ai-hat/">released</a> last month, which is exclusively for the Raspberry Pi 5. For those using a Pi 5 they can now offload AI processing, like object or person detection, to this efficient add-on.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We’re incredibly proud that, all this time later, the Home Assistant Yellow continues to be one of the best options for power users. We are excited to see how our users take advantage of CM5, and it’s great to see CM4 continue to be a great option with long-term support.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/art.jpg' alt="Event Wrap-up">
<p>In case you missed it, we had a pretty huge presence at this year’s <a href="https://githubuniverse.com/">GitHub Universe</a>, their global annual developer conference. 2024 was the culmination of many years of our community growing, and there were some really big moments—our community meetup in San Francisco, awards, rising in GitHub’s rankings, and being a part of the event’s Day 2 keynote.</p>
<p>After a few years of being in 2nd place, we are now the #1 open source project on GitHub with over 21,000 contributors helping build Home Assistant. We also won the Wonderfully Welcoming award for being the 2nd most active project for <em>new</em> contributors. This is really just scratching the surface of the week we spent together in San Francisco, and I (<a href="https://github.com/missyquarry">Missy Quarry</a>, your Community &amp; Social Media Manager) would like to share the highlights with everyone who couldn’t make it this year.</p>

<h2>Community comes together</h2>
<p>What started as a simple request to attend the event tumbled into not only being a part of the Day 2 Keynote of GitHub Universe ❗❗ but being offered a venue at GitHub HQ for a community meetup. It picked up from there - interviews, speaking on panels, and after-parties - this 2-day event spun into a 7-day trip to San Francisco. Not only was this my first event as a part of an open source project, but it was also my first time meeting <a href="https://github.com/balloob">Paulus</a> and <a href="https://github.com/frenck">Frenck</a> in person. Paulus is taller than I expected 😅 and Frenck has legs! 😱</p>
<p>While there is a lot of good news for us that came out of GitHub Universe (and I <em>will</em> get to that), I would be a poor community manager if I didn’t start this out with the first in-person meetup I coordinated for Home Assistant. 😌</p>
<p>I knew immediately that I needed custom swag for the event, and got to work with our Graphic Artist, Clelia. We wanted to make sure it was connected to where we were holding the meetup and that it was collectible - we landed on postcards and pins in the shape of stamps.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/postcard-badge.png' alt="postcard and badge">Limited edition San Fran postcard and badge</p>
<p>And, of course, you can’t go to an event without stickers, so we took our Home Assistant and ESPHome logos with an Open Home Foundation badge and made holographic stickers. ✨</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/shiny.png' alt="our shiny stickers" style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'>
<p>The event itself ended up being a small gathering, but it was filled with amazing connections and conversations. Paulus and Frenck talked for over an hour about the status of Home Assistant and what we’re working on right now, then took questions from the community members. It was great talking to everyone who attended - being able to bring people from different aspects of life together energizes me, and I am excited to plan whatever the next meetup will be. 👀</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/meetup-audience.jpg' alt="Universe meetup ahead of the event at GitHub HQ"></p>
<h2>We are number 1!</h2>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/number-1.png' alt="We are number one"></p>
<p>It was an honor just for Home Assistant to be asked to speak at the Day 2 Keynote; what we <em>didn’t</em> know when we started this ride was that the keynote would announce something new: <strong>we are the #1 open source project on GitHub</strong> by active contributors!! 🎉 Not only that, on the rankings for first-time contributors, we moved up to 2nd place, and an Open Home Foundation collaboration partner, <a href="https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/">Zigbee2MQTT</a>, is also now in the top 10! 🥳 This is all featured in the <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/">GitHub Octoverse 2024 report</a>, which is a really interesting read.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/octoverse-contributors.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="top five projects by contributors - source GitHub Octoverse 2024 report">
<p>Our friends at GitHub did a great job of making sure we were surprised by this news—and believe me when I say we lost our collective minds when they revealed it to us. 😎 We also found out that we’ve won GitHub’s <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/celebrating-the-github-awards-2024-recipients/#wonderfully-welcoming-award">Wonderfully Welcoming Award</a>, which recognizes how we attract and support new contributors to our project.</p>

<h2>Open Source - ⭐️ of the show</h2>
<p>Paulus and Frenck were at keynote rehearsals Friday, Sunday, and Monday to be prepared for Wednesday. So I picked up my badge Monday morning, which was a hackable board with an e-ink display programmed to show our names - the little details they put into this event were quite pleasing. 🤩</p>
<p>There was a community session where GitHub showed off a little of what they would reveal on Day 2. At the breakout session, I was able to share our pain points about moderating a community directly on GitHub, and it was good to hear how other projects do this on the platform.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/day-1-keynote.jpg' alt="Paulus, Frenck and myself at the Day 1 keynote">Paulus, Frenck and myself at the Day 1 keynote</p>
<p>Day 1 is when we had our booth in the <a href="https://github.blog/open-source/10-projects-in-the-open-source-zone-at-github-universe-2024/">Open Source Zone</a>, but I was also set to represent Home Assistant at a panel. The session was called <a href="https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe24/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog/session/1715376172449001OEqW">Cha-ching! How to attract funding for your open source projects</a>; I was very excited to tell our story since Home Assistant is funded by y’all - the community - through our <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud subscription</a>, and not investors. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that others on the panel shared our approach to building a sustainable project through community support! I had great conversations with several people working on other open source projects like Homebrew and Ladybird.</p>
<p>Our booth was a great success, and we had so many members of the community come up to us to let us know how much they love Home Assistant, along with some people who had never heard of us curious to learn more. We were surprised to hear that some people had not yet tried the <a href="/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/#sections-dashboard-no-longer-experimental">new Sections dashboard</a>, which we were demoing at the booth. It was really useful to get this feedback in person. All of them took stickers. 😆</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/booth.jpg' alt="Our booth in the Open Source Zone">Our booth in the <a href="https://github.blog/open-source/10-projects-in-the-open-source-zone-at-github-universe-2024/">Open Source Zone</a></p>
<p>Day 2 was when Paulus and Frenck took the stage, and I got there early to ensure I got a good seat up front. We had not only a good crowd in person, but <a href="https://github.com/joostlek">Joost</a> hosted a watch party on the Community Stage in <a href="/join-chat">our Discord server</a>!</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/ha-keynote.jpg' alt="Frenck and Paulus on the keynote stage representing Home Assistant">Their final message to the crowd - <i>what are you going to build?</i></p>
<p>The guys did amazing up on stage! 🤩 It was wonderful to see Paulus explain why Home Assistant was built and how it connects to GitHub’s ambitious goal of 1 billion developers. Frenck shared not only what we’ve done to grow the largest open community on GitHub, but also how the community collectively shapes the project’s direction. <a href="https://github.com/kdaigle">Kyle Daigle</a>, a fellow Home Assistant user and GitHub COO, joined Frenck and Paulus on stage and did a really fun Home Assistant live demo. Paulus also shared how he secured the future of the project by giving it to the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, and its mission to bring privacy, choice, and sustainability to the smart home. Catch their segment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh9A4LvuGHM&amp;t=679s">here</a>, but I would recommend watching the entire keynote - GitHub is doing good stuff for new developers. 😌</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="uh9A4LvuGHM" videoStartAt="679" videotitle="GitHub Universe Day 2 Keynote - featuring Home Assistant"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>After the keynote, Paulus and Frenck both did interviews, and even gave away an extra Home Assistant Green we brought to the guest speaker representing <a href="https://github.com/hackclub">Hack Club</a>. We spent the rest of the day on the show floor, meeting more of the community and enjoying all the fun.</p>
<h2>Connecting with the community</h2>
<p>It was an amazing event, and so nice to meet my colleagues Paulus and Frenck after months of working with them remotely. Most of all, it was great to meet the community, get feedback and hear how Home Assistant improves their lives. Thanks to everyone who took the time to talk to us! 🥰</p>
<p>GitHub was an incredible host, and it was nice to give something back to them after so many years of support they have given this project. At Universe, they gave us a platform to explain how important our community is and how your support has kept Home Assistant thriving and continuously growing - becoming the top open source project on the platform. The next time you see a blog from me should be when I announce Home Assistant Community Day. 😌</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> We are making great progress on our roadmap, and moving forward onto the next priorities on the roadmap. 🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃</p>
<p>As <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-introduction/">we had previously mentioned</a>, the goal of the roadmap is to provide a North Star for all of our product initiatives to follow in a coherent and consistent direction. At the <a href="/blog/2024/04/24/state-of-the-open-home-2024/">State of the Open Home</a> in April this year, we introduced to our community <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/">our first roadmap</a>. We intend to keep our community informed every half year, and this is our first update to our public roadmap.</p>
<p>We are happy to report that we have made good progress on the product initiatives on our roadmap so far, thanks to our core maintainers along with the help of the team at <a href="https://nabucasa.com">Nabu Casa</a>, the commercial partner of the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org">Open Home Foundation</a>. Most of the product initiatives in the 2024 roadmap have matured according to plan, and now the team has begun to focus on the ones that we had planned for next.</p>

<h2>Home Assistant: “A Home-Approved Smart Home”</h2>
<p>The theme of the Home Assistant roadmap is to improve the <a href="https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/open-home-approval-factor/">Home Approval Factor</a> of our platform, ensuring the adoption of Home Assistant by other household members within a smart home.</p>
<p>This can be done by improving the touchpoints that all members of the household will interact with, such as <a href="#automations">automations</a>, <a href="#dashboards">dashboards</a>, and <a href="#voice-assistants">voice assistants</a>, while maintaining the power and depth of the platform for our power users and admins. Our plan is categorized into the following product areas:</p>
<h3>Automations</h3>
<h4>In good shape: Make automations easier to organize</h4>
<p>For a long time, the ability to organize automation was at the top of our feature requests. Therefore, organizing automations was our first focus on the automation product area.</p>
<p>We gave users the ability to categorize automations, which makes the process of managing, editing, debugging, and searching automations much simpler. The categories are up to the users to define. For instance, I personally created categories per functionality such as “Smart Heating” or “Smart Cleaning”, and I particularly like my “Tests” categories where I keep all the automations that are currently being tested in my home.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-04/filter-panel.png" alt="Screenshot of Automations settings with filter panel" /></p>
<p>On top of categories, users can now attach labels to automations, just like any other entity found in Home Assistant. Labels can be used to filter the automation list further, but what I am most interested in is the automation capabilities of the labels themselves. I saw some great ideas in the community, one of them that struck me was the idea to label some automation as “Not Guest Friendly” and deactivate them when a guest mode was activated. It’s nice to see labels as a tool to automate everything, even your automations themselves. 😀</p>
<p>All in all, Home Assistant truly made automations easier to organize in the past 6 months. We could still work on that, no opportunity is ever really done, but for the time being, we are considering this one done so that we can focus on bigger problems.</p>
<h4>Newly in progress: Make automations easier to create</h4>
<p>Automations are one of the cornerstones of Home Assistant, but it’s not an easy task to create them, especially if you are just starting out. There are a dozen things to know before you start and a dozen things to learn along the way.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-01/add-action-search.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new add action dialog utilizing the search function to find whatever you need.">
<p>Last year we redesigned our action picker and replaced a single option with an obscure name, <strong>“Call Service”</strong>, with hundreds of neatly categorized entries that we called <strong>“Actions”</strong>. This improved the automation creation process by quite a margin.</p>
<p>Today, the automation editor feels like it has progressed at two different speeds; our actions are easy to use, but our triggers and conditions are not. So we have begun bringing the same level of convenience that we previously brought to actions to our beloved triggers and conditions.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make our automation editor more approachable without losing what makes us unique: Its capabilities.</p>
<h4>Later priority: Make blueprints easier to use</h4>
<p>Blueprints are amazing, they represent what makes the Home Assistant community truly great: Sharing what you learned with others.</p>
<p>We are aware that using (and sharing) blueprints is not the most straightforward process today. For now, this is the next opportunity we want to tackle inside the automation stream.</p>
<h3>Dashboards</h3>
<h4>In good shape: Make customization of dashboards easy and intuitive</h4>
<p>With the stable release of the new Sections view layout in Home Assistant <a href="/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/">2024.11</a>, our work on making customization of dashboards easier is now in good shape! The learning curve for creating nice dashboards has been vastly reduced, and we are seeing more and more people being interested in and being able to create high-quality dashboards that are usable for everyone in the household.</p>
<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections" src="/images/blog/2024-11/dashboard-conversion.png"/>Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections</p>
<p>Work will continue with the dashboard working group. The group is currently looking into standardizing the appearance of our default cards. <strong>Please <a href="/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/#process-how-can-we-work-together">reach out to us</a> if you are a frontend developer</strong> who would like to contribute and be part of the journey!</p>
<h4>Newly in progress: Make default dashboards more useful and relevant</h4>
<p>Now that we’ve made customization of dashboards easier than ever, what’s next? We understand that it can be intimidating for users when they are faced with a blank slate. Some may be full of ideas on how they would like to fill their dashboards up, but some would prefer if Home Assistant came with something useful out-of-the-box. Therefore, we are now looking into making dashboards easier, even if you don’t know how to create one.</p>
<p class='img'><img alt="Case studies of many dashboards of our users" src="/images/blog/2024-11-roadmap-2024h2/dashboard-casestudies.png"/>Case studies of many dashboards of our users</p>
<p>Over the past year, we have looked into dozens of case studies - dashboards created by many of you, from the most popular to the most pragmatic - and began to notice patterns in how our users organize their dashboards. Home Assistant is unique compared to other smart home platforms in that our dashboards are not just about controlling devices. After all, the perfect app is no app, as in, opening an app to control your light bulb is less convenient than simply flicking a light switch, or better yet, just automating it.</p>
<p>What we see our users have built instead are dashboards that help them keep track of information for their daily lives at a glance, and keep a birds-eye view of everything that is going on around their homes. For example, while you can automate Home Assistant to notify you when energy usage is too high, or you can ask Assist the current power usage, our dashboards shine at data visualization and its ability to tell you lots of information you need by just glancing at it.</p>
<p>Currently, our default dashboard simply dumps every single entity that a home has onto one page, making it wildly unmanageable as the smart home grows. While it can automatically group entities by areas, we have learned that areas are not the only way users look at their dashboard information. What we saw instead are dashboards that are specialized and focused on the functions of a home, such as energy usage, security and safety, and network status, on complex objects, such as a car and a 3D printer, or on information unrelated to the home itself, such as weather, neighborhood information, or even rocket launches. While we can simply show every entity by domain, we know we can make these function-focused dashboards much more useful by exposing insights by curating and juxtaposing information.</p>
<h4>Next priority: Improve privacy in user, guest, and public access</h4>
<p>The inability to fine-tune access to Home Assistant by guests or other members of the family has been a pain point requested by many of our users. We want to investigate ways to mitigate this while improving the privacy of the household. Our research on what privacy means to users will hopefully bring more clarity to this before we start working on it.</p>
<h3>Voice Assistants</h3>
<h4>In good shape: Improve Assist capabilities out of the box</h4>
<p>Assist, our private voice assistant, received a lot of love over the last 6 months. Our first focus was to improve its capabilities out of the box, without needing to tinker with it. We added a lot of features that were heavily requested by the community, features that bring us one step closer to feature parity with our non-private competitors.</p>
<p>We brought area awareness, which allows you to target devices in the same area without mentioning the area (like “Close the curtains” or “Turn off the lights”). We brought floor support, which allows you to target devices across areas on the same floor; very useful for homes with an open floor design (for example “Turn on all lights on the first floor”).</p>
<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid="v3mNdTsX4J0" videotitle="Voice timers with countdown text and loading bar"></lite-youtube>Timers running on an S3 Box, with countdown text and a loading bar!</p>
<p>We implemented timers, allowing any voice assistant device to “ring” when a timer ends, including supporting the creation of multiple timers. You can also pause and resume them and add or remove time from them. You can combine commands with timers by giving a delayed command, allowing you to perform an action after a specific amount of time (like “Turn off the TV in 30 minutes)”.</p>
<p>We also brought the ability to control media via voice. Pausing or resuming them, controlling the volume, and going to the next track. This, combined with the area awareness capability mentioned above made for some really interesting short commands that work in a room with a TV playing or music streaming, such as “Pause”, “Resume” and “Next”.</p>
<p>Finally, our on-device wake word engine called microWakeWord became much faster and much better at recognizing wake words. This is the result of using real voice data in the training process to fine-tune the models. With <a href="https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/">Wake Word Collective</a>, you can now contribute by lending your voice to improve our community-driven, privacy-focused voice assistant! You can read more about it in <a href="/blog/2024/10/24/wake-word-collective/">this blog post</a>.</p>
<h4>In progress: Make Assist easier to start with</h4>
<p>So Assist is more capable, but what about getting started with Voice?</p>
<p>Voice is hard because it is a combination of great software and great hardware. Up until recently, we primarily focused on making the software experience great and relied on readily available hardware to power our voice assistants.</p>
<p class='img'><img alt="A teaser of our voice hardware" src="/images/blog/2024-11-roadmap-2024h2/voice-hardware-teaser.jpg"/>A teaser of our voice hardware</p>
<p>However, this is changing - over the past 6 months, we have built our own hardware! It will be the first voice assistant hardware built from the ground up to work with Home Assistant, fully open source (firmware and hardware), and it is going to be released <em>very soon</em>. It is truly the missing hardware piece to a more approachable voice experience in Home Assistant, and we cannot wait to see what you will build with it.</p>
<h4>Later priority: Make Assist more conversational</h4>
<p>The more functionality we add to Assist, the more we reach its transactional limitations. Indeed, today, an interaction is one way, from a user (issuing a command) to Assist (acting on that command). We would like to improve this, allowing more conversational interactions with Assist.</p>
<p>In the future, Assist will be able to ask for clarifications before fulfilling a command, such as requesting the duration of a timer if it was not part of the original command or asking for confirmation before processing critical actions, such as unlocking all doors. On top of that, we would like to allow the conversation to start from Assist, and not from the user, such as greeting someone when they enter a room.
This pairs very well with LLM-based conversation agents due to their ability to retain context, but we will make sure these types of complex interactions are also possible with our default conversation agent.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<h4>In good shape: Build local LLM infrastructure</h4>
<p>In the past six months, we’ve introduced support for LLM local tools and <a href="/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/#control-home-assistant-using-ai-with-ollama">Ollama</a>, pushing our efforts to make AI more accessible and private for experimentation within Home Assistant. We’ve also dedicated significant effort to creating realistic benchmarks, focusing on natural, conversational use cases rather than edge cases. This approach lets us better understand performance and user experience in day-to-day interactions.</p>
<p>Our latest benchmark for local language models (LLMs) can be explored <a href="https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports">here</a>, showcasing how models like qwen2.5 perform in realistic settings. With these insights, we’re continuing to refine LLM integrations and to ensure that LLMs can be depended upon for common use cases at home.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-06-voice-chapter-7/voice-script.png' alt="Exposing voice scripts to Assist in Home Assistant Voice settings" class='no-shadow'>
<p>You can now expand LLM capabilities by <a href="/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/#expand-an-llm-using-your-scripts">allowing them access to your scripts</a>. This feature lets you precisely control what the LLM does in specific situations, while still benefiting from the flexibility and natural language processing that AIs excel at.</p>
<h4>In progress: Investigate on privacy</h4>
<p>Since our last roadmap update, we have expanded the product and design team working on the Home Assistant project, and we have hired our first ever dedicated user researcher!</p>
<p>While we are ramping up our user research pipeline, we have started working on investigating what privacy means to our users. Of the three Open Home values, privacy, choice, and sustainability, while we have a pretty solid understanding of choice and some understanding of sustainability, the idea of privacy can benefit from more clarity. We have interviewed a handful of users on this topic recently, and we can’t wait to show you what we have found.</p>
<h2>Home Assistant Cloud</h2>
<p>Home Assistant Cloud, powered by our commercial partner Nabu Casa brings, to the many, the hard-to-reach features of Home Assistant usually reserved for power users with expensive hardware at home, with no compromise on privacy.</p>
<p>In recent months, the Nabu Casa team has been hard at work in bringing peace of mind to using Home Assistant. For the cloud backup feature, the Home Assistant team and the Nabu Casa team are now working closely together on a comprehensive revamp of backup integrations, to create an easy one-stop solution to a good backup strategy. We are also working to ensure users have a smooth onboarding for backing up to Home Assistant Cloud, as well as other third-party backup locations.</p>
<p>The team had to postpone some features in favor of others like <a href="/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/#low-latency-cameras-using-webrtc">WebRTC</a>. They had successfully released the infrastructure needed to support WebRTC, both STUN servers for every Home Assistant user and TURN servers for every Home Assistant Cloud subscriber, enhancing real-time communication capabilities within Home Assistant. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is one of the postponed features, but it is still in the Nabu Casa pipeline.</p>
<h2>Open Protocols</h2>
<p>We remain committed to supporting open smart home standards, including Z-Wave Zigbee, Matter, and Thread, aligning with our Open Home mission to offer choice, privacy, and sustainability through locally controlled, cloud-independent devices.</p>
<p>In the past six months, we have made significant steps towards certifications, ensuring our open standards implementations are up to industry standards.</p>
<h3>Z-Wave</h3>
<p>In <a href="/blog/2024/09/24/we-are-joining-the-z-wave-alliance-board/">September</a>, Paulus, the founder of Home Assistant, announced his new role on the Z-Wave Alliance Board of Directors, representing Nabu Casa. Serving on the board will allow Nabu Casa to contribute meaningfully to Z-Wave’s development and ensure that the needs of Home Assistant users and open-source values are represented.</p>
<p>As interest in Z-Wave devices in our ecosystem continues to grow, this has driven Home Assistant to advance the Z-Wave JS stack and create its own Z-Wave hardware. While we are working on the <a href="/blog/2024/05/08/zwave-is-not-dead">certification of our Z-Wave implementation</a>, our work on building our own Z-Wave antenna has also been progressing smoothly. We base the design of our antenna on the <a href="https://github.com/drzwave/ZRAD">Z-Wave Reference Application Design</a> to create a Z-Wave antenna with the best performance in the market.</p>
<h3>Matter</h3>
<p>As one of the first in the industry, in June, we proudly announced that Home Assistant is now based on the <a href="/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#matter-turns-13">latest Matter 1.3 specification</a>. Since then, we continued to update our Matter implementation to improve the reliability and compatibility of Matter devices, and Matter certification should hopefully happen any day now soon!</p>
<p>We have brought expanded device support and performance improvements to Home Assistant’s Matter integration. Air purifiers, room air conditioners, and thermostats are now better supported, along with custom clusters, which allow Home Assistant to detect data changes in real-time, improving network efficiency.</p>
<p>Update entities now provide firmware updates via official Matter update channels, while event entities provide more event types, allowing you to react to single-press or double-press events with ease. Additional features include water valve support, operation state tracking for appliances, and smoke and CO sensor integration. Matter 1.3 power and energy sensors are also supported, providing useful data for the energy dashboard.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we will continue to work on Matter 1.4 compatibility, as well as making device commissioning easier and working with Thread credentials. We have made major strides forward and hopefully we will be able to get through some of our roadblocks soon.</p>
<h3>Zigbee</h3>
<p>The Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA) integration got a massive overhaul <a href="/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/#zigbee-home-automation-zha-updates">during Summer</a>. The whole integration has been split into a separate codebase, making it easier to maintain and improve. This is a huge step forward for the integration, and took months of work to get done. This change will make the integration easier to maintain and improve in the future, including allowing code contributors to contribute more easily.</p>
<h2>What’s next?</h2>
<p>We hope that you can feel the results of all this work.  Given the positive feedback we have received from our users, we will continue to follow our roadmap to work on the next product initiatives.</p>
<p>We will also start preparing for the roadmap for next year. It will have a new theme, and we would like to have our community be more involved in the process of its creation. Planning has already begun, and we hope to announce it at the next State of the Open Home. Last but not the least, please get in the comments and give us your feedback - we read it all!</p>
<p>See you next year!</p>

<h2>Sections dashboard no longer experimental!</h2>
<p>This release marks a big milestone in our pursuit of making dashboards easier to
customize and use for everyone, aka <a href="/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/">Project Grace</a>! The sections view layout,
together with its drag-and-drop 🐲 capabilities and responsive design,
is now <strong>out of its experimental phase</strong>, and ready for primetime! This means
that, as of this release, you will get our awesome feature-rich and easy-to-use
dashboard editing experience when you create a new dashboard. 🎉</p>
<p>Over the past few months, we have worked hard to iterate and listen to your
feedback to ensure that our new dashboard is easy to customize for both
beginners and advanced users alike. We have added new capabilities such as
<a href="/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/">resizing cards</a>, <a href="/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/">visibility options</a>, <a href="/blog/2024/09/04/release-20249/">wider sections</a>, <a href="/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/">new badges</a>,
and, most recently, adding <a href="/blog/2024/10/02/release-202410/">the new heading card</a>.</p>
<p>To finish this journey, we are adding two more features to this release.</p>
<h3>Convert your old dashboards to sections view layout</h3>
<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections" src="/images/blog/2024-11/dashboard-conversion.png"/>Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections</p>
<p>This release includes a way to convert individual dashboard views from the old
masonry view layout to the new sections view layout. When you change the view
type to sections, you get a button to convert the view. All the cards of the
old view are then copied and placed in an imported cards section in the new
view, and you can then easily drag-and-drop them into the right sections.</p>
<p>Please note that cards placed within the imported cards section are only visible
to users once moved to a section above the fold. This ensures that
cards do not get accidentally shown in the wrong sections while you are still
working on the dashboard.</p>
<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the imported cards section" src="/images/blog/2024-11/imported-cards.png"/>Screenshot of the imported cards section</p>
<p>If you are not ready for the new layout yet, no worries! Your old dashboard view
is kept when a new dashboard is created, giving an excellent way for masonry
view veterans to try out sections while keeping all the hard work they have put
into customizing their cards.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can move each card one-by-one from another view. All moved
cards will also be temporarily placed in the imported cards section.</p>
<h3>Precise mode for card sizes</h3>
<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Examples of cards using precise mode" src="/images/blog/2024-11/precise-mode-example.png" style="width: 60%;"/>Examples of cards using precise mode</p>
<p>If you love tinkering with your dashboards and fine-tuning card sizes with more
precision, you now have even more control over the size of cards. In the layout
options of a card you can now enable “Precise mode”, which will give you three
times more options for the card widths!</p>
<p>Precise mode is applied on a card-by-card level. While a normal section is
divided into 4 columns, precise modes gives you 12 columns, which allows you
to align 2, 3, 4, or 6 buttons side-by-side.</p>
<h2>Low latency cameras using WebRTC</h2>
<p>Lots of effort has gone into this new and amazing feature for this release:
<strong>WebRTC</strong>! 🎉</p>
<center><p class='no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Logo of WebRTC" src="/images/blog/2024-11/webrtc-logo-horiz-retro.png" /></p></center>
<p>Not sure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">what WebRTC is</a>? No worries! Let us try to explain. If you are
watching a camera in Home Assistant, you might have noticed it is sometimes
a bit slow and delayed. WebRTC support is going to change that!</p>
<p>Camera streams will now try to use WebRTC whenever possible.
<a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC is a standard</a> that makes a peer-to-peer connection for lower-latency
audio and video streaming. You are probably using this technology a lot already,
for example, when having an online video call. When you’re away from home,
it will try to find the fastest and most direct path between your Home Assistant
instance and the camera you are trying to view.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">The Open Home Foundation</a> will host the negotiating network infrastructure
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN">STUN servers</a>) <strong>for free for all Home Assistant users</strong> and enable the
capability to use WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections whenever possible. If you are using Home Assistant OS or our containers, after you update this will automatically work out of the box.</p>
<center><p class='no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Logo of the Open Home Foundation" src="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/assets/images/logo/open-home-foundation.svg" style="width: 90%" /></p></center>
<p>Sometimes, a direct connection between the client (like your browser
or mobile app) and the camera is not possible; in those situations, the camera
stream needs to be relayed by an external server. <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> now
provides this relay server (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT">TURN server</a>), and it’s <strong>included as one of the many benefits</strong>
available to all subscribers!</p>
<p>So, no matter where you are, you should always be able to watch your cameras
via this low-latency technology. If, for whatever reason, WebRTC is not
available, it will fall back to using the old method of streaming to ensure
you can always see your camera feeds.</p>
<p>So, after reading all of this, what changed? Well, camera feeds will do everything they did before, but will be faster, more responsive, and less delayed! 🎉</p>
<h2>Integrations</h2>
<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>

<p>It is not just new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> that have been added; existing
integrations are also being constantly improved. Here are some of the noteworthy
changes to existing integrations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/joostlek">@joostlek</a> has extended the <a href="/integrations/spotify">Spotify integration</a> with a whole bunch of new
sensors for the current song playing. You can now, for example, automate
putting your house into party mode 🎉 when the song playing is danceable
enough 😎 Awesome job!</li>
<li>The <a href="/integrations/linkplay">LinkPlay integration</a> now has multiroom support! Group and ungroup your
devices to play music in sync or individually straight from Home Assistant.
Thanks <a href="https://github.com/silamon">@silamon</a>!</li>
<li>Staying in the audio department, <a href="https://github.com/mj23000">@mj23000</a> added shuffle and repeat controls
to the <a href="/integrations/bang_olufsen">Bang &amp; Olufsen integration</a>. Nice!</li>
<li>The <a href="/integrations/vicare">ViCare integration</a> now supports room sensors and hot water storage
sensors. Thanks for that <a href="https://github.com/CFenner">@CFenner</a>!</li>

and discovered once instead of separately for each entity; which is much
more efficient. Nice improvement!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Now available to set up from the UI</h3>
<p>While most <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.</p>
<p>The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/local_file">Local file</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/gjohansson-ST">@gjohansson-ST</a></li>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/onkyo">Onkyo</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/Nebula83">@Nebula83</a></li>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/smarty">Smarty</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/joostlek">@joostlek</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Farewell to the following</h3>
<p>The following <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> are also no longer available as
of this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bloomsky</strong>. Their service shut down.</li>
<li><strong>Google Domains</strong>. The domain registration service by Google has been
shut down.</li>
<li><strong>Spider</strong>. The service is no longer available.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/integrations/image">Image entities</a> now have a snapshot action, allowing you to save the current
image in the entity to a file. Nice <a href="https://github.com/NickM-27">@NickM-27</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a> added <a href="/docs/configuration/templating/#limited-templates">(limited) template</a> support to the “at” field of <a href="/docs/automation/trigger/#time-trigger">time triggers</a>.
This allows you to template the time of that trigger in, for example,
a blueprint automation.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_mile">Nautical miles</a> (<code>nmi</code>) is now a valid distance unit. This means you can now
use this as a unit for your distance sensors. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/mib1185">@mib1185</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tetele">@tetele</a> added <a href="/integrations/template/#using-blueprints">blueprints for template entities</a>! This allows for easier
re-use and sharing of common blueprints for sets of templated entities.
This is an advanced feature and is only available using manual YAML
configuration.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/MindFreeze">@MindFreeze</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matthiasdebaat">@matthiasdebaat</a> have improved the network settings user
interface. It is now easier to manage and configure your network settings,
including nicer handling of IP addresses, improved Wi-Fi configuration,
and better visibility on the URLs Home Assistant is using for your instance.</li>
<li>We now indicate if a custom integration is overriding a built-in integration.
This makes it easier to spot if a custom integration is taking over a
built-in integration while you are wondering why you didn’t get the latest
features Home Assistant releases bring. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/MindFreeze">@MindFreeze</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Live logs</h3>
<p>Sometimes, if something does not work as expected, you might resort to a more technical
tool for finding out what is going on: The logs.</p>
<p>Previously, if you looked at the logs of, for example, an add-on or the Home
Assistant Supervisor, you would only see the last 100 log lines. You would
have had to refresh the page to see new log entries.</p>
<p>Well, no more! As of this release, the logs are now <strong>streaming live</strong>! 🎉</p>
<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the imported cards section" src="/images/blog/2024-11/streaming-live-logs.gif"/>Screen recording demonstrating logs showing up as they happen.</p>
<p>And not just that, you can scroll back in time to see previous log items.
That’s a pretty cool improvement. 😎</p>
<h2>Voice</h2>
<p>Last year, 2023, was the <a href="/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/">Year of the Voice</a> for Home Assistant. And while this
year isn’t specifically dedicated to voice, everyone is still working hard
towards the goal of letting users control their homes with their voice in
their own language.</p>
<p>As you might have heard through many community channels 🕵️‍♀️, we are working to
make this a reality for everyone. We are hard at work getting our Home Assistant
voice satellite hardware ready and available for selling and shipping! 🤗</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more information on that soon!</p>
<h3>Home Assistant intents improvements</h3>
<p>One of the things we are working on is the Home Assistant intents. This is a
way for a voice assistant to understand the intention behind your spoken
sentences. This is a very crucial part of a local voice assistant.</p>
<p>In this release, we decided to align and combine Canadian French and French languages for the time being. Though we understand it is a unique dialect, this is about giving Canadian French users a lot more voice features.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-11/canadian-french-on-assist.png" alt="Screenshot showing a few commands in Canadian French before and after this release" /></p>
<p>These intents are built and maintained by the community, and we are very
grateful for their work. For example, <a href="https://github.com/piitaya">@piitaya</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jlpouffier">@jlpouffier</a> have made a
great effort to lead the French language intents mentioned above.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we want to ensure everyone can use Home Assistant in their
own language, <strong>so we need your help</strong>! Help the community by contributing to
the intents for your language. You can find more information on how to do that
in our <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/voice/intent-recognition/contributing">developer documentation</a>.</p>
<h3>Join the Wake Word Collective</h3>
<p>Another essential part of voice is the Wake Word! And this is where <strong>everyone</strong>,
no matter your skill level, can help out with just a minute of your time!</p>
<p>Wake words are the words you say to wake up your voice assistant. For example,
<em>“Hey Google”</em> or <em>“Alexa”</em>. As we are building our own voice assistant with
our own wake words, we need to train our models to recognize these words,
regardless of your accent, language, gender, or age.</p>
<p>So, get your whole home involved 🏠! Take a minute to help us out by recording your voice
saying the wake word. It is super easy, and you can do it right from your
browser or mobile, no need to install anything!</p>
<p><a href="https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/"><strong>Help us improve our wake words today! ❤️</strong></a></p>
<p>You can read more about the Wake Word Collective in our
<a href="/blog/2024/10/24/wake-word-collective/">dedicated blog post</a>.</p>
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2024.11 in November.
These patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch
release every Friday.</p>

<p>Historically, many integrations implemented doorbells as binary sensors with a
device class of occupancy. This design was replaced with the new event entities,
which use a purpose-built device class of doorbell.</p>
<p>HomeKit will no longer automatically link binary sensors with device class
occupancy as linked doorbell sensors. However, linked doorbell sensors can
still be configured manually via YAML.</p>

    <updated>2024-10-24T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/10/24/wake-word-collective</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2024-10-wake-word-collective/art.jpg' alt="Help us improve voice">
<p>Give us a minute of your time and <a href="https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/">lend your voice</a> to improve our community-driven, privacy-focused voice assistant, and together we’ll break big tech’s stranglehold on home voice control.</p>
<p>When you use Home Assistant Assist we’ll never take your data unwillingly to improve its functionality; that’s why we’re asking for your help today (more on that below).</p>
<p>Specifically, we’re trying to improve our wake word engine, which “wakes” the device to listen for more commands. Our open source <a href="https://github.com/kahrendt/microWakeWord">microWakeWord</a> engine is an incredible, lightweight bit of code but requires training with real voices to improve. Everyone’s voice is unique, and we need recordings of people of all genders, ages, and accents from around the world saying this wake word. So get the whole home involved, along with friends and family.</p>
<p><a href="https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/"><strong>Help us today</strong></a></p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Your voice, your choice</h2>
<p>Privacy is at the core of everything we do, and that’s what’s driving us to build an open, local, and private voice assistant. Years ago a voice assistant arms race began between a couple of big tech companies, where they sold very cheap voice hardware, all because they wanted your data. They used that voice data to rapidly improve their voice capabilities (and who knows what else) at <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-47893082">the expense of your privacy</a>.</p>
<p>We will never use those tactics to improve Home Assistant. We do something novel and bewildering to the smart home industry - we explicitly ask for your help. For instance, Home Assistant has <a href="https://analytics.home-assistant.io/">opt-in statistics</a>; these really help us focus on what people are using and put resources into making the biggest impact. When you <a href="/integrations/analytics/">opt-in it really helps</a>, but we totally understand if you don’t - it’s your home and your data. We’re doing the same with voice, explicitly asking for help, and would love your help to improve its wake word capability.</p>
<p>What big tech might consider a weakness is actually our greatest strength - privacy empowers our users, allowing them to not worry about being tracked or classified by an algorithm.</p>
<h2>microWakeWord goes global</h2>
<p>microWakeWord is a very lightweight wake word engine that can run on ESP32-class devices. This allows the voice assistant to listen for a specific phrase, for instance “Okay Nabu”, and ignore all other noise and speech until it hears that. Running it on-device speeds everything up significantly, cutting out the lag from streaming audio continuously to a more powerful device running wake word software. The downside to running it on-device is the amount of training required to get good results.</p>
<p>A few months ago, we promoted an early version of this Wake Word Collective tool in the Open Home Foundation newsletter (<a href="https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/">subscribe if you haven’t already</a>). From that one email alone, we received over 5,800 samples covering 30 different languages. While microWakeWord used to only excel at picking up the English pronunciation of “Okay Nabu”, it’s now many times more effective at picking up different accents. Our testing shows our model trained on this data falsely rejects 5% of samples, while previous models rejected 18%, which shows your samples are making a difference!</p>
<p>We still need more different types of voices from different parts of the world. If you or your family use Assist and find it still struggling to wake up to hear your commands, this is the perfect opportunity to lend your voice to the project.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Before you start recording you will fill in what language you’re most comfortable speaking, allowing us to train language-specific wake word models that are better at detecting subtle differences in pronunciation. You must also read and agree to the <a href="https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/terms.html">Wake Word Collective terms</a>. This explains, among other things, that these recordings will be made available publicly under a Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication. We operate our research openly for the benefit of all, and that is why these will be available to the public.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-10-wake-word-collective/demo.gif' alt="Animation showing how to use the wake word collective tool">
<p>Next, it explains that you only need you to say two words,  “Okay, Nabu”, a couple of times.  You’ll need to set down your phone, tablet, or laptop, and walk around the room, saying the wake word whenever the circle on the screen turns green. Taking samples from all around the room better reflects the real-world use of a voice assistant. Don’t worry about background noise; it’s useful for training.</p>
<p>I said this would only take a minute, but you’ve probably been reading this for longer, so go on and <a href="https://ohf-voice.github.io/wake-word-collective/">get recording</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2024-10-zbt1-issue/art.jpg' alt="Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1 issue and replacement">
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <p class="alert-title"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>
  <p class="alert-content">
<p>The replacement program is now operational, please contact the retailer where you purchased your device to request a replacement. The replacement program only covers ZBT-1 branded devices purchased prior to October 2024, and not SkyConnect-branded devices (identify which device you have <a href="#do-i-have-a-zbt-1">with this graphic</a>).</p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>We’ve found an issue in Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1 that has affected a small number of customers, which appears to be the result of a faulty part incorporated in the first production run of ZBT-1 devices, causing the device to fail and become completely unresponsive. We want to make sure everyone can get a replacement ZBT-1 and ensure they are covered far into the future.</p>
<p>Though Home Assistant SkyConnect is identical to the ZBT-1 under the hood, <strong>it is not affected</strong>. The design is not what’s at fault, but instead, a defective voltage regulator that was used in this specific production run that is causing the issue. When a ZBT-1 is inserted into certain USB-A ports, the voltage regulator can fail, fully bricking the device. We used high-quality manufacturing and quality control in this and previous production runs. We are undertaking an investigation to find out how this could happen and most importantly, to avoid a repeat of anything remotely similar in the future.</p>
<p>We’re sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you. Below are details on our investigation, how devices are affected, and the replacement program.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Around a month ago, we were contacted about one of our latest (and <a href="/blog/2024/06/13/zbt1-annoucement/">recently rebranded</a>) Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1s not being detected and showing a deformation on the housing. A couple more similar issues were reported, and we began a dialogue with the small number of people who were affected, having them send us the devices to test.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-10-zbt1-issue/zbt1-issue.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="ZBT-1 case deformation and faulty voltage regulator">Circled in red the deformation on the case and the board showing the failed chip</p>
<p>Indeed, the device no longer worked at all, not being detected by any device it was connected to. When we opened them, we found a dead voltage regulator. Though SkyConnect devices can also develop a small discoloration on the outside casing after long-term use, and this is not a sign of failure, the deeper deformation in the outer casing pictured above is a sign that the ZBT-1 has overheated and failed. All of our devices are certified by CE and ROHS, and the plastic shell has been designed not to combust. This is a real-life demonstration of just how important this certification is and why we take that step.</p>
<p>We replaced the voltage regulator on the devices we tested, and the devices sprang back to life. We found our culprit, but why was it failing? As mentioned, the SkyConnect internal design and the manufacturing were effectively identical to the ZBT-1, and we received no reports of any such failures in the literally tens of thousands of them in the wild. In manufacturing runs there is always a little variance, and in this run, something went wrong with the voltage regulator that was sourced - again, we’re looking into this.</p>
<p>It took us a couple of weeks to replicate the problem with our own units. We went down some wrong paths, but eventually found it was triggered only by certain devices, specifically certain desktop PCs (internally, we have only found one desktop that causes this failure). We have not observed the failure occur when the device has only been connected to a Home Assistant Green, Raspberry Pi, or even a Mac. If you have plugged your ZBT-1 into a different device, specifically a desktop PC, and it is not recognized by that system, inspect it for this deformation pictured above. Obviously, we want you to be able to use the device with any hardware, and even if only a small number of devices from this production run have reported issues, it is still unacceptable to us.</p>
<h2>Do I have a ZBT-1?</h2>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-10-zbt1-issue/skyconnect-zbt1.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="SkyConnect (left) and ZBT-1 (right)">
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.9rem;">SkyConnect (left) and ZBT-1 (right) branded devices, SkyConnect are unaffected by this issue.</p>
<h2>Pausing sales</h2>
<p>We have asked our distributors to pause sales and return all stock. For the next month, you will see “Out of Stock” banners, and if you are attempting to get a replacement device for a failed unit, this will not be possible until production is resumed.</p>
<p>We are working to have replacement ZBT-1s shipped by early November.</p>
<h2>Replacement Program</h2>
<p>If you have purchased Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1, we are working on a replacement program. This program will see Nabu Casa provide a replacement device free of charge for a period of 60 months (5 years) for verified purchases. Regardless of whether the device has failed, we will provide a replacement upon request.</p>
<p>It is a core value of ours to do things as sustainably as possible, and that’s why we’ve provided such a long coverage period. We want to give owners with working ZBT-1s, who do not expect to use the device in a different system for the foreseeable future, the ability to keep it operating with peace of mind.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <p class="alert-title"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:information-outline'></iconify-icon> Note</p>
  <p class="alert-content">
<p>All ZBT-1 branded devices produced, as of October 2024, are believed to have this fault. You can tell if your device is a ZBT-1 by checking the white label on the back for “ZBT-1” (identify which device you have <a href="#do-i-have-a-zbt-1">with this graphic</a>). There is no need to test if your device is affected by this fault.</p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>If it’s working, keep it plugged into the device it’s working with, and don’t worry about a replacement until you need it. If you need or want a replacement, please contact the seller where you purchased your device, and they will arrange the return process and replacement. Replacement devices are expected by early November, and we will be prioritizing people with non-functioning devices.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We’re sorry for the inconvenience and any disruption to your smart home. As someone who uses Zigbee in their home, which many smart devices rely on, I would hate to have it out of commission.</p>
<p>Worse things can happen, but this has been a gut punch. All our work at Nabu Casa is to fund the development of Home Assistant and support the Open Home. Issues like this eat into our time, and rob our users of new and great things. Ultimately, we’re going to take this setback as a chance to prove we stand by our values and do the right thing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><lite-youtube videoid="_X2-encNyrA" videotitle="Home Assistant 2024.10 Release Party"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>Boo! 👻</p>
<p>Please don’t be scared; it is October, Halloween is coming, and so is the next
Home Assistant release: 2024.10! 🎃</p>
<p>The release we bring you today is a perfect mix of new UI features, advanced
features, improvements, and lots of bug fixes while not being too overwhelming.
There is something for everyone in this release.</p>
<p>Most notably, we have a brand new heading card. It allows you to add titles or
subtitles to your dashboards, make them clickable, and even add cute little
entities to them. The new section dashboard gets better and better with every
release, which is super exciting!</p>
<p>We also introduce some small YAML automation syntax changes. If you are still
a sucker for writing your automations in <span class='terminology'>YAML<span class='terminology-tooltip'>YAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is used to store and transmit data in a structured format. In Home Assistant, YAML is used for configuration, for example in the <code>configuration.yaml</code> or <code>automations.yaml</code> files.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/yaml/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> (like me), I’m sure you’ll love
these little tweaks that make it all feel more natural.</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>

<h2>Heading in the right direction</h2>
<p>Update after update, <a href="/dashboards/sections/">Sections</a> continues to become a customization powerhouse,
and this month is no exception. Section titles are replaced with their own card,
called the <a href="/dashboards/heading/">heading card</a>. Making them a card rather than an inline title gives
you a lot more flexibility, allowing you to put them nearly anywhere.</p>
<p>The heading card can be used to make titles, but also subtitles, which are half
the height and have smaller, lighter text. So, if you have ever had a section
that needs to be subdivided, slap a subtitle in there.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-10/headings.png" alt="Screenshot showing a dashboard using heading cards with titles and subtitles" /></p>
<p>Titles and subtitles can be made clickable, displaying a chevron
<iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:chevron-right' title='Chevron right'></iconify-icon> when you can interact with them. This can
perform an action or navigate to a subpage, like having an energy section title
navigate to the full energy dashboard.</p>
<p>Best of all, if you’ve already added titles to your sections, they will be
migrated automatically to the new card. 😎</p>
<h3>Another headline feature</h3>
<p>We had such a fantastic reaction when we released our <a href="/dashboards/badges/">renewed badges</a>,
and this new heading card has something very similar and equally as visually
appealing. It can show multiple entity states to the right of the title or
subtitle.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-10/heading-with-entities.png" alt="Screenshot showing a dashboard with additional entities shown on card headings" /></p>
<p>Either in a subtle “no color” default or add a splash of color when the entity
is in an active state. Other customization options for these entities include
changing the icon, visibility, and what happens when you select it.</p>
<h2>Repairs for long-term statistics</h2>
<p><a href="https://data.home-assistant.io/docs/statistics/">Long-term statistics</a> are great; they downsample and store the data produced
by your <span class='terminology'>sensors<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Sensors return information about a thing, for instance the level of water in a tank.<a class='terminology-link' href='/integrations/sensor/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>, allowing Home Assistant to store data indefinitely
in a fraction of the space the original readings took up. Take a look back at
<a href="/docs/energy/">your energy usage</a> from two years ago, or see if your living room really is
colder this year compared to last.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-10/statistics-repair.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing a long-term statistic repair showing up in the settings menu" /></p>
<p>In the past, if a statistic encountered an issue, it might be quietly broken
until you dig into the statistics page. Now, Home Assistant will raise a repair
notification when it detects issues with a long-term statistic and give
you options for fixing the issue.</p>
<h2>Improved YAML syntax for automations</h2>
<p>Recently, we renamed <code>service</code> to <code>action</code> in the <a href="/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/#goodbye-service-calls-hello-actions-">Home Assistant UI and YAML</a>.
This was done with the goal of making the syntax more natural, allowing it
to be easier to grasp and read. We want to continue this work to improve the
<span class='terminology'>YAML<span class='terminology-tooltip'>YAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is used to store and transmit data in a structured format. In Home Assistant, YAML is used for configuration, for example in the <code>configuration.yaml</code> or <code>automations.yaml</code> files.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/yaml/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> syntax, this time focusing on <span class='terminology'>automations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Automations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen in and around your home.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/automation/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>, and we’ve made the
following changes,</p>
<ul>
<li>The top-level <code>trigger</code> key is now <code>triggers</code> (plural)</li>
<li>The top-level <code>condition</code> key is now <code>conditions</code> (plural)</li>
<li>The top-level <code>action</code> key is now <code>actions</code> (plural)</li>
<li>The <code>platform</code> key of a trigger definition is now <code>trigger</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The result of all this is that YAML automation syntax now has <code>triggers</code> with
multiple <code>trigger</code> definitions, <code>conditions</code> with multiple <code>condition</code>
definitions, and <code>actions</code> with multiple <code>action</code> definitions.</p>
<p>Here is a small example of an automation highlighting these changes.</p>
<p class="img">
<img src="/images/blog/2024-10/YAML-automation-syntax-changes.png" alt="Screenshots; left showing the old automation YAML style, right showing the new style. The differences between them have been highlighted.">
The 2024.9 release on the left and this 2024.10 release on the right.
</p>
<p>As with the other syntax changes we’ve done recently, this is
<strong>not a breaking change</strong>, and there will be no deprecation. The previous syntax
will continue to work, and there are no plans to remove the old syntax. The new
syntax is recommended, and all documentation and examples have been updated.
Automations managed by the automation editor will automatically be migrated to
the new syntax when saving an automation.</p>
<p>This is not the only change to our syntax, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a> we now support
<a href="/docs/automation/trigger/#merging-lists-of-triggers">merging a list of triggers</a>, which is mostly useful for
<span class='terminology'>blueprint<span class='terminology-tooltip'>A blueprint is a script, automation or template entity configuration with certain parts marked as configurable. This allows users to create multiple scripts, automations or template entities based on the same blueprint, with each having its own configuration-specific settings.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/blueprint/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> authors.</p>
<h2>Faster upgrades when using custom integrations</h2>
<p>We want Home Assistant to continue to work on a wide range of hardware. If you
look at our <a href="https://analytics.home-assistant.io/">opt-in analytics</a> you’ll see a sizable amount of homes running it
on single-board computers from the mid-2010s. A lot of effort has been put into
keeping Home Assistant lean, and this release has some good improvements. This
is specially for users of custom integrations, and this follows HACS getting a
great <a href="/blog/2024/08/21/hacs-the-best-way-to-share-community-made-projects/#faster-downloads">speed boost for downloads</a>.</p>
<p>On each upgrade, all dependencies needed for <span class='terminology'>custom integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>A custom integration is an integration that has been created by someone from the Home Assistant community and has been published for others to use at their own risk. Custom integrations are not supported by the Home Assistant project. They are not reviewed or tested by the Home Assistant development team and thus may negatively impact the stability of your Home Assistant instance. An example of a custom integration is the <a href="https://spook.boo/">Spook</a> integration.</span></span>
are now downloaded and installed. We are now using <code>uv</code> internally to download
and install dependencies, which is a faster and more efficient way to download
and install dependencies. If you’re not aware, <code>uv</code> is what makes our release
process so fast nowadays, and <a href="https://github.com/edenhaus">@edenhaus</a> has done an interesting
<a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/04/03/build-images-with-uv/">developer backstory</a> on our move from <code>pip</code> to <code>uv</code> (saving us 200+ hours
of execution time a month). <a href="https://github.com/edenhaus">@edenhaus</a> has also implemented <code>uv</code> at runtime
as well.</p>
<p>This speeds up the upgrade process, especially for custom integrations with many
dependencies, or installations with many custom integrations. This change is
fully transparent to the user, and no action is required. Just sit down, relax,
and enjoy the faster upgrade process!</p>
<h2>Integrations</h2>
<p>Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>

<p>It is not just new <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> that have been added; existing
integrations are also being constantly improved. Here are some of the noteworthy
changes to existing integrations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Bre77">@Bre77</a> has been busy with the <a href="/integrations/tesla_fleet">Tesla Fleet</a> integration, adding a bunch of
new features and entities to control your Tesla vehicle. It now supports
climate, media player, cover, number, select, button, and lock entities.</li>
<li>You can now control the volume, ringtone, and status light of your <a href="/integrations/reolink">Reolink</a>

</ul>
<h3>Now available to set up from the UI</h3>
<p>While most <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.</p>
<p>The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/emoncms">Emoncms</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/alexandrecuer">@alexandrecuer</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Matter</h2>
<p>At this point, our <a href="/integrations/matter">Matter integration</a> is almost becoming a monthly recurring
topic in our release notes. For a good reason! The development is moving forward
at a strong pace; running toward the certification finish line!</p>
<center><img src='/images/supported_brands/matter.png' alt='Matter logo' class='no-shadow'></center><br>
<p>In terms of stability, we have improved the robustness of the integration to
ensure it sets up correctly every time, even if an issue with one
of your devices occurs. Besides the usual bugfixes and improvements, this
release has some cool new features and additions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Button entities</strong><br />
New button entities that allow you to perform an action on a device. For
example, to identify a device or reset the filter state.</li>
<li><strong>Valve entities</strong><br />
Support for water valves, allowing you to control the flow of fluids or gases.</li>
<li><strong>Support for operation states</strong><br />
Control and monitor the operation state of, for example, dishwashers
and other household equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Support for smoke and CO sensors</strong><br />
Monitor the air quality in your home with smoke and CO sensors.</li>
<li><strong>Add support for Matter 1.3 power/energy sensors</strong><br />
Especially the energy sensors are great to use with the energy dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>In June, we added support for adding <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/07/16/device-info-model-id">Model IDs to devices</a>. This release
has lots of integrations that add them, including <a href="/integrations/matter">Matter</a>, <a href="/integrations/plugwise">Plugwise</a>,
<a href="/integrations/wallbox">Wallbox</a>, and <a href="/integrations/govee_light_local">Govee</a>. We are calling for contributions to add model IDs to
more integrations! Maybe a cool suggestion for an <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> contribution!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bmesuere">@bmesuere</a> improved the accessibility of all graphs by adjusting all the
default colors used in those graphs! You are a hero!</li>
<li>When you unignore an integration or device on the integrations page,
Home Assistant will instantly try to rediscover it again! Nice! Thanks,
<a href="https://github.com/emontnemery">@emontnemery</a>!</li>
<li>We now have a new unit of measurement for energy entities: calories. Useful,
for devices like a treadmill or an exercise bike. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/dudanov">@dudanov</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/TrevorSchirmer">@TrevorSchirmer</a> did something similar, and added a new unit of speed:
mm/s and in/s. Thank you!</li>
<li>When you rename a device, you will now see more details about the rename
operation. Including a preview of the new entity IDs. Nice, <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gjohansson-ST">@gjohansson-ST</a> added a new template function <a href="/docs/configuration/templating/#merge-action-responses"><code>merge_response</code></a> that
allows you to merge multiple responses of a single action or multiple actions
into a single response. Nice!</li>
<li><a href="/integrations/template/#trigger-based-template-binary-sensors-buttons-images-numbers-selects-and-sensors">Trigger-based templates</a> now have support for adding conditions! Just like
automations, you can now add conditions to these entities to control when
they are rendered. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/chammp">@chammp</a>!</li>
<li>More template fun! You can now set up your templated alarm control panel
straight from the UI. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/gjohansson-ST">@gjohansson-ST</a>!</li>
<li>The statistics developer tools have been improved. They now have the new-style
data tables and the ability to bulk select items to action. Awesome <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a>!</li>
<li>There is a new entity in town, the <a href="/integrations/assist_satellite/"><code>assist satellite</code> entity</a>.
It is a building block for remote satellites devices that use <a href="/voice_control">Assist</a>. This
is in preparation for our upcoming satellite hardware. Stay tuned!</li>
</ul>
<h3>The source of a repair</h3>
<p><span class='terminology'>Integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> can raise issues in your repairs dashboard, they can
raise issues for themselves, but also for other integrations. An example of
such an issue is an integration that connects to your device that raises an
issue on an <span class='terminology'>automation<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Automations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen in and around your home.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/automation/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> that controls it.</p>
<p>The result is an automation issue in your repair center. This is cool, but
you might want to know which integration raised the issue in the first place.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/wendevlin">@wendevlin</a>, we now show the source integration of the repair issue
in the issue dialog.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-10/repair-issue-reported-by.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new repairs dialog reporting the integration that raised it.">
<h3>YAML-editor improvements</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/naps62">@naps62</a> has been busy improving the YAML editor found in the Home Assistant
user interface.</p>
<p>We now have a vertical line based on indentation, which makes it easier to see
the indentation of your YAML configuration and allows you to spot and prevent
indentation errors.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-10/YAML-editor-improvements.png" alt="Screenshot showing the YAML editor with collapsed sections and the vertical indentation line.">
<p>But he didn’t stop there. You can now collapse and expand sections of your
YAML configuration based on the indentation level; which is also demonstrated
in the screenshot above.</p>
<p>Nice work <a href="https://github.com/naps62">@naps62</a>!</p>
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2024.10 in October. These
patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch release
every Friday.</p>

<p>To modernize the OpenTherm Gateway integration, all entities have been split
into different devices. As a result, the OpenTherm Gateway climate entity
has been moved to a new OpenTherm Thermostat device.</p>
<p>Configurations that look for the climate entity by device must be adjusted
accordingly.</p>
<p>In the process, all entities were reviewed and some were found to be irrelevant
or superfluous. These entities have been removed. All removed entities were
previously disabled by default, so anyone who has never manually enabled an
entity in the OpenTherm Gateway integration is not affected by this.</p>
<p>All other users should review their configuration for using OpenTherm Gateway
entities that no longer exist or have been assigned to another device.</p>

<p>256KiB is likely to still block Home Assistant’s event loop for an unreasonable

blocks of data, so we want a limit that still allows that but has a reasonable
safety margin to prevent the system from crashing down.</p>
