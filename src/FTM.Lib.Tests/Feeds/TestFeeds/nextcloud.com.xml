<p>Can green IT for sustainable, eco-friendly software solutions exist?</p>



<p>Over the last few years, the energy consumption in IT has seen a significant increase. Data centers expanded with higher demand in connectivity and a surge in data flows as well as AI developments. At the same time, some Big Tech companies are scaling back climate commitments, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/03/06/how-tech-giants-are-powering-their-operations-with-nuclear-and-renewables/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favoring coal-powered or nuclear energy</a> to meet demand.</p>



<p>These trends seem to indicate that scalability and sustainability can not go hand in hand, and that tech growth has got to come at a cost: either performance or climate has to suffer.</p>



<p>At Nextcloud, we have been out on a mission to prove that powerful, sovereign software can also be sustainable. And now, our efforts have been rewarded.</p>



<p>On June 11<sup>th</sup>, Nextcloud became the first cloud software platform to be awarded the Blauer Engel ecolabel. This respected and independent certification marks a product’s resource and energy efficiency.</p>



<p>Awarded by the German Federal Environmental Agency, this certification marks a milestone in sustainable IT, and sets a benchmark for others to follow.</p>



<p>As our CEO and founder Frank Karlitschek puts it, software that reduces energy use and resource consumption also reduces external dependencies and extends the lifespan of existing systems. In other words, designing for efficiency also means designing for control, resilience, and long-term value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Green IT for software: why it matters</h2>



<p>As AI is booming, data centers are becoming one of the fastest-growing sources of energy consumption. A recent study showed that AI already accounts for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/climate-change/676528/ai-data-center-energy-forecast-bitcoin-mining" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">up to a fifth</a> of the electricity that data centers use.</p>



<p>But data centers and their hardware are only part of the story.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, it’s software that determines what resources are used, how often systems need replacing, and how infrastructure can be maintained over time.</p>



<p>While there are frameworks in place for hardware compliance, for example <a href="https://www.onlogic.com/blog/hardware-certification/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to ensure safety and reliability</a>, software has remained largely unregulated. And this while software has a major influence on system-level consumption and hardware lifespan.</p>

<p>That’s where the Blauer Engel (in English: Blue Angel) ecolabel comes in.</p>



<p>The German Environment Agency (UBA) cooperated with the Öko-Institut and Umwelt-Campus Birkenfeld to develop this label that marks the resource and energy-efficiency of software.</p>



<p>Independent auditors carry out the assessments for the software under real-world conditions, using measurable standards and answering questions such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="nc-list">Can the software be operated energy-efficiently?</li>



<li class="nc-list">Can the software manufacturer provide transparency around the consumption?</li>



<li class="nc-list">Does the software comply with sustainability for its technical aspects, like modular design and compatibility with older system?</li>



<li class="nc-list">Can the software manufacturer offer openness of interfaces, data portability, and documentation?</li>
</ul>



<p>These scrutinous questions ensure the label only awards software that reduces hardware churn, saves energy, and supports long-term digital strategies, for <a href="https://nextcloud.com/enterprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Enterprise</a> as well as public institutions.</p>

					<h3>Did you know that? The Blauer Engel ecolabel is no newcomer</h3>
<p>For more than 45 years, the Blauer Engel stands as a compass for consumers and companies, helping them identify truly sustainable products and services. More than 40,000 products and services from more than 1,600 companies have been awarded the Blauer Engel. And Nextcloud has now joined the list as the first ever cloud software platform to receive the renowned label.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nextcloud: Green IT meets digital sovereignty</h2>



<p>At Nextcloud, our mission has always been to put control back in the hands of users, from individuals and universities to public administrations and large enterprises.</p>



<p>Our platform combines real-time collaboration tools, file sharing, communication, and productivity apps, all deployed on infrastructure you control, either privately hosted or in a cloud you trust.</p>



<p>And we do this while staying true to a few key principles:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="nc-list">Open source: Our code is open source, community-driven, and <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/whitepapers/nextcloud-audit-by-swiss-kyos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regularly audited</a>.</li>



<li class="nc-list">Digital sovereignty: You can choose where your company’s data lives and who can access it.</li>



<li class="nc-list">Sustainability: Our values emphasizes resource efficiency, modularity, and longevity.</li>
</ul>



<p>We’ve always believed that these principles go hand in hand. With the Blauer Engel ecolabel, we now have the certification to prove it.</p>

<p>At this year’s Nextcloud Summit in Munich, we announced the recipients of the <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nextcloud Awards 2025</a>. With these awards, we aim a spotlight at individuals and organizations that meaningfully contribute to digital sovereignty – by raising awareness, implementing solutions, or simply setting an example worth following.</p>



<p>The awards were given in two categories: Implementation Role Model and Digital Sovereignty Awareness.</p>



<p>The jury brought together six experts with different backgrounds in technology, policy and research: Max von Thun (Open Markets Institute), Svea Windwehr (Electronic Frontier Foundatin), Aline Blankertz (Rebalance Now), Frank Karlitschek (Nextcloud) and an Editorial team of the Swiss tech policy blog &#8220;Das Netz ist politisch&#8221; (DNIP) represented by Adrienne Fichter, Patrick Seemann and Marcel Waldvogel. Together, we reviewed a broad range of nominations and selected three winners whose work reflects the values and vision behind these awards.</p>



<p>In the category Digital Sovereignty Awareness, the award was given to two organizations that play a crucial role in shaping public understanding and defending core digital rights.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Digital Sovereignty Awareness: Congratulations to CódigoSur and Signal Foundation</h2>



<p><strong>CódigoSur </strong>is a Latin American collective supporting civil society actors with privacy-respecting, open-source infrastructure. Their work strengthens digital rights, independent communication and freedom of expression in several countries across the Global South – often under politically challenging conditions but always comitted to Open Source.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Free Software strengthens our autonomy as users: We are in control of which programs we want to use and when to update them or if we want to sell our data &#8211; decisions that private companies make for us when we use their products. In the same way, the use of Free Software strengthens the technological sovereignty of our communities, since we can reuse and adapt the software, written by other people, to our needs&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>CódigoSur</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The second awardee is the <strong>Signal Foundation.</strong> In a world where messaging platforms are often designed around data extraction and commercial surveillance, Signal offers a strong and credible alternative. The foundation’s work proves that secure, ethical and open communication infrastructure can operate at scale without compromising on its principles. Max von Thun handed over the award to Martin Bartenberger, Head of Communications Europe at Signal.</p>

<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Our mission at Signal is to ensure secure, encrypted communication and to protect freedom of expression. We consistently rely on an open source approach, as it is the only way to provide true security, transparency, and independence. Especially in times like these, we believe this is more important than ever. That’s why we are particularly honored to receive this award and see it as confirmation to continue on this path – together with a growing global community.</p>



<p><strong>Martin Bartenberger</strong>, <em>Head of Communications Europe, Signal</em></p>
</blockquote>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Schleswig-Holstein voted as Implementation Role Model</h2>



<p>In the category <strong>Implementation Role Model,</strong> this year’s award went to the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. The state government has taken consistent and concrete steps towards digital sovereignty, including the migration of its public administration to open-source tools and the establishment of its own infrastructure. The state sets an example of how digital transformation can be aligned with transparency, independence and long-term responsibility.  Sven Thomsen, CIO of Schleswig-Holstein received the award on stage from jury member Patrick Seemann. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full imageRoundShadow"><img decoding="async" width="2560" height="1707" src="https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/06/Nextcloud_Awards4-1-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-316088" srcset="https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/06/Nextcloud_Awards4-1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/06/Nextcloud_Awards4-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/06/Nextcloud_Awards4-1-864x576.jpg 864w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/06/Nextcloud_Awards4-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/06/Nextcloud_Awards4-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/06/Nextcloud_Awards4-1-2048x1366.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When we in Schleswig-Holstein decided to move the state administration toward open source solutions and commit to the path of digital independence, we knew: this journey would be neither short nor easy. But it is necessary — and achievable.</p>



<p><strong>Dirk Schrödter</strong>, <em>Head of the State Chancellery and Minister for Digitalisation of Schleswig-Holstein</em></p>
</blockquote>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The recipients of this year’s awards show in very different ways what digital sovereignty can look like – from practical implementation to global advocacy. Their work stands for a broader movement of people and institutions working to reclaim control over digital infrastructure and shape technology in the public interest. </p>



<p>We thank everyone who submitted nominations and especially the jury members for their thoughtful input and time. And above all: congratulations to the winners.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When the world pivots, keep your communication steady </h2>



<p>Have we lost control over our communication?</p>



<p>The Big Tech clouds keep the entire world’s data in a choke hold, squeezing to increase profit and enabled by proprietary technology. All while nurturing the myth that there’s no alternative. In uncertain times like today, we should not give anybody that much power. It’s no longer optional to keep the tools we depend on the most in our own hands.</p>



<p>Governments and businesses are wondering: how can we make communication resilient to political shifts, price hikes, compliance challenges, and Big Tech monopolies dominating the software market? Three main concerns need to be answered.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are you free from vendor lock-in?</h3>



<p>If Microsoft decides to hike up its prices by tomorrow, it won’t lose its business. When all your data is trapped inside one cloud and made incompatible, switching is increasingly difficult and expensive. And it is so by design.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is your privacy still in check?</h3>



<p>Changes in the US administration may have a direct impact on technology policies and transatlantic privacy laws. With frameworks like <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/eu-us-data-privacy-framework-is-defunct-what-does-this-mean-for-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the EU-US Data Privacy Framework</a> being practically defunct, organizations in Europe and beyond face renewed uncertainty over whether their communications and personal data remain compliant or even protected. Digitally sovereign communication isn’t just a preference anymore, but is quickly becoming a legal and strategic necessity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is your infrastructure really under your control?</h3>



<p>Shutting down access to the Big Tech clouds could cause major disruptions in any of the world’s economies. The existence of this opportunity is itself a threat.</p>



<p>With no other tool providing the convenience of all communication integrated in one suite — team chat, video calls, webinars, and training features — tools like Microsoft Teams have secured dominance on the market. But we can’t keep relying on solutions that take away our control.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Presenting Nextcloud Talk &#8220;Munich&#8221;</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full imageRoundShadow"><img decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-Munich-Feature-Final-highres.png" alt="Nextcloud Talk &quot;Munich&quot; Featured Image" class="wp-image-313735" title="" srcset="https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-Munich-Feature-Final-highres.png 1920w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-Munich-Feature-Final-highres-300x169.png 300w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-Munich-Feature-Final-highres-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-Munich-Feature-Final-highres-768x432.png 768w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-Munich-Feature-Final-highres-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p>Organizations and users need a more reliable, privacy-first collaboration platform, now more than ever. The numbers speak for themselves: the demand for Nextcloud Talk has tripled in the past quarter, compared to the same period last year. Seeing this spike, we asked our users: what needs does Nextcloud Talk satisfy to warrant their choice?</p>



<p>The answers are: resilience, productivity features, and ease of use that provides a low barrier for migration. So, that is where we put our efforts for this release!</p>



<p>Today, we are presenting Nextcloud Talk “Munich”, the innovative, future-proof answer to Microsoft Teams that provides all the tools that a modern hybrid team needs, making them easy to use and integrate into any organization’s workflows.</p>



<p>We enable new telephony features with Nextcloud Talk Phone and introduce a dashboard to speed up your navigation, while your privacy is protected with Secure View support and Sensitive conversations. Navigating your conversations becomes easier with Meeting conversations and other user interface improvments. With new usability and integration features, we made Nextcloud Talk even easier for new users.</p>



<p>With Nextcloud Talk &#8216;Munich&#8217;, get ready for a new generation of online communication — where you’re in control.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-group wide blueGradient white-text borderRadius"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:15% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" src="https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2024/01/nc-enterprise-security-icon-white.svg" alt="Enterprise security" class="wp-image-194024 size-full"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The new standard for resilience</h2>



<p>Communication is the backbone of every work or learning process — for many of us, chats and meetings make up the bulk of the workday. That’s why the resilience of an online communication platform is essential for every team. </p>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<p>You realize the vital nature of those tools when you face downtime or have to move and adapt your entire team to a new collaboration space. Just think of stress factors, like security breaches, performance load, and compliance challenges, that can affect your organization’s flow of information.</p>



<p>With Nextcloud Talk “Munich”, we help you stay in control at all times, ensuring a resilient and independent collaboration space.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list nc-list two-cols">
<li>Host your tools where you want, be it on your own infrastructure or with a cloud provider you trust</li>



<li>Enjoy a fully <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/open-source-vs-proprietary-software-myths-risks-and-what-organizations-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fully open source</a> environment, with access to the entire code, full transparency on how your data is processed, and freedom to make any custom adjustments.</li>



<li>Enjoy decentralized communication between servers with federation (just like how email works!)</li>



<li>Run an air-gapped Nextcloud Talk for your most a sensitive, compliance-focused use cases</li>



<li>Encrypt your data and calls at all times</li>
</ul>



<p>And we added even more tools to enhance your privacy: Secure View and Sensitive conversations.</p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In control of what you share: Secure View</h3>



<p>With Secure View, you can share documents in Nextcloud for viewing with download restriction and a watermark to prevent unauthorized copying. Now you can enable it for all external shares in Nextcloud Talk, so all the external participants in your public conversations view shared documents with privacy restrictions.</p>

<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sensitive conversations stay private on your screen</h3>



<p>Do you need to share your screen without sharing any private communication from your chats? Or are you working in an open, public space, and you need to double down on your privacy settings? Nextcloud Talk now lets you keep your sensitive chats even more private. You can easily hide the last message from your chat list and conceal messengers or message content in notifications.</p>

<li>Video meetings: Run quick voice and video calls with your team and external partners.

In the calls, share your screen, use team chat, send reactions, and more.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Now you know a bit more about the people you work with. In private conversations, along with shared files, tasks, chats, and other items, we added info about your coworkers: their role, location, and local time.

<p>With Nextcloud Talk Phone, the administrator can give unique extensions or phone numbers to each user on the server, so when they receive a call, they can pick up easily in Nextcloud Talk. And when they are out-of-office, the call will be automatically redirected to their replacement!</p>



<p>This requires a SIP service &#8211; Nextcloud supports a range of options. Contact us to help you pick!</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Create temporary conversations for meetings</h4>



<p>You can run a meeting in any existing conversation or create a dedicated meeting room when planning it in your calendar. To help you keep your space clean from conversations you will only use once, we separate &#8220;Meeting conversations&#8221;, created for a single appointment, from the other conversations. Nextcloud Talk “Munich” lets you decide whether you want to keep, archive, or delete the room once the meeting is over. It also stays hidden before the event to avoid clutter and confusion.</p>

<p>Even while away on a vacation or in focus mode, you may want to stay tuned for important messages in case of an emergency. Now you can mark conversations as “important” to receive notifications in “do-not-disturb” mode.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Connected anywhere with mobile and desktop apps</h2>



<p>Nextcloud Talk apps bring team meetings and chats to your device, utilizing the features of your OS to the max while giving you everything the web version does. Take your work communications with you anywhere, share the screen of your mobile phone, and even browse messages online when off the grid. Besides working to make the new features available on your devices, with Nextcloud Talk “Munich” we improved integration of both the mobile and desktop apps into your OS.</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Desktop client: branding, system-level status, and badges</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full imageRoundShadow"><a href="https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-22Munich22-desktop-1.png"><img decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-22Munich22-desktop-1.png" alt="Nextcloud Talk Munich - desktop" class="wp-image-313485" srcset="https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-22Munich22-desktop-1.png 1920w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-22Munich22-desktop-1-300x169.png 300w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-22Munich22-desktop-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-22Munich22-desktop-1-768x432.png 768w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-22Munich22-desktop-1-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a></figure>



<p>What&#8217;s new in the Nextcloud Talk desktop client:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list nc-list">
<li>Branding features. Just like the cloud version, now you can configure the branding of your desktop Nextcloud Talk client. You can already enforce the server URL to be set when people log in, as well as replace logos and icons with your own branding.</li>



<li>System-level status. Now your status adjusts automatically based on whether you are actively using your computer, even when you are not currently in the app. For example, it will show you online as you are working, and switch to “Away” should you lock your screen, even if you didn&#8217;t chat in the Talk app!</li>



<li>Notification badge. Nextcloud Talk icon in the task bar or Dock and system tray or menu bar (depending on the OS) now displays a counter of notifications from chats.</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mobile apps: iOS Shortcuts and easy media sharing</h3>



<p>With the Nextcloud Talk mobile app, you can easily share media like photos and videos in your chats. We improved the sharing interface, adding suggestions of the latest photos for quick sharing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-22Munich22-Quicker-way-to-share-the-latest-images-from-mobile-apps-1.png"><img decoding="async" width="1920" height="1075" src="https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-22Munich22-Quicker-way-to-share-the-latest-images-from-mobile-apps-1.png" alt="Nextcloud Talk Munich Quicker way to share the latest images from mobile apps" class="wp-image-313916" srcset="https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-22Munich22-Quicker-way-to-share-the-latest-images-from-mobile-apps-1.png 1920w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-22Munich22-Quicker-way-to-share-the-latest-images-from-mobile-apps-1-300x168.png 300w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-22Munich22-Quicker-way-to-share-the-latest-images-from-mobile-apps-1-1024x573.png 1024w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-22Munich22-Quicker-way-to-share-the-latest-images-from-mobile-apps-1-768x430.png 768w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/Nextcloud-Talk-22Munich22-Quicker-way-to-share-the-latest-images-from-mobile-apps-1-1536x860.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a></figure>



<p>Using the iOS Shortcuts app, you can automate actions in Nextcloud Talk and use it together with Siri. For example, ask Siri to quickly open an account you want, set status details, or perform something more complex like send a custom message* to a predefined chat. You can also create a Home Screen button for such actions, for example, to open Nextcloud Talk with a personal or work account.</p>



<p><em>*Tip: use &#8220;Ask for Input&#8221; action in Shortcuts for custom messages and other similar commands.</em></p>

<p>You can also configure actions based on your location, time, and other conditions. For example, set a custom status “Working from the office” once you connect to your office WiFi. There’s a lot to play around with — experiment and share your automations with us!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Open source is hot.</p>



<p>All major Silicon Valley players use it as a code base: It runs Google&#8217;s servers, powers Microsoft&#8217;s code, and shapes AI at Meta. But for many, concerns remain, with questions such as: Is open source secure? Can it be trusted for business-critical infrastructure? What happens if we “just replace one dependency with another”?</p>



<p>At Nextcloud, we often hear the same myths around open source. So, let&#8217;s tackle some of them here.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Myth: “Open source is not stable. I don’t want to deal with bugs all day.”</h2>



<p>For some reason, people often think that open source means “amateur-built”, “risky”, or “no clear responsibility.” But these statements could not be further from the truth.</p>



<p>When we talk about the stability of software, it isn&#8217;t a question of open source vs proprietary. It depends on who develops and maintains the project. In purely volunteer-run open source projects, there might be a perception that bugs go unfixed because there is no financial incentive.</p>



<p>However, the reality is often the opposite.</p>



<p>When people contribute to open source in their free time, they take pride in their work. The transparency of open development means your code is visible to anyone, such as your peers and potential employers. Just as you might dress up before going out, developers are motivated to dress up their code, and write clean, functional code. Because after all, it&#8217;s out there for anyone to see. And this of course includes avoiding bugs, and ensuring the stability of the software.</p>



<p>For proprietary software, bug fixing is often driven by business priorities. If resolving an issue doesn&#8217;t directly impact revenue, companies may delay it, or even ignore it completely. Just think of the gaming industry releasing unstable games to the public because of commercial deadlines.</p>



<p>That being said, non-commercial open source projects can sometimes prioritize developer needs over user experience. This may lead to a steeper learning curve, particularly for new users, since ease-of-use or first-time onboarding might not be top priorities for long-term contributors.</p>



<p>But when a company, like Nextcloud, backs an open source project, you get the best of both worlds:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li class="nc-">Development happens in the open, motivating developers to write high-quality, peer reviewed code.</li>



<li>Customer requirements drive usability, stability, and long-term support.</li>
</ol>



<p>The result is open source software that is not only robust and stable, but also ready for real-world needs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Myth: “Open source is not secure. I can’t take that risk for my business.”</h2>



<p>In proprietary code, security is often treated as a cost center. What matters most isn’t whether a product is secure, but whether people believe it is. That&#8217;s why sheer headcount of employees working in security <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/microsoft-makes-security-core-priority-for-all-employees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn&#8217;t mean a safer product</a>. The opposite might even be true: fewer people, working transparently and collaboratively, might deliver better results.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s exactly what the open source approach: transparency above everything. The code is open anyone to inspect, test, and improve. Vulnerabilities don&#8217;t stay hidden as they are found, reported, and fixed in the open. (Remember how we highlighted that developers take pride in their work and will actively contribute to improvements!)</p>



<p>This effect of transparency is clear in the software industry, but also in other areas of society. Communicating openly leads to better science, better governance, and better market pricing. So, security is not the result of money-motivated strategies. A secure, open source system is the outcome of a process powered by visibility, collaboration, and constant peer review.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full imageRoundShadow"><img decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/nextcloud-developer-program.jpg" alt="Nextcloud developer program" class="wp-image-311691" srcset="https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/nextcloud-developer-program.jpg 1920w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/nextcloud-developer-program-300x169.jpg 300w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/nextcloud-developer-program-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/nextcloud-developer-program-768x432.jpg 768w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/nextcloud-developer-program-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p>At Nextcloud, we use this model to track and fix vulnerabilities and send updates to customers. After a safe window for patching, we also publicly disclose any issues in a security advisory. This allows users to verify whether their systems need to be updated and guarantees a secure response to exposures.</p>



<p>On top of that, our open source code can also be analyzed by professional security firms. For example, the city of Geneva contracted Swiss IT security firm Kyos to publicly inspect Nextcloud’s code as part of their due diligence. Anyone can access the findings of this extensive inspection through <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/whitepapers/nextcloud-audit-by-swiss-kyos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a quick and simple download</a>.</p>

					<h3>Did you know that? Nextcloud&#8217;s bug bounty program</h3>
<p>Nextcloud also offers a bug bounty of up to $10,000 to anyone who responsibly reports a vulnerability. This openness attracts independent contributors who help make our platform more protected. Once we’ve fixed the issue, we thank them publicly in our advisories, turning potential risks into shared progress.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Myth: “Open source is not ready for enterprise or business use.”</h2>



<p>You often hear privacy enthusiasts talk about using open source, but it’s far from a niche subject. On the contrary. Many enterprises and big business deploy open source software to develop their systems. To understand its popularity, you just have to look at the numbers.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="nc-list"><a href="https://www.searchlogistics.com/learn/statistics/wordpress-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">More than 40% of websites</a> on the internet have been built with the free and open source software WordPress. Enterprises including Sony, CNN Press Room, Reader’s Digest, NASA, and Times magazine use WordPress to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/40-most-notable-big-name-brands-that-are-using-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">run their blog or websites</a>.</li>



<li class="nc-list">Billions of users run the open source system MySQL, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/mysql/what-is-mysql/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including Facebook, Netflix, and Uber</a>, to manage their data every day.</li>



<li class="nc-list">Over <a href="https://backlinko.com/browser-market-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">140 million users</a> use the open source web browser Mozilla Firefox to surf the web.</li>



<li class="nc-list">Talking about web browsers, the vast majority of code for Google Chrome, as well as Microsoft Edge and Opera, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/what-is-chromium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">runs on the open source code base Chromium</a>. This results, again, in billions of users.</li>
</ul>



<p>But the application of open source goes beyond enterprises. Many governments use open source software as it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption_of_free_and_open-source_software_by_public_institutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gives institutions better control </a>and transparency over data sharing. Notable European examples that adopted open source software for some of their operations include the Austrian capital Vienna, the German city Munich, and the Spanish city Barcelona.</p>



<p>At Nextcloud we provide both <a href="https://nextcloud.com/whitepapers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">private and public customers</a> with enterprise-ready open source software solutions, including Siemens, Amnesty International Spain, Deutsche Telekom, and the French city of Genève. In short, there’s no shortage of users when it comes to open source, proving its readiness for large-scale deployment. Because companies value their offering: transparency, reliability, and security.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Myth: “Open source vs proprietary … Am I not just trading one dependency for another one?”</h2>



<p>“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” right? Some organizations hesitate to move from proprietary systems like Microsoft 365 to open source platforms like Nextcloud because they worry it’s just replacing one dependency with another. “Aren’t we still relying on someone else’s software?”</p>



<p>However, with closed, proprietary ecosystems, you are always at risk of losing access to your data. If they go under, get acquired, change their business model, or simply discontinue a feature you rely on, you are stuck. You always merely rent the software, while they own it. And you always risk someone changing the locks.</p>



<p>With Nextcloud, you get the full source code. Even if by some cosmic fluke the entire Nextcloud company and all its employees were to disappear tomorrow, you&#8217;d still have access to the full source code. That offers real digital sovereignty and complete freedom from vendor lock-in.</p>



<p>Compare that to recent moves by Microsoft, like promising to <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/04/30/european-digital-commitments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deposit source code in a Swiss vault</a>. It sounds reassuring, but in practice, it&#8217;s not that easy. Storing a mountain of undocumented, tightly coupled code, written for a single company’s proprietary stack, won’t make it usable. Rebuilding that environment is close to impossible.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s like trying to resurrect a vintage car with no manual, no parts, and only a few people in Seattle who know how to get it started.</p>



<p>And then we haven&#8217;t even mentioned the difficulty of maintaining and improving that code, or fixing security issues. Every developer knows that for testing, building, and updating, you don&#8217;t only need the code, but the entire toolset. (Which is mostly completely custom and in-house at Microsoft).</p>



<p>Nextcloud, by contrast, runs on nearly half a million servers worldwide. Thousands of contributors have written and reviewed the code. Every day, new users follow our documentation and get their first server online. It’s alive, understood, and actively maintained, not just by us, but by a global ecosystem of sysadmins, developers, and partners.</p>



<p>The result is a sustainable environment that stands for data safety, security, and long-term stability. Even if there is a cosmic fluke tomorrow. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Myth: “With open source, I don’t have control or access to support.”</h2>



<p>When it comes to control, Nextcloud makes sure that you are protected from disruptions to your business. You run it privately on your own servers, either in your own data center or at your existing, trusted supplier. And there is also no need to migrate data. Nextcloud makes your data available to your teams wherever it is: FTP, SharePoint, Windows Network Drive, or an Object Store. Even non-critical data you have on Salesforce, Box, or Amazon S3 is made easily accessible for all users in your organization.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full imageRoundShadow"><img decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/nextcloud-sharepoint-to-cloud-migration.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-311684" srcset="https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/nextcloud-sharepoint-to-cloud-migration.jpg 1920w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/nextcloud-sharepoint-to-cloud-migration-300x169.jpg 300w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/nextcloud-sharepoint-to-cloud-migration-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/nextcloud-sharepoint-to-cloud-migration-768x432.jpg 768w, https://nextcloud.com/c/uploads/2025/05/nextcloud-sharepoint-to-cloud-migration-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p>Together with its simple, familiar interface, introducing Nextcloud becomes a quick and seamless affair. And because Nextcloud is a piece of your infrastructure that is 100% open source, it is 100% yours. You can truly trust it and allow it to manage all this data, hiding the complexity of your infrastructure. You can even regain control over data at Amazon or Google Drive, encrypting data before it gets stored there, so you control who gets access and how.</p>

<p>Because of current privacy concerns, geopolitical tensions, and SaaS vendor unpredictability, organizations need more than just functionality. The debate around open source vs proprietary software is no longer about features and practicalities. It’s about gaining control over your data and ensuring a digitally sovereign future.</p>



<p>By choosing open source for your business software, you assure trust, transparency, and control.</p>



<p>As an open source cloud collaboration platform, Nextcloud combines the power of open source with the stability, support, and enterprise-readiness that businesses and public sector organizations demand. By doing so, we offer a proven, secure, and sustainable alternative to Big Tech, without sacrificing usability or performance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keynote spotlight: Sven Thomsen on digital sovereignty in the public sector</h2>



<p>Following the opening reception, the day will be kicked off by a keynote talk from Sven Thomsen, CIO of Schleswig-Holstein. As a German federal state that has <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/digital-sovereignty-in-action-interview-with-sven-thomsen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successfully transitioned to open source technology</a>, Sven has become a leading voice in how to build a digitally independent Europe.</p>

<p>In his keynote, Sven will share how administrations can make open source an operational reality, from political alignment to data migration strategies. This is a must-attend session for anyone looking to understand how governments can reduce reliance on Big Tech while increasing digital resilience and data protection.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;Europe can do tech&#8221;: expert panel discussion on Europe’s digital future</h2>

<p>The afternoon panel discussion, <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-summit-panel-discussion-on-tech-innovation-europe-can-do-it-strengthening-digital-sovereignty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Europe can do it: strengthening digital sovereignty”</a>, tackles a persistent myth: that Europe can’t compete in tech. Moderated by Cécile Boutelet, Economics correspondent in Germany for Le Monde, the panel promises an engaging discussion between key experts with different backgrounds and perspectives.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list nc-list">
<li class="nc-list">Alexandra Geese, MEP and Digital Services Act negotiator</li>



<li class="nc-list">Max von Thun, Open Markets Institute</li>



<li class="nc-list">Pencho Kuzev, Konrad Adenauer Foundation</li>



<li class="nc-list">Timo Väliharju, COSS Finland and APELL President</li>



<li class="nc-list">Frank Karlitschek, CEO, Nextcloud</li>
</ul>



<p>Together, they’ll examine what it takes to build an independent digital ecosystem in Europe: one that’s open, competitive, and ready for future challenges</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Explore practical insights for your organization: workshops for every role</h2>



<p>Besides the keynotes and main stage sessions, the Summit will host four parallel tracks with workshops tailored to the unique challenges and priorities of the attendees.</p>



<p>Track 1: Open source for enterprises<br>Discover how open source solutions are transforming business operations, boosting workplace productivity, and driving innovation across sectors.</p>



<p>Track 2: Digital sovereignty for public institutions<br>Learn why secure, sovereign digital infrastructures are becoming essential for governments and public organizations, and how to implement them.</p>



<p>Track 3: Technical workshop<br>Get extensive knowledge of the latest tools, deployment strategies, and techniques for building scalable, privacy-focused collaboration environments.</p>



<p>Track 4: Invite-only media roundtable<br>An exclusive session for journalists and analysts on Europe’s shift toward digital sovereignty, and how we can get there.</p>



<p>Attendees can choose which workshops fit their interests best (apart from the media roundtable, which is invite-only) to maximize learning opportunities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exclusive product launch of Nextcloud Talk “Munich”</h2>

<p>The Nextcloud Summit also offers the perfect backdrop for the live launch of Nextcloud Talk “Munich”, the latest version of the video conferencing tool. As <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/your-microsoft-teams-alternative-nextcloud-talk-munich-launching-live-at-the-nextcloud-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a privacy-respecting Microsoft Teams alternative</a>, Nextcloud Talk has become the go-to platform for hosting webinars, meetings, and more for organizations focused on privacy. By freeing users from vendor lock-in, Nextcloud Talk offers hybrid collaboration and privacy-respecting communication, away from Big Tech.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s more: Nextcloud Awards ceremony and post-event networking</h2>



<p>As digital sovereignty is often only discussed in theory, Nextcloud launched <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Nextcloud Awards</a> to recognize those who are turning data freedom into practice. Attendees will get a front-row seat for the first-ever Nextcloud Awards ceremony, the inaugural edition featuring two categories: the Implementation Role Model Award and the Digital Sovereignty in Times of Geopolitical Change Award.</p>



<p>The after-hours networking drinks on the rooftop of the Munich Marriott Hotel City West offer the perfect occasion to exchange thoughts on an idea-packed day and identify next steps for Europe’s digital future. From policy shifts to tech innovation, Europe is at a turning point. Be part of the discussion and shape what’s next for Europe’s digital landscape.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dear users,</p>



<p>Good news. This morning, May 15, Google reached out to us and offered to restore the permission, which will give our users back the functionality that was lost.</p>



<p>We are preparing a test release first (expected tonight) and a final update with all functionality restored. If no issues occur, the update will hopefully be out early next week!</p>



<p>Thanks to your continued support <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f499.png" alt="💙" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Sincerely, the Nextcloud team</p>



<p><em>This update was posted on May 15, 2:50 pm CET (original post below)</em></p>



<p>Dear users,</p>



<p>We are aware that for some months, Nextcloud file uploads for Android users have not been working as expected: you cannot upload all data to your Nextcloud, only photos and videos. We have seen your complaints in various forums such as the Nextcloud <a href="https://help.nextcloud.com/t/unable-to-use-android-upload-due-to-new-google-policy/215499" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">help forum</a>, on <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/14334" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NextCloud/comments/1iaewjm/nextcloud_and_new_google_restrictions/?rdt=64069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Reddit</u></a>, or other <a href="https://www.computerbase.de/forum/threads/google-sabotiert-next-cloud-client-ohne-vorankuendigung.2227335/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forums</a>.</p>



<p>As your experience with the Nextcloud Files app for Android has worsened, we wanted to share the background. Google has revoked a critical permission to sync all files. Despite multiple appeals since mid-2024, Google has refused to reinstate it, forcing us to limit file uploads for millions of users.</p>



<p>The Nextcloud file uploads issue means that some media files, such as pictures and videos, can still be uploaded from Android devices to Nextcloud, but all other files cannot. And that is pretty much beating the purpose.</p>



<p>Google is stating security concerns as a reason for revoking the permission. This is hard to believe for us. Nextcloud has had this feature since its inception in 2016, and we have never heard about any security concerns from Google about it. Moreover, several Big Tech apps as well as Google’s own still have this. What we think: Google owning the platform means they can and are giving themselves preferential treatment.</p>



<p>Despite multiple appeals since mid-2024, Google has refused to reinstate the permission, blocking automated Nextcloud file uploads for millions of users.</p>



<p>To make it crystal clear: All of you as users have a worse Nextcloud Files client because Google wanted that. We understand and share your frustration, but there is nothing we can do.</p>



<p>The more tech-savvy of you are certainly able to use the alternative app store, such as <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nextcloud.client/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">F-Droid</a>. But for our user base of roughly one million users on the app store, this will hardly be an option.</p>



<p>For transparency, we have compiled more background below to help you understand the Nextcloud file upload issue and how Google is abusing its gatekeeper position.</p>



<p>Sincerely, the Nextcloud team</p>

In September 2024, an update of the Nextcloud app for Android was refused out of the blue. We have been asked to remove the permission to all files or use &#8220;a more privacy aware replacement&#8221; like Storage Access Framework (SAF) or MediaStore API.</p>



<p>SAF cannot be used, as it is for sharing/exposing our files to other apps, so the reviewer clearly misunderstood our app workflow. MediaStore API cannot be used as it does not allow access to other files, but only media files.</p>



<p>Despite multiple appeals from our side and sharing additional background, Google is not considering reinstating uploads for all files. Instead of working collaboratively to solve the issue, we only receive the same copy-and-paste answers or links to documentation. With nearly a million users and an 8-year history, it is hard to argue that our Android app has no credibility. So it is very surprising to get treated this way to the disadvantage of our users.</p>



<p>As we needed to release bug fixes to our users and customers, and there was no other way to discuss, we chose to comply with Google’s new regulations. Google finally accepted our newest update, which limits uploads for our users.</p>



<p>The Android app itself still works with the permission, and we released new versions on the external F-Droid store. So the limit is a &#8220;purely&#8221; Google Play Store-related problem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The bigger picture: Big Tech gatekeeping in action</h2>



<p>This might look like a small technical detail, but it is clearly part of a pattern of actions to fight the competition. What we are experiencing is a piece of the script from the Big Tech playbook.</p>



<p>It is a clear example of Big Tech gatekeeping smaller software vendors, making the products of their competitors worse or unable to provide the same services as the giants themselves sell. As they own the platform, they can — and do — give themselves preferential treatment.</p>



<p>A famous example of this in the past was Microsoft, which blocked certain capabilities from Windows to ensure WordPerfect users had a worse experience than people who picked Microsoft Word. Today, Google creates rules in the name of security that make it hard to <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/your-microsoft-teams-alternative-nextcloud-talk-munich-launching-live-at-the-nextcloud-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">build products that compete with them</a>.</p>



<p>We suppose Google can’t get away with this versus Apple or Microsoft, as those companies would retaliate. But smaller companies, especially those building disruptive technologies like ours, are fair game for them.</p>



<p>Big Tech is scared that small players like Nextcloud will disrupt them, like they once disrupted other companies. So they try to shut the door.</p>



<p>Then they have an army of underpaid and overworked people who have to &#8216;handle the complaints&#8217;. Clearly, they have either been directed to simply remove this permission from Nextcloud and ignore any complaints, or they are entirely incompetent. Either way, it results in companies like ours just giving up, reducing functionality just to avoid getting kicked out of their app store.</p>



<p>This isn’t an isolated issue. With the EU’s lack of enforcement on Microsoft’s bundling of Teams and OneDrive into Windows, it seems Google feels emboldened to follow suit, further stifling competition and innovation.</p>



<p>The issue is that small companies — like ours — have pretty much no recourse. Legal actions are too expensive, and a complaint to the EU takes too long. Together with about 40 other businesses and organizations, we filed a complaint about similar anti-competitive behavior in 2021. We are now four years in, and nothing has happened. What do you think happens to a company that releases no updates to its app in four years?</p>



<p>The current oversight processes are absolutely useless against these billion-dollar companies. Even the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fines against Meta and Apple</a> under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in April 2025 were surprisingly low. Remember, fines can be up to 10% of the company’s total worldwide annual revenue. While fines of €200 million or €500 million, respectively, sound a lot, it could have been in the billions. These Big Tech firms earn that much money in a matter of days, so it amounts to barely a slap on the wrist.</p>



<p>And it took a while. The regulation becomes applicable in May 2023 in the EU to make the markets in the digital sector fairer and more contestable. The first fines were announced almost two years later, which is an immense time span in the digital world, and this is just the first step. The firms will put their lawyers to work and appeal — expect this to take another year or two. The EU really has to step up its game if it is serious about reducing the anti-competitive behavior of Big Tech.</p>
