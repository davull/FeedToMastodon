										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, you’ve worked with Visual Studio’s solution file (*.SLN) format, and while it’s a core part of your project organization, we know the experience hasn’t always been smooth. Whether you’ve been modifying, maintaining, or trying to resolve merge conflicts, it’s often felt more like a hassle than it should be. We understand your frustrations, and we’re here to talk about why it’s time for a change and how a new solution file format can make your life easier.</p>
<h2>The Challenges</h2>
<p>Despite being a critical element of the Visual Studio ecosystem, the existing solution file format has its share of drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual Edits Are Tedious: Editing solution files manually is error-prone due to its tool-centric format. Small mistakes often lead to misconfigurations, disrupting your workflow.</li>
<li>Merge Conflicts Are a Constant Issue: In team environments, merge conflicts in solution files can cause lost work, corrupted files, and delays, making it harder to focus on building software.</li>
<li>Verbosity and Redundancy: Solution files start with over 200 characters, and as you add projects, they quickly become bloated with duplicate GUIDs and metadata, cluttering your work.</li>
<li>No Real Benefit from Duplication: Redundant references to project names and solution items provide little value and only add confusion, taking up space without improving your workflow.</li>
<li>Non-Standard File Format: The .SLN file format is specific to Visual Studio and not a widely recognized standard, which limits its compatibility with external tools and automation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>To help you visualize these challenges, here&#8217;s an example of a traditional Visual Studio solution file:</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint language-txt"><code class="language-txt">Microsoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 12.00
# Visual Studio Version 17
VisualStudioVersion = 17.9.34511.98

EndProject
Global

<h2>Simplifying the Solution File</h2>
<p>We’ve made several improvements with the new solution file format to enhance your experience. These changes include a more readable and editable structure, the use of a XML format, and the preservation of whitespace and comments for better organization. The new format is minimalistic, optimizing performance for faster load times, and reduces merge conflicts in version control. It also ensures compatibility with older Visual Studio versions and aligns with certain MSBuild conventions for smoother integration with other tools.</p>
<p>Here’s a detailed look at these enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Human-Readable and Editable:</strong> The new solution file format is designed with clarity in mind, making it easy for developers to read and modify project configurations. This eliminates much of the confusion and errors that arose from manually editing complex files.</li>
<li><strong>Standardized XML Format:</strong> We’ve moved away from a proprietary format and adopted XML for the solution file structure. XML is widely understood, offering flexibility and standardization for greater ease of use.</li>
<li><strong>Whitespace and Comment Preservation:</strong> We now preserve whitespace and comments within solution files when saving them, ensuring your formatting stays intact and helping to maintain an organized file.</li>
<li><strong>Minimalistic Footprint:</strong> The new format adopts sensible defaults, keeping the solution file minimal and optimizing performance. This leads to efficient use of resources, even for large solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Merge Conflicts:</strong> By simplifying the file structure, we&#8217;ve reduced the likelihood of merge conflicts in version control systems. This means fewer headaches when collaborating with teammates and easier management of changes.</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility with Older Visual Studio Versions: </strong>We’ve ensured compatibility with Visual Studio Dev 17.14, allowing a smooth transition between the old and new file formats without disrupting your workflow.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with MSBuild</strong>: The new format aligns with certain MSBuild conventions, which enhances its integration with other tools and platforms, ensuring smoother interoperability.</li>
</ul>
<h3>To give you a glimpse into the simplicity of the new .SLNX format, here&#8217;s an example:</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint language-txt"><code class="language-txt">&lt;Solution&gt;
&lt;Project Path="DotNetMonitorWebApp\DotNetMonitorWebApp.csproj" /&gt;
&lt;/Solution&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To save a solution in the new file format, select the solution node in Solution Explorer, then go to File -&gt; Save Solution As… and choose the &#8220;XML Solution File (*.SLNX)&#8221; format. The solution will then be saved as a .SLNX file.</p>

<p>To open a .SLNX file, use the File -&gt; Open command and select the .SLNX file. Note that Visual Studio is not registered as the default handler for .SLNX files, so they won’t open in Visual Studio by default.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iwc3jGCbt5A?si=Q4fkgrx2lsRT50E8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<p>If you have questions about or are curious to learn more about the format and our plans, have a read of the FAQ section below.</p>
<h3>What is a solution file?</h3>
<p>A Visual Studio solution file (.SLN extension) is essential for organizing and managing multiple projects within Visual Studio. It acts as a container that maintains references between projects, build configurations, and other settings, defining how the solution is structured, and which projects are involved.</p>
<h3>What support is available for the .SLNX format across different tools and environments?</h3>
<p>We are currently working on providing support for the. SLNX format across various tools and environments. Here&#8217;s what you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>MSBuild Support: MSBuild now fully supports the <strong>.SLNX</strong> format, enabling seamless integration with the .NET and C++ build systems. This support allows for efficient building, adding, and removing projects within <strong>.SLNX</strong> files using MSBuild commands.</li>
<li>.NET CLI Support: The <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-slnx-support-dotnet-cli"><strong>.NET CLI</strong> </a>has been updated to handle <strong>.SLNX</strong> files, providing consistent experience for managing solutions directly from the command line.</li>
<li>C# Dev Kit Support: The <strong>C# Dev Kit</strong> for VS Code now fully supports the <strong>.SLNX</strong> format, making it easier to work with solution files within the VS Code environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What about third-party tool support?</h3>
<p>The <strong>.SLNX</strong> file format is designed for <strong>wide adoption</strong>, but we recommend <strong>waiting until it’s more finalized</strong> before fully adopting it.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using tools that rely on either the .SLN or .SLNX file formats, we have
developed an open source serializer that supports both formats: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vs-solutionpersistence">vs-solutionpersistence</a>.</p>
<h3>Can I edit .SLNX files without unloading?</h3>
<p>Like .SLN files, .SLNX files must be unloaded to be edited in Visual Studio. However, we don&#8217;t anticipate many cases where manual editing will be
necessary. If you&#8217;d like to see support for editing without unloading, we
encourage you to upvote the community request.</p>
<h3>What about solution filters?</h3>
<p>Solution filters (.SLNf files), which help improve load and run times, will
continue to work with the new .SLNX format — but keep in mind that filter files are tied to a specific solution file. If you migrate your solution from .SLN to
.SLNX, you’ll need to update the filter file to reference the new .SLNX file, otherwise it will still try to open the old .SLN file.</p>
<h3>Will extensions continue to support. SLNX?</h3>
<p>We designed the .SLNX file format to be transparent to extensions. Existing
Visual Studio APIs that work with .SLN files should continue to work without
requiring changes. However, if your extension directly edits solution files, it will need to support both .SLN and .SLNX formats. To learn more about working with solution files in extensions, we recommend checking out the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vs-solutionpersistence">vs-solutionpersistence</a> library, which provides useful APIs for solution file manipulation</p>
<h3>How do I migrate from the old .SLN format to .SLNX?</h3>
<p>Migrating from the traditional <strong>.SLN</strong> format to the new <strong>.SLNX</strong> format is <strong>simple</strong>, and there are two ways to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Using the .NET CLI (for .NET projects)</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">For .NET developers, you can migrate your solution using the following command:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><code>dotnet SLN &lt;YourSolutionFile.SLN&gt; migrate</code> </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Replace &lt;YourSolutionFile.SLN&gt; with the actual name of your solution file. This command will generate a .SLNX file from your existing .SLN file.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>Using Visual Studio (recommended for all languages)</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Once the <strong>.SLNX</strong> feature is enabled, you can save your solution in the new format directly from Visual Studio — this method works for all supported project types, including <strong>C++, Python, JS/TS</strong>, and others.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">To save in the new format:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>solution node</strong> in <strong>Solution Explorer</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>File -&gt; Save Solution As&#8230;</strong>.</li>
<li>In the file type dropdown, choose <strong>Xml Solution File (*.SLNX)</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Can I have both .SLN and .SLNX files in the same repo? What’s the best practice for teams where some clients still use .SLN and others want to move to .SLNX?</h3>
<p>We strongly recommend <strong>not having both .SLN and .SLNX files in the same repository</strong>. This can cause issues such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commands like dotnet SLN will not automatically detect the correct solution file.</li>
<li>Keeping both files manually in sync can be error-prone and lead to confusion across teams.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you absolutely need to maintain both for compatibility reasons (e.g., during a phased migration), consider using a <strong>sync tool</strong> like this one: <a href="https://github.com/edvilme/dotnet-sln-sync">dotnet-SLN-sync</a>, which helps automatically keep .SLN and .SLNX files aligned.</p>
<p>However, the recommended best practice is to <strong>coordinate the transition with all clients and move fully to .SLNX once the entire team or organization is ready</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>The dotnet-sln-sync tool is a community-developed project and is not maintained or supported by Microsoft. Please use it at your discretion.</em></span></p>
<h3>Will file globbing be supported?</h3>
<p>The current solution design lists all projects and their locations directly in the solution file. This approach allows Visual Studio to begin loading projects almost immediately.</p>
<p>Supporting globbing, would require scanning the file system and evaluating potentially complex patterns to identify matching projects. Especially for larger repositories, this additional step can significantly slow down the loading process which is why globbing is not currently supported.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, globbing refers to pattern matching used to dynamically resolve file paths, commonly seen in many build systems and tools. You can read more about this concept <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)">here.</a></p>
<h3>Why did you choose XML for .SLNX?</h3>
<p>We selected XML because it&#8217;s a widely used format, and it&#8217;s the same format used by project files. XML in project files supports powerful evaluation and execution capabilities, but we want to keep .SLNX simple for now. We’re focused on maintaining the basic functionality like .SLN while keeping things straightforward.</p>
<h3>What are the minimum supported tooling versions for building with &gt;SLNX format, and what scenarios are currently unsupported?</h3>
<p>To build with the <strong>.SLNX </strong>format:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re building with <strong>.NET</strong>, ensure the project’s <strong>global.json</strong> is set to a minimum of <strong>.NET 9.0.200 SDK</strong>.</li>
<li>If you’re building with <strong>MSBuild</strong>, make sure your build tools are using <strong>Visual Studio</strong> or <strong>Build Tools for Visual Studio</strong> version <strong>17.13</strong> or later.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Debugging complex programs often feels like navigating a labyrinth of threads and stack traces. The challenge of understanding thread behaviors and tracing issues can be daunting, leading to longer development times and increased frustration. But now, there&#8217;s a solution that simplifies this process—introducing AI-powered thread summaries in <em>Parallel Stacks Window </em> with Visual Studio.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, Visual Studio introduces two AI-powered features that make debugging more intuitive: <strong>thread summaries</strong> and <strong>app summarization</strong>. These enhancements bring clarity to your debugging workflow by providing concise explanations of thread activity and interactive AI-driven assistance.</p>
<h2>AI-generated thread summaries</h2>
<p>Understanding what each thread is doing at any given moment is crucial when working with parallel execution. The auto summaries feature in <em>Parallel Stacks Window </em>helps developers quickly gain context by generating AI-powered summaries for each thread. Instead of manually analyzing individual stack frames, you can now get a high-level overview at a glance.</p>
<p>When you open the <em>Parallel Stacks Window</em>, these summaries appear at the top of each thread. These summaries provide a high-level overview of each thread&#8217;s current activity, helping you quickly grasp their purpose and status.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1501" height="692" class="wp-image-252658" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/ai-summarization-of-threads.png" alt="AI Summarization of Threads" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/ai-summarization-of-threads.png 1501w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/ai-summarization-of-threads-300x138.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/ai-summarization-of-threads-1024x472.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/ai-summarization-of-threads-768x354.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1501px) 100vw, 1501px" /></p>
<h2>App Summarization with Copilot</h2>
<p>Taking AI assistance a step further, the app summarization feature in <em>Parallel Stacks Window</em> enables developers to interactively explore and resolve debugging challenges with Copilot Chat. This feature doesn’t just summarize— it allows you to ask questions, get explanations, and receive AI-powered suggestions tailored to the debugging context.</p>
<p>Instead of just presenting raw call stacks, this integration provides clear overviews of each thread&#8217;s actions, potential issues, and fixes. This results in a more intuitive approach to multi-threaded debugging, significantly reducing the time needed to understand and resolve complex thread interactions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1238" height="833" class="wp-image-252659" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/copilot-chat-integration-in-parallel-stack-deadloc-1.png" alt="Copilot Chat Integration In Parallel Stack Deadlock example " srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/copilot-chat-integration-in-parallel-stack-deadloc-1.png 1238w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/copilot-chat-integration-in-parallel-stack-deadloc-1-300x202.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/copilot-chat-integration-in-parallel-stack-deadloc-1-1024x689.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/copilot-chat-integration-in-parallel-stack-deadloc-1-768x517.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1238px) 100vw, 1238px" /></p>
<p>To use this feature, simply click the “summarize” button at the top of the <em>Parallel Stacks Window</em>. This will open the Copilot Chat on the side, preloaded with relevant thread context. You can then engage in an interactive, AI-powered conversation to resolve common threading issues such as deadlocks and race conditions while optimizing your threading model for better efficiency and reliability.Bottom of Form</p>
<p>By seamlessly combining parallel stack insights with Copilot Chat&#8217;s app summaries, Visual Studio streamlines your debugging workflow, empowering you to diagnose, understand, and address threading issues with greater confidence and speed.</p>
<h2>Try It Out</h2>
<p>Both AI-generated<strong> thread summaries</strong> and <strong>app summarization </strong>aim to reduce debugging time and improve developer productivity. Whether you need a high-level overview or an in-depth analysis of a thread, these features provide the clarity and intelligence required to navigate complex debugging scenarios.</p>
<p>Please try it out and give us some <a href="https://developercommunity.microsoft.com/VisualStudio">feedback</a>. Your insights and suggestions are invaluable as we strive to make Visual Studio the best development environment for you.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping us make Visual Studio better every day.</p>

<h2>What is Cloud Academy?</h2>
<p>Cloud Academy, now part of QA, is a premier learning platform that helps developers and IT pros master cloud technologies. QA acquired Cloud Academy to expand its robust training offerings, bringing even more hands-on, outcome-based learning experiences to users worldwide.</p>
<h2>Master Azure with Hands-on Learning</h2>
<p>I know how important hands-on experience is when it comes to mastering cloud skills, and this benefit is packed with practical learning opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>221 Hands-on Labs</strong></li>
<li><strong>330 Lessons</strong></li>
<li><strong>111 Exams</strong></li>
<li><strong>23 Certification Exam Prep Courses</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Learn Your Way</h2>
<p>One of my favorite features of this platform is how flexible the learning options are. You can choose the style that fits you best:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Smarter Learning with AI-Powered Smart Assessments &amp; Ela: Your Expert Learning Assistant</h2>
<p>Another standout feature is Ela, your Expert Learning Assistant, and Smart Assessments—and I think you’re going to love it. Instead of working through lessons you’ve already mastered, these AI-driven assessments baseline your knowledge and adjust your learning path accordingly. That means less time reviewing what you already know and more time building new skills that matter.</p>
<h2>Meet Ela: Your AI-Powered Learning Assistant</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited about this—Cloud Academy now includes Ela, an AI-driven learning assistant designed to enhance your self-paced learning experience. Ela is trained exclusively on QA-authored content, making it a trusted source for guidance whenever you need it.</p>
<p>What makes Ela special? Unlike basic AI chatbots, Ela is built with real-world expertise to provide tutor-style support. Whether you&#8217;re looking for quick revision, knowledge checks, explanations of complex topics, or even lab-specific assistance, Ela is available 24/7 to help you along the way.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of Ela&#8217;s standout capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summarize</strong>: Quickly review key takeaways from course content for faster learning.</li>
<li><strong>Test</strong>: Reinforce your understanding with knowledge checks before moving forward.</li>
<li><strong>Explain</strong>: Get clear, practical explanations that connect theory to application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ela isn&#8217;t just limited to courses—she also provides hands-on lab support, helping you troubleshoot code, find bugs, and clarify lab tasks.</p>
<p>This is a game-changer for learners who want real-time, expert-level support while mastering Azure.</p>
<h2>Get Ready for Certification</h2>
<p>If you’ve been thinking about getting Azure certified, this benefit will help you get there faster. With <strong>23 certification prep courses,</strong> you’ll go beyond just memorization and apply what you learn through a mix of lessons, hands-on labs, quizzes, and exams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes it’s the little things in life that matter the most. In the latest version of Visual Studio, we’ve added some features and tweaks that aim to put a smile on your face and make you more productive. Here is a list of some of these, and if you want the full list, make sure to check out the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes">release notes</a>.</p>
<h2>Customize file encoding</h2>
<p>Developers working in cross-platform environments often need files to be saved with specific file encodings. Changing these encodings can lead to various issues.</p>
<p>Visual Studio now allows you to set the default file encoding for saving files. This feature ensures that your preferred encoding is used whenever possible.</p>
<p>To set the default encoding, navigate to <strong>Tools → Options → Environment → Documents</strong>. There, you will find an option titled <strong>Save files with a specific encoding</strong>. If this option is unchecked, Visual Studio will manage file encoding using its default behavior. If checked, Visual Studio will use the encoding specified in the adjacent combo box whenever a file is saved.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-252559" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/word-image-252558-1.png" alt="Image showing save file option with the following option Western European (Windows) - Code page 1252" width="500" height="165" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/word-image-252558-1.png 500w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/word-image-252558-1-300x99.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>If Visual Studio cannot save with the specified encoding (e.g., requesting <em>ASCII</em> encoding for a file containing Unicode characters), it will display a dialog informing you of the issue.</p>
<h2>Choose whether to indent word wrap</h2>
<p>We are excited to introduce a new feature that allows you to control whether wrapped lines are indented in the editor. This enhancement provides greater flexibility and customization for your coding environment, ensuring that your code appears exactly as you prefer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-252560" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/word-image-252558-2.png" alt="code with word wrapped enabled" width="500" height="226" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/word-image-252558-2.png 500w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/word-image-252558-2-300x136.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>To change this option, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Tools → Options → Text Editor → General</strong>.</li>
<li>Look for the option called <strong>Automatically indent when word wrap is enabled</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>By default, this option is enabled, meaning that wrapped lines will be indented. If you prefer your wrapped lines not to be indented, simply uncheck this option. This setting can help improve readability and maintain the desired formatting of your code, especially in projects where indentation style is crucial.</p>
<h2>Preserve font preferences across themes</h2>
<p>We understand that the fonts developers select when coding is a personal choice, influenced by preferences for readability, accessibility, or aesthetics. Visual Studio themes primarily focus on presentation colors and are independent of your preferred fonts.</p>
<p>With this update, we&#8217;ve introduced functionality to retain your font face and size choices when switching themes. You can now set your font preferences once and switch themes in Visual Studio without needing to reconfigure your font settings every time. Note that the colors of your fonts remain linked to the theme, as that is the purpose of themes, but your font selections will be preserved.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-252561" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/word-image-252558-3.png" alt="2 themes that have that stay the same" width="500" height="281" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/word-image-252558-3.png 500w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/word-image-252558-3-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>This feature will be enabled by default for all users. If you prefer the previous behavior, go to <strong>Tools &gt; Manage Preview Features</strong> and find the option <strong>Separate font settings from color theme selection</strong>. If this option is checked, your font preferences will be maintained regardless of theme changes. Uncheck the box to reinstate the previous behavior which ties font choices to theme.</p>
<h2>Reimagine the horizontal scrollbar</h2>
<p>The editor tray in Visual Studio is a valuable space for a wealth of information. You can control your zoom, check the health of your document, see what line you&#8217;re on, and access a variety of additional information.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sometimes all of that information can crowd out the horizontal scrollbar, making it difficult to scroll through your window. This is particularly true in a side-by-side view where the system tray isn&#8217;t very wide.</p>
<p>With this latest update, these struggles are a thing of the past. If the scrollbar drops below a usable width, it will reposition itself above the system tray to ensure it&#8217;s always accessible. By default, it will return to the editor tray as soon as there&#8217;s enough room for it again.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-252562" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/word-image-252558-4.png" alt="Highlighting the horizontal bar" width="500" height="281" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/word-image-252558-4.png 500w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/word-image-252558-4-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>While we believe this behavior will be ideal for most users, if you encounter any issues, you can control the behavior in <strong>Tools → Options</strong>. The option is located under <strong>Text Editor → Advanced</strong> and is labeled <strong>Editor horizontal scrollbar location</strong>. This setting allows you to choose whether the scrollbar adjusts its position according to the available space, stays in the editor tray, or always appears above the editor tray.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-252563" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/word-image-252558-5.png" alt="Options to change horizontal bar behavior " width="574" height="134" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/word-image-252558-5.png 574w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/word-image-252558-5-300x70.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Discovering issues with code changes after committing changes can be frustrating. Fortunately, Visual Studio offers a new feature that helps you catch potential problems early, improving your code quality.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-252506" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/02/word-image-252505-1.png" alt="copilot giving a suggestion on new code on how to improve it" width="900" height="503" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/02/word-image-252505-1.png 900w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/02/word-image-252505-1-300x168.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/02/word-image-252505-1-768x429.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Visual Studio now includes a feature powered by GitHub Copilot that lets you review your local code changes before committing them, before they are part of your pull request. This can help identify performance and security issues early, ensuring you maintain a higher quality codebase.</p>
<h2>How to Get Started</h2>
<p>To use this feature, ensure your GitHub Copilot subscription is active and enabled within Visual Studio. If you don’t already have GitHub Copilot, you can sign up for free <a href="https://github.com/settings/copilot">here</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll need to enable the necessary feature flags:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools &gt; Options &gt; Preview Features &gt; Pull Request Comments</li>
<li>Tools &gt; Options &gt; GitHub &gt; Copilot &gt; Source Control Integration &gt; Enable Git preview features.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, you&#8217;ll see a new sparkle comment button in the Git Changes window. Clicking this button allows GitHub Copilot to review your local code changes and provide inline suggestions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-252507" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/02/word-image-252505-2.png" alt="Copilot reviews changes and suggests commit improvements" width="500" height="272" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/02/word-image-252505-2.png 500w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/02/word-image-252505-2-300x163.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>As always with AI powered features, you’ll want to review Copilot’s suggestions for accuracy, which you can do directly in your working file. You can navigate between comments or collapse them using the up arrow icon in the top right corner of the comment box.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been frustrated when Copilot doesn’t understand you? While it can’t read your mind, we’ve been working hard to make your coding experience smoother.</p>
<p>Previously, Copilot in Visual Studio could look at files in your repository, but you needed to specify the context of your code manually. We understand this wasn’t the most intuitive experience, so we’ve been working on a smarter way to infer information automatically.</p>
<h2><strong>Introducing Tool Calling: A Smarter Copilot</strong></h2>
<p>Tool Calling is here—a major update that changes how you interact with Copilot. Now, Copilot can automatically search for more relevant code or tools it needs to address your questions. This works with GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet.</p>
<p>You can now simply describe what you need in natural language, and Copilot can decide what of the information below is relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your current file</li>
<li>Open files or related files in your solution</li>
<li>Your whole codebase</li>
<li>debugger (locals, call stacks, etc.)</li>
<li>or Visual Studio itself</li>
</ul>
<p>Web integration is also coming soon, allowing you to ask questions that span both local code and external data sources. (But for now you can use @GitHub.)</p>
<p><iframe title="Function calling in GitHub Copilot" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hALZoDdY8-w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>And that’s not all we added….</p>
<h2><strong>Smarter Knowledge Retrieval</strong></h2>
<h4><strong>Even more transparency and control</strong></h4>
<p>While Tool Calling is a significant improvement, it’s not perfect. To tweak any missteps, try the Retry button to generate a fresh response. You can also manually specify files, methods, classes, or entire solutions using # references in your prompts.</p>
<h4><strong>Help Shape the Future</strong></h4>
<p>Tool Calling enables both enhanced context retrieval and greater workflow automation. Please update to the latest version of Visual Studio to access upcoming features. We also invite you to try Chat again and share your feedback—let us know what works, what doesn’t, and how we can improve your experience.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
