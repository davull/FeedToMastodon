You see, smartphones can’t live forever. Or at least, manufacturers choose to drop support for older models as their popularity diminishes and newer software packages become more complex. Can you imagine an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/iphone-3gs-610078/review">iPhone 3GS</a> running iOS 26? It’d be like asking Tiny Tim to bench press 300 lbs.</p><p>Now, the models I've picked out below aren’t on that level just yet – and in many cases, they’ll receive one or two more major OS updates, which is worth bearing in mind if you're looking for a low-cost, short-term upgrade.</p><p>But if you’re planning on keeping your next phone for more than two years (as you should do), you’re better off choosing a model that’ll remain supported until at least 2028. If not, you can expect your apps to stop working and your security to be compromised sooner rather than later.</p><h2 id="phones-to-avoid-this-black-friday-2">Phones to avoid this Black Friday</h2><ul><li><strong>Nothing Phone 2</strong> (no longer expected to receive major OS updates)</li><li><strong>OnePlus 11</strong> (expected to stop receiving major OS updates in 2026)</li><li><strong>iPhone 13 </strong>(expected to stop receiving major OS updates in 2027)</li><li><strong>iPhone 13 Pro </strong>(expected to stop receiving major OS updates in 2027)</li><li><strong>iPhone 13 Pro Max </strong>(expected to stop receiving major OS updates in 2027)</li><li><strong>iPhone 13 mini </strong>(expected to stop receiving major OS updates in 2027)</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S23 </strong>(expected to stop receiving major OS updates in 2027)</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S23 Plus </strong>(expected to stop receiving major OS updates in 2027)</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra </strong>(expected to stop receiving major OS updates in 2027)</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S23 FE </strong>(expected to stop receiving major OS updates in 2027)</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</strong> (expected to stop receiving major OS updates in 2027)</li><li><strong>Google Pixel 7 </strong>(expected to stop receiving major OS updates in 2027)</li><li><strong>Google Pixel 7 Pro </strong>(expected to stop receiving major OS updates in 2027)</li></ul><p>It goes without saying that any devices older than those listed above (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-12">iPhone 12</a>, for instance) should also be avoided this Black Friday, while any successors are likely safe from obsolescence for at least three more years.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AgNSpdNcgcs4Y7CU3aYdG4" name="Samsung Galaxy S24 hands on handheld back straight white.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 hands on handheld back straight white" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AgNSpdNcgcs4Y7CU3aYdG4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Samsung improved its update commitment on the Galaxy S24 series (above)  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future | Roland Moore-Colyer)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Deals on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S24</a> series, for instance, are worth looking out for over the coming weeks, as are offers on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-14-review">iPhone 14</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a> series.</p><p>I'll be returning to normal duty and recommending a whole host of worthwhile phone deals from today onwards, so stick with TechRadar for the low-down on the latest discounts.

It brings with the perfect opportunity for you to not only save on big-ticket tech items, but to also get your Christmas gift shopping sorted.</p><p><strong>• </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com.au/blackfriday"><strong>Shop all Amazon Black Friday deals</strong></a></p><p>My team and I have gone through the thousands of offers of the online retail giant's site and have handpicked our favourites. They cover a wide gamut of tech categories – from headphones to cameras, vacuum cleaners to kitchen appliances. even phones, tablets and the humble ereader.</p><p>While there are no Prime-exclusive deals that we could find – this sale is open to everyone to shop – having a subscription ensures free and expedited delivery. If you've never tried Amazon Prime before, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com.au/tryprimefree">sign up now and get yourself a free 30-day free trial</a> that you can cancel any time if you don't want to pay the ongoing AU$9.99 subscription fee.</p><p>Now, it's only the start of the sale – we've got a long way to go and Amazon has a penchant for changing its offers over the Black Friday sales period. So bookmark this page and stick with us until the sale ends on December 1 (aka Cyber Monday) as we bring you the latest deals and updates.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-useful-amazon-links"><span>Useful Amazon links</span></h3><ul><li><strong>Amazon devices: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/primebigdealdays?bubble-id=deals-collection-amazon-devices">save on Kindles, Echos, Fire TV Sticks and Ring</a></li><li><strong>Lightning deals:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/primebigdealdays?bubble-id=deals-collection-lightning-deals">hurry – limited time offers on limited stocks</a></li><li><strong>Deals ending tonight:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/primebigdealdays?bubble-id=discounts-collection-deals-ending-today">offers ending at midnight each day</a></li><li><strong>Bestsellers in electronics:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/bestsellers/electronics/">Amazon devices, chargers, batteries & more</a></li><li><strong>Audible: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Audible-Books-and-Originals/b/?ie=UTF8&node=3969341051">3 months for just AU$0.99 + AU$20 voucher</a></li><li><strong>Music Unlimited:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/music/unlimited">3 months free (then AU$13.99p/m)</a></li><li><strong>Kindle Unlimited:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku">3 months free (then AU$13.99p/m)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/b?node=212354899051">Amazon Christmas store</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/gift-cards/b/?ie=UTF8&node=5264602051">Amazon gift cards</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/b?node=210976756051">Amazon voucher hub</a></li></ul><h2 id="best-amazon-black-friday-2025-deals-2">Best Amazon Black Friday 2025 deals</h2><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-phones-tablets"><span>Phones & tablets</span></h3><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="bce521a6-5476-4744-96c7-f47200997e34" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="best cheap phones in Australia" data-dimension48="best cheap phones in Australia" data-dimension25="$572" href="https://www.amazon.com.au/motorola-Edge-60-Fusion-Amazonite/dp/B0F7WSQ7S8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="WbESVHDEdNCnaaUG9t7fzF" name="Edge 60 Fusion" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WbESVHDEdNCnaaUG9t7fzF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>One of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/au/best/best-cheap-phones" data-dimension112="bce521a6-5476-4744-96c7-f47200997e34" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="best cheap phones in Australia" data-dimension48="best cheap phones in Australia" data-dimension25="$572">best cheap phones in Australia</a>, this Motorola handset is packed full of value if you don't need the latest and bestest phone on the market.

Gamers will appreciate the TV’s dual HDMI inputs with 4K 144Hz and FreeSync Premium VRR support, and the crisp and responsive gameplay.</p><p>One of the best things about the Hisense U65QF is its value for money. We gave it high marks for that in our review, and also predicted that the U65QF would see good discounts during the upcoming holiday sales season.

Even without the visceral on-stage moment of CEO Tim Cook emerging from the shadows to unveil a huge helping of Apple platform excitement, this was momentous.</p><p>As I wrote back then:</p><p>"One world, one universe, one platform, unification. Apple’s momentous Worldwide Developer’s Conference keynote just painted a picture of a world in which the walls come down and, from the silicon underneath to the pixels in front of your face, Apple’s ecosystem becomes one."</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What Apple Silicon will bring to the Mac. #WWDC20 #WWDC2020 pic.twitter.com/oqJ4MtG8zV<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1275134664198557701">June 22, 2020</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Apple switching hardware platforms was not unheard of – after all, only 14 years earlier, it had migrated its systems from IBM and Motorola's PowerPC to Intel.</p><p>This time, though, was different. Like an 'A' student preparing for finals, Apple was deeply prepped for this new transition. It used XCode to rewrite all its first-party apps, and worked with major partners like Microsoft and Adobe to ensure that core third-party apps were able to run on the revolutionary new hardware. There was even a Developers Transition Kit ready to go for app partners.</p><p>Rosetta 2, a software compatibility layer, was also released, promising to ease the transition for non-Arm-ready apps.</p><h2 id="silicon-promise-2">Silicon promise</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7vj2bzDM6o9hiqSPb5ndPQ" name="MacBook-Air-M1" alt="The original MacBook Air M1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7vj2bzDM6o9hiqSPb5ndPQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lance Ulanoff)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Back then, I was well aware of the potential benefits of a five-nanometer, power-saving platform. It was the holy grail of mobile computing, one that Microsoft had already approached, though less successfully, with Windows on Arm in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review">Surface X Pro</a>, which ran on the SQ2 chip.</p><p>Apple silicon would transform MacBooks from decent battery performers to 17-hour marathoners. I had my concerns about the integrated graphics, but also knew that graphics performance on Apple's bespoke A-series chips on the iPhone and iPad was always stellar, so I also had reason for hope.</p><p>I saw the potential, writing, "What Apple’s doing is switching all its systems from running on a variety of fuels, like wind, solar, and gas, to just one that might arguably be described as rocket fuel."</p><p>And yet, I had no intention of switching from Windows to Mac.</p><h2 id="i-had-my-reasons-2">I had my reasons</h2><p>It's not that I was unfamiliar with the Mac. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/desktop-pcs/apple-mac-at-40-i-watched-it-change-everything-including-me">I'd used the OG Macintosh</a> in the 1980s but switched for good to Windows when I joined <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcmag.com/authors/lance-ulanoff" target="_blank">PCMag</a> in the early 1990s.</p><p>Windows was for me like an old but beloved car. It could be clunky and even sometimes break down in the middle of the road, but I knew every control and contour. It molded to me, and I, a bit, to it. I knew its foibles, but also knew how to work around them. That no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-windows-laptop">Windows laptop</a> could ever give me more than five hours of battery life (on a good day) was something I accepted, along with the fact that I felt like the blue screen of death was always lurking around some unforeseen corner.</p><p>Barely five months after the announcement, and developers got their hands on the transition kit, which, among other things, helped them build Universal apps for all systems running Apple silicon. I reviewed the first Apple MacBook Air with the M1 chip.  I called it "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medium.com/@LanceUlanoff/apple-macbook-air-with-apple-m1-chip-is-an-astonishing-breakthrough-82943dcfc652" target="_blank">an astonishing breakthrough</a>."</p><p>Benchmarks made a mockery of even Intel Core i7 systems, especially in the area of integrated graphics. Battery life was incredible, ranging between 15 and 20 hours. I knew, intuitively, that such a system could transform my life.</p><p>Even so, the idea of switching from Windows to macOS (the operating system Macs run) was daunting. I think I worried that, with time, I might discover that most of my key apps didn't work on Apple silicon or that Apple wouldn't meet its two-year deadline of fully transitioning away from Intel, and that it might even abandon the project altogether and return to Intel.</p><p>I needn't have worried. By 2023, even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/finally-apple-launches-mac-pro-workstation-with-m2-ultra-silicon">Mac Pro had switched to an M2 Ultra</a>. I was impressed with Apple's innovative approach to producing ever more powerful Apple silicon chips, often by clustering them together (the M2 Ultra really is two M2 Max chips). What's more, I never found an app that wouldn't run on Apple silicon.</p><h2 id="making-the-change-and-what-might-have-been-2">Making the change and what might have been</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZdtTbgaj8rxFVcDr4njtzi" name="Apple-MacBook-Air-M2.jpg" alt="Lance Ulanoff and Apple MacBook Air M2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZdtTbgaj8rxFVcDr4njtzi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The first time I touched a MacBook Air M2, until I started using it permanently. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Three years into the Apple silicon journey, I switched to the M2 MacBook Air and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/features/ive-been-using-a-macbook-air-for-a-month-and-no-i-dont-miss-windows">documented the effort in a journal</a>. There were some struggles, but almost all of them revolved around long-standing differences between macOS and Windows. I was forced to learn many new keyboard commands and shortcuts.</p><p>Two weeks into my journey, I wrote:</p><p>"Becoming second nature to use the Mac. Will I ever go back?"</p><p>Spoiler alert: I never did.</p><p>If Apple had failed to deliver on the Apple silicon promise it made on June 22, 2020, this would've been a different story (one that might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/this-is-what-really-happened-with-siri-and-apple-intelligence-according-to-apple">more closely resemble Apple Intelligence</a>). The fact that it made the effort early on to make the hard stuff look easy (supporting all those apps, making different platform apps work on different systems, making it rock-solid stable, and providing industry-leading efficiency) put the wind at Apple silicon's back. Apple showed immediate commitment by unveiling the MacBook Air M1, along with an iMac and a Mac Mini in those first six months.</p><p>Apple has never looked back and continues to build and innovate on the Apple silicon platform to deliver more powerful mobile CPUs. It's only in the last year or so that, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/vehicle-tech/believe-the-hype-qualcomms-snapdragon-8-elite-will-change-everything-about-smartphones">with the help of Qualcomm</a>, the Windows world has started to catch up, nearly matching Apple silicon in performance, efficiency, and stability.</p><p>Apple silicon changed the computing world, but it also changed me. I walked away from a platform I loved (and still have affection for) and have not looked back. Apple's market share has grown on the back of Apple silicon, and, and least in that Mac space, I think the best is yet to come.</p><p><em></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&gl=GB&ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

Those who own, or are going to buy, a Samsung product and are also with British Gas in the UK (or sign up with the energy provider) can benefit from some major savings on their electricity bill at the weekend.</p><p>This comes courtesy of a new tariff called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/uk/british-gas-and-samsung-launch-new-tariff-with-one-more-day-of-half-price-electricity-hours-added" target="_blank">Samsung Weekend Saver Fix</a>, whereby you get half-price electricity between the hours of 11am to 4pm on both Saturday and Sunday.</p><p>It's an expansion of an existing British Gas tariff called PeakSave which grants 50% off your electricity on Sunday at said hours, but with the new tariff in conjunction with Samsung, you get this on Saturday as well – doubling your weekend savings.</p><p>Well, in theory anyway, but obviously it depends on how much electric you actually get through on those respective days.</p><h2 id="so-how-does-this-work-and-what-do-you-need-to-qualify-2">So how does this work and what do you need to qualify?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="khp5PzNVsFE8gbX2Xs6bLN" name="PXL_20250918_111749630.MP" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/khp5PzNVsFE8gbX2Xs6bLN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Blue Pixl Media)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, you need to be signed up for British Gas, or switch to the provider, to get one of its tariffs. Then to qualify for the Samsung Weekend Saver Fix tariff, you need to own, or buy, an eligible Samsung product within the next year, up until October 31, 2026. You also need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/the-post-quantum-smart-meter-challenge-that-could-cut-off-households">smart meter</a>, and a Samsung account.</p><p>You can apply for the Samsung tariff by logging into said Samsung account and clicking on the link to the British Gas Samsung Tariff page.</p><p>Only one tariff can be attached to any given Samsung product, and devices that have been bought via an auction site (like eBay) or third-party seller (on the likes of Amazon marketplace) don't count – so no second-hand or refurbished devices qualify. You must have bought the product new from a retailer in England, Scotland, or Wales (Northern Ireland is excluded, unfortunately).</p><p>For a list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://images.samsung.com/is/content/samsung/assets/uk/britishgas/PromotionTerms.pdf" target="_blank">products which are eligible check Samsung's list</a> (where you'll also find the full terms and conditions for this offer). Those products include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a> and tablets, Samsung's white goods, TVs, monitors, soundbars, and air source heat pumps among other hardware.</p><p>It should be noted that this offer replaces the PeakSave tariff, for those who already subscribe to the latter – the savings aren't cumulative (and you can't combine this tariff with other offers from British Gas, either).</p><p>As a final note, those who take up the Samsung tariff before the end of 2025 will be entered into a draw, with three prize winners set to be picked who will receive a payment of £1,755 each (the average cost of utility bills for a year in the UK). That draw takes place on January 14, 2026.

While the $20,000 (or $499-a-month-for-ever rental) robot is designed for autonomy, the reality is that it could encounter numerous unknown scenarios in your home. In those instances, 1X technicians can, with your permission, take over, teleoperate, and ostensibly train the robot's Redwood AI.</p><p>In even casual conversations with people, this news gives them pause, but we decided to survey our nearly half a million WhatsApp followers with this question:</p><p>"The 1X Neo is a new $20,000 home robot that can be remotely controlled by a human.

Back in 2019, as Sony was unveiling its latest refresh of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tech/ive-been-testing-sony-aibo-for-25-years-and-its-still-my-favorite-robot">AIBO robot dog</a>, some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/yes-the-robot-dog-ate-your-privacy/" target="_blank">expressed concerns</a> about a mobile robot with a camera in its snout, the embedded facial recognition AI (useful for AIBO remembering family faces), and Sony's access to any collected data.</p><p>At the time, Sony stored data locally and in its cloud, but hashed it in a way that was not identifiable as personal info. Even so, the robot couldn't be sold in Illinois because its capabilities skirted outside the state's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3004&ChapterID=57#top">Biometric Information Privacy Act</a>.</p><p>With 1X's far more powerful AI and models, one might assume that the privacy concerns should triple.</p><p>I asked technology and regulatory lawyer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathleen-mcgee-1bba0931/" target="_blank">Kathleen McGee</a> over email just how concerned consumers should be.</p><p>McGee, who previously served as a government lawyer and most recently Bureau Chief of Internet & Technology at the New York Attorney General’s Office and is now Partner in Lowenstein Sandler’s Data Privacy, Security, Safety & Risk Management Practice told me the data companies like 1X collect "ranges from the mundane (where you place your dish soap) to the very personal (real-time video capture of your home, physical layout, and the images of you and your household occupants, including children). Any data collection that is that sensitive and ongoing requires high-level security measures to ensure that data is anonymized, only kept as necessary, and that the AI model(s) are being trained in accordance with ethical standards as well as legal ones."<br><br>Clarity, McGee notes, is key. "Presumptive users of these products should be very clear about how the data is being used and shared, and what rights users have to delete data – when an AI model is created and trained on your sensitive data, it is virtually impossible to completely unwind."</p><p>1X, though, does make it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.1x.tech/neo" target="_blank">clear in its FAQ</a> that while the data collected from "real world tasks" is used to build NEO's base intelligence and boost both its capabilities and safety, "we do not use this data to build a profile of you, nor do we sell this data. If you don’t want to participate in helping improve NEO further, you can always opt out."</p><p>Data aside, though, a robo-roving camera attached to fully articulated limbs and hands raises the specter of a remote-controlled ransack of your home. Reddit is well-stocked with these concerns.</p><div><blockquote><p>Presumptive users of these products should be very clear about how the data is being used and shared</p><p>Kathleen McGee</p></blockquote></div><p>In a scathing Neo robot privacy concern post, Reddit user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1omq93w/the_neo_robot_from_1x_might_be_the_biggest/" target="_blank">GrandyRetroCandy wrote</a> :</p><p>“If law enforcement goes to the 1X office. Says 'we have a warrant'. They may order an operator to take control of the Neo Robot, and while you are out shopping or are away from home, they could make this robot look through your wallet. Your diary. Your house. Your drawers. And see everything about you.,"</p><p>That does sound terrifying, but GrandRetroCandy quickly clarified,</p><p>"Technically, that part is not legal. It's technically possible (it could be done), but it's not legal. But if they do have a warrant, they can see all of the camera footage that is stored from your Neo Robot. That part is legal."</p><p>McGee also told me, "Another concern generally for these types of domestic products is the potential exposure of data that a user may believe is private to them but which may be the subject of a subpoena, search warrant, or threat actor intrusion.  The privacy concerns for users cannot be divorced from the security issues."</p><h2 id="ai-needs-your-data-and-you-need-your-privacy-2">AI needs your data...and you need your privacy</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8s8vpRVZPyDa27NSctTWRJ" name="1X_NEO-B_Grandpa" alt="1X Neo Beta" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8s8vpRVZPyDa27NSctTWRJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 1X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Basically, the idea of anyone suddenly using X1 Neo to roam your home and go through your things is well beyond the realm of likelihood, if not possibility.</p><p>The truth is, humanoid robots will never become practical and useful without healthy amounts of data input from every user and home, especially in the early days when they are bound to make mistakes.</p><p>For robotics and automation, one of the major advancements in recent years has been simulated training. It's helped autonomous driving and many of these early humanoid robots. And yes, we can see how hard it is to get humanoid robots prepared for the unexpected.</p><p>At this point, 1X Neo Beta is so unprepared that most of its abilities are teleoperated. Getting humanoid robots ready for the spotlight remains hard work. In Russia, the Idol robot was so unprepared for the bright lights of fame that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/ai-platforms-assistants/watch-this-the-latest-humanoid-robots-are-both-unnervingly-sassy-and-comfortingly-error-prone">it spectacularly face-planted</a>.</p><p>Giving freely of data that cannot be used to invade our privacy will help these robots learn and improve quickly, but there must be limits and controls.</p><p>A big part of the responsibility lies with companies like 1X, especially those that develop AI. As McGee pointed out in an email, "Many jurisdictions have privacy laws, and for AI developers, the focus should always be on adherence to the most stringent of those regulations.

Covering the basics of artificial intelligence, we'll show you how to get the most from the likes of ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude, alongside in-depth features, news, and the main talking points in the world of AI.</p></div></div><p>We all like the idea of looking after our mental health. Journaling every day, sticking to a meditation routine, and booking therapy sessions when we need them. The reality is usually less polished. Life gets busy, bad habits creep in, and the good intentions fall to the bottom of the to-do list. That’s where AI tools are starting to play an interesting role.</p><p>They’re not a replacement for professional care, but they can be a useful support system. Think of them as scaffolding that keeps you steady when things feel shaky. Whether it’s a chatbot that helps you reflect on your day, an app that suggests breathing exercises, or a tool that turns your messy thoughts into something you can act on, AI is giving people new ways to take care of themselves.</p><h2 id="journaling-without-the-blank-page-2">Journaling without the blank page</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Gv9deEvoZpUzvkUuUUT54J" name="Shutterstock_2314057513.jpg" alt="Apple Journal app on phone screen stock image." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gv9deEvoZpUzvkUuUUT54J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4800" height="2700" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: sdx15 via Shutterstock)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Journaling is one of those habits that sounds simple but often falls apart in practice. You sit down with a notebook or an app, stare at the page, and think: What do I even write? ChatGPT can step in by acting as a gentle prompt engine.</p><p>A basic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/chatgpt-explained">ChatGPT</a> session can nudge you with questions. “What went well today?” “What challenged you?” “What’s one thing you’re grateful for?” It feels less like homework and more like a conversation. When I tried this approach, I found myself writing more honestly because I wasn’t trying to invent a structure. ChatGPT provided it for me.</p><p>Over time, this turns into a habit. Instead of skipping journaling because you don’t know where to start, you can open ChatGPT, answer the prompts, and get your thoughts down. That simple consistency is often what makes the difference.</p><h2 id="building-wellbeing-routines-2">Building wellbeing routines</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1150px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="KJhpJtbgBNe8MQJ6zDzPVB" name="OneOdio OpenRock Pro runner.jpg" alt="OneOdio OpenRock Pro worn by a runner, running on a pier" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KJhpJtbgBNe8MQJ6zDzPVB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1150" height="647" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OneOdio)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sticking to a routine is one of the hardest parts of self-care. Meditation, exercise, reading before bed are all things we know help, but they’re also the first to vanish when life gets stressful. ChatGPT can help by acting as a personal coach.</p><p>You can set it up to remind you to meditate at the same time each day, or to suggest short workouts you can do at home with no equipment. I asked for “five-minute breathing exercises I can do at my desk” and was given a set of techniques complete with step-by-step instructions. It’s not groundbreaking, but it makes the practice accessible.</p><p>The key here is accountability. AI doesn’t get tired of reminding you, and it doesn’t judge if you miss a day. It just nudges you back on track.</p><h2 id="therapy-support-not-replacement-2">Therapy support, not replacement</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.60%;"><img id="p8a2RidshtSAWMtQWPVTbe" name="AI header.jpg" alt="AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p8a2RidshtSAWMtQWPVTbe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="646" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shutterstock)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There’s a lot of hype around ChatGPT as a form of therapy. The truth is, no chatbot can replace a trained professional, but that doesn’t mean they’re useless. Used responsibly, ChatGPT can provide day-to-day support by helping you process small stresses before they spiral.</p><p>I often use ChatGPT as a sounding board to help rationalise situations. Recently, I typed out a stressful work scenario, and the bot asked me questions that nudged me toward a calmer perspective. It wasn’t therapy in the formal sense, but it felt like having someone remind me to take a breath and look at the situation differently. It’s absolutely worth noting, however, that ChatGPT tends to agree with you, which isn’t always the most helpful in sticky situations.</p><p>ChatGPT can be especially helpful between sessions if you already see a therapist. Instead of bottling things up for a week, you can offload in the moment and arrive at your session with more clarity.</p><h2 id="self-diagnosis-the-double-edged-sword-2">Self-diagnosis: the double-edged sword</h2><p>One of the most controversial areas of ChatGPT is self-diagnosis. Search engines already encourage people to Google every symptom, and AI makes that process even easier. You can ask for a breakdown of possible conditions, complete with explanations and suggested next steps.</p><p>Used carefully, this can be empowering. For example, when I had recurring stomach issues, I asked ChatGPT for possible causes. It flagged everything from diet to stress to IBS, and reminded me to consult a doctor. That gave me language to use in my appointment and made me feel more prepared.</p><p>But there’s a risk here too. AI is not infallible, and it can give false reassurance or unnecessary panic. If you use it as a first step rather than a final answer, it’s useful. If you use it to avoid medical care, it’s dangerous.</p><p>The best balance is to treat ChatGPT as a research assistant. It can gather information, explain things in plain English, and prepare you for a conversation with a professional. It cannot and should not replace that professional.</p><h2 id="tracking-your-mood-2">Tracking your mood</h2><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title"></div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3GyfDKwcvLbYMkx8ztYNGc" name="guidetochatgpt" caption="" alt="Essential Guide to ChatGPT bookazine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3GyfDKwcvLbYMkx8ztYNGc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">This article originally appeared as part of <em>Essential Guide to ChatGPT</em>, available now at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/us/essential-guide-to-chatgpt/dp/305c36c2">MyFavoriteMagazines</a>. <em>Essential Guide to ChatGPT</em> is full of top tips and expert advice, covering everything you need to know about the world’s most popular AI – from the basics to some of its latest features and functions.</p></div></div><p>Another subtle but powerful use of ChatGPT is mood tracking. Instead of manually logging how you feel, AI can analyse your journal entries, messages, or even tone of voice to spot patterns. Over time, it can tell you if certain days, activities, or habits are linked to dips in mood.</p><p>For example, I noticed that my journal entries mentioning late-night screen time often coincided with lower mood scores. That connection helped me cut down on doomscrolling before bed. Without AI analysing the data, I might not have noticed the link (let’s face it, I know the link, but I’ll not stop doing it anytime soon).</p><h2 id="encouraging-mindfulness-2">Encouraging mindfulness</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WRRhKiV9uvEwz6C3wmXjJd" name="organoid-intelligence-16-9-Shutterstock_1682262673.jpg" alt="Double exposure of creative light bulb hologram with human brain on laptop background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WRRhKiV9uvEwz6C3wmXjJd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shutterstock / Pixels hunter)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Mindfulness is one of those buzzwords that gets thrown around a lot, but at its core, it just means paying attention to the present. ChatGPT can help by guiding short sessions of meditation or reflection.</p><p>Ask for a five-minute body scan or a short gratitude exercise, and you’ll get a script you can follow. It’s a simple way to integrate mindfulness into a busy day without committing to long sessions or expensive courses.</p><h2 id="guardrails-you-need-in-place-2">Guardrails you need in place</h2><p>As useful as ChatGPT can be, there are guardrails you need to respect. First, privacy. You’re often sharing sensitive thoughts or health data, so you need to check how that information is stored and used.</p><p>Second, accuracy. AI can sometimes produce confident answers that are simply wrong. Always cross-check health advice with a professional source.</p><p>Third, dependency. It’s easy to lean too heavily on a chatbot. The goal should be to use AI as a tool that supports healthy habits, not as a crutch that replaces human connection.</p><h2 id="why-chatgpt-works-as-a-companion-2">Why ChatGPT works as a companion</h2><p>The biggest value of ChatGPT in this space is companionship. It gives you a low-pressure outlet for your thoughts, prompts you when you need structure, and helps you build routines that stick. It’s not a replacement for human relationships or professional care, but it fills a gap.</p><p>When I use AI for journaling or mindfulness, I don’t feel like I’m outsourcing self-care. I feel like I have a supportive presence that keeps me accountable. That makes it easier to keep going, even on the days when motivation is low.</p><p>Well-being isn’t about doing everything perfectly. It’s about having the right tools to support you when life gets messy. AI fits into that toolkit by making self-care more accessible and less overwhelming.</p><p>It can prompt you to journal, remind you to breathe, help you notice patterns in your mood, and prepare you for conversations with professionals. The responsibility is still yours, but the scaffolding is there.</p><p>If you treat ChatGPT as a companion rather than a cure, you’ll find it can make a real difference. And sometimes that gentle nudge to reflect or breathe is exactly what you need.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&gl=GB&ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

I've listed their most recent price as a marker, although these excellent noise-cancelling over-ears actually launched at £349, so if we're taking that price, your saving is far more impressive… anyway, they're a stone cold hit, and again, this is over £19 cheaper than we've <em>ever</em> seen them sell for (and TechRadar monitors these things closely).

A win or a draw for the hosts would see them advance to the World Cup, but a big win for the visitors could see them snatch top spot in Group A.</p><p>Beaten 2-0 in their opening group game by Slovakia, Germany have responded in excellent fashion by delivering four straight victories. Julian Nagelsmann's side have secured a place in the top two but will have to avoid defeat to finish top of the group and automatically advance to next summer’s tournament. Die Nationalelf will be missing a number of important players for the crunch clash, but will hope Nick Woltemade can deliver another big performance after his brace against Luxembourg.</p><p>Level on points with Germany after the 1-0 win over Northern Ireland last time out, Slovakia enter the game safe in the knowledge they will finish in the top two. However, they will be keen to avoid the lottery of the playoffs and will be looking for a repeat of the game in Bratislava. The Falcons have won two of their last three games against the Germans so should be full of confidence as they look to reach the World Cup for the first time since 2010.</p><p>Read on as we explain how you can watch Germany vs Slovakia in the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers, including free options.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-germany-vs-slovakia-team-news"><span>Germany vs Slovakia team news</span></h3><p><strong>Germany XI:</strong> Baumann; Kimmich, Tah, Schlotterbeck, Raum; Goretzka, Pavlovic; Sane, Wirtz, Gnabry; Woltemade</p><p><strong>Slovakia XI: </strong>Dúbravka; Gyömber, Skiriniar, Obert, Hancko; Lobotka, Duda, Bero ; Duris, Strelec, Sauer</p><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Can I watch Germany vs Slovakia for free?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Germany vs Slovakia will be free-to-view for German residents with <a href="https://www.zdf.de/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ZDF</a> showing all the action. </p><p>Looking for English commentary? <a href="https://play.virginmediatelevision.ie/account/login?WebsiteViewerRequest=5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Virgin Media Play</a> are showing all the action for free to Irish residents.</p><p>Traveling abroad right now?

Last Saturday (November 15), leaked footage from the film, which is being shot in New Zealand, found its way online and appears to have revealed an addition to its cast that hasn't been publicly acknowledged by Nintendo.</p><p>The secretly-filmed video begins with the camera trained on Bragason's Zelda, who walks over to a pair of horses. It's here where she's greeted by another actor, who seems to resemble Impa, Zelda's chief aide in Nintendo's hugely successful game franchise.</p><p>As the camera zooms in, we get a much better look at who may be playing Impa (or whoever this individual is). And, while it's difficult to fully make out the actor in question, they look a <em>lot</em> like Dichen Lachman, aka the Australian star who viewers may recognize as Ms. Casey from sci-fi hit<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/severance"><em>Severance</em></a> on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-tv-plus-cost-review-and-everything-you-need-to-know">Apple TV</a>.</p><p>The leaked clip raises more questions about <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> movie's plot. Will this mystery character be part of proceedings in its first act or throughout? Is one of the horses Epona, Link's trusty steed who might initially be under Zelda's care in this film? And, perhaps most importantly, are Zelda and her lieutenant traveling in secret to avoid being detected and/or found by Ganandorf, <em>The Legend of</em> <em>Zelda</em> franchise's Big Bad?</p><p>I'm sure we'll get answers to any or all of the above in due course. For now, here's that all-important release date information: <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> <em>Movie </em>will arrive in theaters worldwide on May 7, 2027.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&gl=GB&ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

Other users can join via a shareable link, with up to 20 participants supported in this trial.</p><p>A separate group chat section in the sidebar gets created for users to quickly revert back to their conversations, and just like a human, ChatGPT can even react to messages with an emoji.</p><p>OpenAI confirmed that the feature runs on GPT-5.1 Auto, the latest model family, and that it supports search, file upload, image generation, dictation and other popular features. Custom instructions can also be provided per group chat.</p><p>It’s unclear why Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan are the first countries to get access to ChatGPT group chats, but OpenAI does promise to add more regions after a period of user feedback.</p><p><em></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&gl=GB&ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <ul><li><strong>Google has upgraded its AI-powered travel tools</strong></li><li><strong>The AI can plan custom itineraries, find flight deals, and handle reservations</strong></li><li><strong>Agentic booking will reserve restaurants, tickets, and appointments directly from Search, with flights and hotels coming soon</strong></li></ul><p>If you’ve ever tried planning a vacation and found yourself drowning in tabs, Google has some news that might make your holidays a little less chaotic. Or at least reduce the tab clutter. Google rolled out a trio of travel upgrades powered by its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/ai-platforms-assistants/gemini/google-may-soon-switch-to-ai-mode-for-search-and-youll-just-have-to-deal-with-it">AI Mode in Search</a>.</p><p>The features aim to ease the most annoying parts of travel planning: comparing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/ive-been-using-googles-new-ai-mode-for-search-heres-how-to-master-it">too many option</a>s, flipping between booking sites, and trying to figure out where to stay, eat, and what to do in between eating and sleeping. The new tools include smarter itinerary building with Canvas, global expansion of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/ai-platforms-assistants/gemini/google-flight-deals-is-basically-an-ai-travel-agent-for-finding-your-next-trip">AI-powered Flight Deals search</a>, and expanded agentic booking capabilities.</p><p>The biggest change is thanks to the new Canvas for Travel within AI Mode, designed to help you plan a journey. It helps build custom itineraries based on requests as simple or detailed as “I want to take a five-day trip to Austin with my family next spring and get in some good barbecue and live music not too far from the hotel.” The AI will immediately start assembling a plan inside Canvas.</p><div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oNWxuoaGdoqNBb8jGFzNN4/Canvas%20for%20travel%20planning%20-%20AI%20Mode.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oNWxuoaGdoqNBb8jGFzNN4/Canvas%20for%20travel%20planning%20-%20AI%20Mode.mp4"></video></div><p>The plan that pops up pulls together real-time data from Google Flights and Hotels, reviews and photos from Google Maps, and curated info from across the web. You’ll get options, suggestions, and comparisons, like which hotel has better reviews for its breakfast versus which one has the pool your kids will actually use.</p><p>And it’s not a static spreadsheet either. Canvas is interactive, so you can nudge it toward better brunch spots, make tradeoffs based on location, or ask the AI to update your plans if your flight dates shift.</p><h2 id="flights-and-virtual-agents-2">Flights and virtual agents</h2><div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RCriNMmGUDzPyrWgoJk5Do/Flight%20Deals%20-%20English.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RCriNMmGUDzPyrWgoJk5Do/Flight%20Deals%20-%20English.mp4"></video></div><p>And the AI in Flight Deals could reduce the cost of your trip. After testing in the U.S., Canada, and India, Flight Deals is now global in over 200 countries and supports more than 60 languages.</p><p>The idea is that you don’t need to know exactly where or when you want to go. Just type something like “cheap flights for a long weekend from New York in February” or “someplace warm with beaches and good food,” and Flight Deals will generate a list of destinations that fit based on affordability, timing, and traveler preferences.</p><p>It's the expanded agentic AI for bookings that really grabs attention, however. Google has now extended agentic booking capabilities to more U.S. users in AI Mode, starting with restaurants. You describe what you want, and it goes to work, searching across OpenTable, Resy, and Tock to find real-time availability that fits your request, and offering a short list with booking links ready to go.</p><div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ssuvULDnEzkpbWrcp8nAXn/Agentic%20restaurant%20booking%20-%20AI%20Mode.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ssuvULDnEzkpbWrcp8nAXn/Agentic%20restaurant%20booking%20-%20AI%20Mode.mp4"></video></div><p>For U.S. Labs users, that same magic is also available for event tickets and local appointments. You can now start a plan with a single sentence instead of seven browser tabs and a phone call.</p><p>Booking for flights and hotels isn’t ready yet, but Google says it’s coming, as shown in the demo below. The company is already collaborating with major travel partners like Expedia, Marriott, Booking.com, and Wyndham to build out direct booking through AI Mode in the near future.</p><p>In theory, this could create a seamless loop where your vague desire for “a sunny, relaxing getaway in early March” becomes a full itinerary, complete with flights, a hotel near the best-rated tacos, an afternoon spa appointment, and a reservation for sunset cocktails, all without ever leaving the search bar.</p><div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MHCdUYuJXU89ZLqGeimW8/Preview%20-%20agentic%20travel%20booking.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MHCdUYuJXU89ZLqGeimW8/Preview%20-%20agentic%20travel%20booking.mp4"></video></div><p>The usual concerns about bias and privacy are, as always, left only vaguely addressed by Google. But for now at least, Google’s pitch isn’t about replacing human judgment, just saving people time.</p><p>There are also practical implications for how we decide where to go and what to do. On the positive side, AI nudging us toward more affordable flights and recommending off-the-radar experiences is a nice way to expand people's horizons. Then again, too many people might just ruin those vistas.</p><p>Whether it changes the future of travel remains to be seen. But if it means one less argument over who forgot to book the hotel, it might be worth letting AI navigate or even take the wheel for part of the journey.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&gl=GB&ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

So as you keep watching, you'll see things that Dick goes through and just know I'm having a blast.</p><p>"I'm having a blast because it's so awesome to be put in the most uncomfortable positions and have to fight my way out of them."</p><p>We're four episodes into <em>Welcome to Derry </em>at the time of writing, and we've already seen some <em>very </em>shocking scenes. If anything, it seems the HBO Max show is about to dial that up, as Chalk teased a moment between him and Jovan Adepo's Major Leroy Hanlon.</p><p>Chalk admitted that playing Dick Hallorann took him to places he'd never gone before, describing the experience as a "gift". "There's a set piece that happens between me and Jovan, that was the one scene that I was so grateful for because it allowed me to be at a place that I, Chris Chalk, don't normally go," he said.</p><p>"I'm kind of stoic, I'm like a comic stoic.

Right now, you can get an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Newest-Battery-Video-Doorbell-release/dp/B0F2GP448V/ref=sr_1_1">Amazon Echo Dot smart speaker together with a Ring Battery Video Doorbell for just £59.99</a> (was <del>£154.99</del> when bought separately). To put that into context, the Echo Dot is currently selling for £54.99 so you're essentially getting a wireless Ring doorbell for just £5.</p><p>The Ring Battery Video Doorbell is super easy to install (just screw its mounting plate onto the wall and clip it in), and with the Echo Dot you can answer the door and chat with callers from anywhere in the house. If you don't yet own any smart home devices, it's the perfect introduction.</p><p><strong>• </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/deals">Shop Amazon's full Black Friday sale</a></p><p>You don't need a Ring subscription to use the Ring Battery Video Doorbell's basic functions (such as chatting live with callers) but signing up for the monthly plan will unlock extras like package and person notifications, and cloud storage for your video clips. For more details, take a look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/home/smart-home/do-i-need-a-ring-subscription-heres-what-to-consider">my guide to Ring Home subscriptions</a> – and stick with TechRadar for all of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-sales-2024">Black Friday deals</a>.</p><p><em>(Not in the UK?

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>With Black Friday PS5 discounts on the horizon, we are now deep into gift-buying territory - and I have the perfect suggestion for anyone looking for a PlayStation gift.</p><p>And if you're on the hunt for such a gift, then let me point you toward Sony's range of limited edition PS5 DualSense controllers. Now, a little over five years on from the PS5's release, there's a whole host of limited edition and special edition hardware - and none are better, in my view, than the DualSense controllers.</p><p>Not only are extra DualSense controllers eminently useful and welcome to one's setup, but these special edition pads are great for preserving memories, reviving favorite moments. They're wonderful celebrations of games and PlayStation, which is why they are such great gift ideas.</p><p>Take the God of War 20th Anniversary controller, for example. It's a pretty simple design on the whole with a white-grey primary colorway evoking the tone of Kratos' skin, accentuated by the gray of the thumbsticks, all wonderfully contrasted by the crimson red tattoo design on the right-hand side of the pad. It's the kind of controller that will instantly take a PlayStation gamer back into <em>God of War</em> games and the most iconic moments in the famous series.</p><p>I wrote about this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/ps5/with-memories-and-moments-dotted-across-its-design-the-last-of-us-limited-edition-dualsense-is-perfect-for-mega-fans-like-me">memory-giving concept with The Last of Us Part 2 Limited Edition DualSense</a> and stand by it from a fan and collector perspective. Its design wasn't just things from a game; it was covered with memories and moments that I had in the game.</p><p>While that pad celebrating Naughty Dog's game isn't available anymore, it's my pleasure to provide you with a whole host of the best links to such controllers below for your gifting needs.</p><p>From the aforementioned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller-god-of-war-20th-anniversary-limited-edition"><em>God of War</em> 20th anniversary</a> pad and both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense%C2%AE-Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FMKQFNFN"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> controllers</a>, to the ever-present <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller-fortnite-limited-edition"><em>Fortnite </em>pad</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-limited-edition"><em>Death Stranding 2</em> controller</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FPMXPK34/"><em>Astro Bot</em> Joyful</a> controller, there's a range of brilliant controllers out there.</p><p>There's even some elusive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/buy-accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller-30th-anniversary-limited-edition">30th Anniversary Edition controller</a> stock in the UK for PlayStation collectors and gamers of a certain vintage.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-us-limited-edition-dualsense-controllers"><span>US Limited Edition DualSense controllers</span></h3><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="cc627244-e279-4d6c-8de9-de5073eb24e2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Also available at: Walmart -

That's an amazing deal, especially considering the Osmo 360 already beats the GoPro Max 2 and Insta360 X5 for value. DJI seems well and truly intent on pricing out its rivals (though GoPro is already discounting its new 360 camera too – the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wexphotovideo.com/gopro-max2-3277587/">Max 2 is now just £349 at WEX</a>).</p><p>You get a lot of camera for your money, as our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/cameras/360-cameras/dji-osmo-360-review">Osmo 360 review</a> points out: class-leading 1.1-inch sensors, 8K 360 video recording, versatile mount options and built-in storage.

The Osmo 360 has plenty going for it, including class-leading 1.1-inch sensors for superb low light quality. It also serves audiophiles well with a seamless wireless connection to one of DJI's remote mics, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/cameras/camera-accessories/dji-mic-mini-review-the-tiny-wireless-mic-to-beat-for-smartphone-first-content-creators">Mic Mini</a>.</p><p>DJI probably wishes its Osmo 360 featured swappable lenses, given both the Max 2 and X5 allow for this cost effective fix should either lens get damaged. Overall though, the Osmo 360 isn't far behind the X5 or Max 2 at all.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ABkBzi3ceHCdpTLctGrnkj" name="DJI Osmo 360 vs Insta360 X5" alt="DJI Osmo 360 and Insta360 X5 cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ABkBzi3ceHCdpTLctGrnkj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Osmo 360 alongside the Insta360 X5 during our hands-on comparison tests. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future | Sam Kieldsen)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It feels like rivals have the hardware edge in terms of ruggedness, but DJI clearly wins in the value department. The Osmo 360 already cost much less than its competitors, and now with this major price cut, it is clearly the value 360 camera to get. Similarly priced models such as the older Insta360 X4 can't compete, and the Osmo 360 in another league to the budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/cameras/360-cameras/akaso-360-review">Akaso 360</a>.</p><p>If you're starting out from scratch, the Osmo 360 feels like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-360-degree-camera">best 360 camera</a> deal to get, though I would opt for the pricier Adventure Combo mentioned above, because a selfie stick is pretty much an essential accessory. Still, that bundle with numerous accessories even costs less than the Insta360 accessory-less bundles.

It starts with a compromised GMX Mail account. This is a free consumer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-email-provider" target="_blank">email service</a> from Germany which allows users to create up to ten sender addresses from a single account.</p><p>The compromised accounts are used to send fraudulent emails, pretending to come from an HR department of a company, which are designed to look like automated, notification emails, carrying the Teams branding.</p><h2 id="phishing-for-access-2">Phishing for access</h2><p>The usual themes are:</p><p>A large “Join the meeting now” call-to-action link<br>A Meeting ID and Passcode section<br>A fake “Organizer” section styled to mirror authentic Teams invites</p><p>If the victim takes the bait and clicks on the provided link, they will be redirected to a compromised Azure Web App that asks the visitor to make an OAuth authorization and grant permissions to the Microsoft account. The crooks tried to mask the fact that this is a web app by titling it “Please confirm attendance - meeting request”.</p><p>Granting this malicious web app access gives it permissions to sign in, read the profile, maintain access even after the password is changed, access emails and email data, send emails, steal files, and more.</p><p>The researchers believe GMX was chosen for this particular feature, since it allows the attackers to easily rotate identities without setting up new infrastructure, cutting down on time needed to prepare the attack.</p><p>Another reason why GMX might have been chosen is the fact that the messages successfully pass SPF, DKIM, and DMARC validation, and end up in people’s inboxes. For Abnormal, this is an “unusual level” of technical legitimacy.</p><p>The best way to defend against phishing is to simply think before you click - check the sender’s email address, hover over links to spot fishy redirects, and be wary of emails with a high sense of urgency.</p><p><em></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&gl=GB&ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

Now, Masimo has been awarded a mammoth $634m in the case, and there are potentially significant implications for fans of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-apple-watch">best Apple Watches</a>.</p><p>The case traces back to 2020, when Masimo filed a lawsuit alleging that Apple had infringed upon several of Masimo’s patents. As a result of that case, Apple was banned from shipping smartwatches with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/apple-watch-blood-oxygen-feature-isnt-returning-anytime-soon-as-company-fails-in-audacious-court-bid-to-get-ban-lifted">blood oxygen monitoring feature</a> in the US – a ban that is still in place. That means that while Apple Watch fans in the rest of the world can use the feature, it’s disabled in any Apple smartwatches that reach the hands of American customers.</p><p>Technically, the decision didn’t stop Apple from selling the Apple Watch completely – as long as the blood oxygen feature was not present, Apple could continue shipping the device. That led to Apple implementing a solution whereby the blood oxygen monitoring tech is still present in the Apple Watch but is disabled on the software level for US customers.</p><p>Thanks to a creative workaround from Apple, there is one way to get blood oxygen monitoring on your Apple Watch, but it requires <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/blood-oxygen-tracking-is-back-on-the-apple-watch-in-the-us-but-its-now-a-two-device-experience">enlisting the help of an iPhone</a>. That means it’s far from the streamlined method Apple first implemented and that the company no doubt wants to return to.</p><p>In any case, that was all before the latest court decision. Now, a jury has decided that Apple infringed upon Masimo’s intellectual property, with the $643m in damages set to become one of the largest fines for a consumer technology case in the history of the Central District of California court system.</p><h2 id="what-next-2">What next?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4608px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Hpwr9C87CnHAabm87UmLM" name="P1011179.JPG" alt="Apple Watch 6 Blood Oxygen app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Hpwr9C87CnHAabm87UmLM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4608" height="2592" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Sawh)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Although a judgement has been reached, the case is far from over. That’s because Apple states it disagrees with the verdict and has signaled its intention to appeal. In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/11/15/masimo-awarded-634m-in-apple-watch-patent-infringement-verdict" target="_blank">AppleInsider</a>, Apple said:</p><p>“We disagree with today's decision, which we believe is contrary to the facts. Masimo is a medical device company that does not sell any products to consumers. Over the past six years they have sued Apple in multiple courts and asserted over 25 patents, the majority of which have been found to be invalid. The single patent in this case expired in 2022, and is specific to historic patient monitoring technology from decades ago. We plan to appeal.”</p><p>That means that for now, nothing much changes. US-based Apple Watch customers will still be unable to use the Apple Watch’s blood oxygen feature, while users elsewhere should remain unaffected.</p><p>Until the appeal is heard and a decision is reached there, we suspect things will continue much as they are, with neither Apple nor Masimo appearing to be willing to give in.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&gl=GB&ceid=GB%3Aen"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a><em> and </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

It seems it's quite a complicated process.</p><p>The delay notwithstanding, it's still great news for sports fans, who are getting a whole host of extra channels and events with their YouTube TV subscription – even if they have to keep switching between different apps for the time being.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see if this has any impact on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/2025s-first-streaming-price-hike-will-come-courtesy-of-youtube-tv-and-im-concerned-which-service-is-next">YouTube TV pricing</a>.

The pattern is familiar. It starts with a mix of hype, fear, and confusion.</p><p>Today, leaders and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/best-employee-management-software-of-year">employees</a> alike question whether <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-ai-tools">AI</a> is truly necessary or if it risks more than it rewards.</p><p>Fast on the heels of investment, skepticism often follows, although 76% of enterprises are exploring GenAI for innovation, only about 40% of consumers trust generative AI outputs, citing worries about accuracy and transparency.</p><p>The truth is, AI isn’t some brand-new alien force. It’s been part of our daily lives for decades.</p><p>Recommendation engines on Amazon, Netflix queues, voice assistants like Siri, even the Roomba you set loose in your living room.</p><p>These are all AI. The difference is that generative AI feels closer, touching how we write, code, and create. That proximity makes the stakes feel higher.</p><p>But this time A, is hitting a little different. And it's not all about automating tasks in the background. AI is colliding head on with knowledge workers and this is making people uneasy. Is “expertise” itself up for debate?</p><h2 id="all-gas-no-brakes-2">All gas, no brakes</h2><p>Adoption of AI is doing anything but cooling off.  In 2024 alone, U.S. private AI investment grew to $109.1 billion, attracting $33.9 billion globally in private investment, an 18.7% increase from 2023.</p><p>The underlying AI technologies have matured over decades, but the leap in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/best-llms">LLMs</a>  capable of producing text, images, and code, has thrust the technology into the cultural spotlight like never before.</p><p>This acceleration has intensified the pace of change, forcing organizations to make adoption decisions under heightened public scrutiny. Boards are pushing for speed, while regulators and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-internet-security-suites">security</a> teams are still trying to set the necessary ground rules.</p><p>What’s truly different this time is the perceived immediacy of impact. GenAI touches knowledge work directly, challenging the established norms around expertise, authorship, and control over intellectual output.</p><p>That’s creating friction between innovation advocates and those wary of eroding human judgment. The result is a polarizing debate, inconsistent adoption strategies, new security threat vectors and regulators pointing fingers like the spiderman meme.</p><p>Especially for sectors like law, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-personal-finance-software">finance</a>, healthcare, and academia, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Trust and reputation are its currency. At the same time, resisting adoption entirely can mean falling behind competitors who are getting ahead of AI and making it work for them.</p><p>If adoption races ahead without safeguards, institutions risk losing credibility with customers, regulators, and their own people who might prefer to head to a competitor who’s getting it right.</p><p>On the flip side, dismissing AI altogether and sitting on the side of the pool is just as dangerous. our competitors have already jumped in the deep end with AI.</p><h2 id="fear-vs-fomo-misses-the-point-2">Fear vs. FOMO misses the point</h2><p>The AI conversation is in need of moving beyond fear-based binaries. Like calculators in the classroom or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-email-provider">email</a> in the workplace, AI is not inherently good or bad. Put simply, it's a capability or co-intelligence.</p><p>The real differentiator is how leaders guide adoption and balance technical safeguards with cultural adaptation. The differentiator will be leadership and AI startups that are chipping away at the old guard, showing how to integrate AI deliberately with the right guardrails, culture, security and transparency.</p><p>For CISOs, CIOs, and other decision-makers, the goal should be to reject the false choice between total embrace and outright ban. Instead, organizations should be aiming for deliberate integration, run a PoC and be anchored in transparent governance.</p><p>Host lunch-and-learns to foster user education, and establish a clear alignment of organizational values and culture with AI. The human effect still matters. Especially now.</p><h2 id="a-teaching-moment-for-all-2">A teaching moment for all</h2><p>When it comes to AI, getting clear on what “expertise” means should be a priority. Get a birdseye view of what's possible and what's already going on.</p><p>Take a fresh look at your workflows and figure out where AI can take the busywork off people’s plates, and where you still need human judgment in the driver’s seat.</p><p>Don’t be afraid to be explicit about where you need human judgment and where AI can safely take on repetitive work. There must be full visibility because when you leave it vague it can be up for widespread interpretations.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-online-cyber-security-courses">cybersecurity</a>, this clarity shows up every day. I have seen AI help filter through thousands of alerts that would otherwise bury a security team. The model does the grunt work and flags patterns that look suspicious. The human then steps in and decides if it is noise or a real attack.</p><p>When that line is clear the team stays sharp. When it is not clear the team either trusts the model too much or drowns in alerts. The stakes are high because one missed decision can be the difference between blocking an intrusion and reading about it later in the news.</p><p>By giving full, maybe even sometimes tedious explanations on how AI can be used, what data it can touch, how outputs will be validated, and how credit is assigned you’re off on the right foot.</p><p>When you make AI everyone’s business it becomes much easier to ensure that your employees have the rights and wrongs on lock, because AI know-how shouldn’t live in the IT department alone. If only IT understands the risks, you’re sunk.</p><p>Give people across the organization the tools and knowledge to use it responsibly, from spotting bias to knowing when to trust, or question its answers.</p><p>Start small but learn fast by testing AI in low-risk areas first, see what works, and tweak as you go. Keep an eye on how it’s performing with Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). Measure what matters. Let the business knowledge workers build the metrics and KPI’s. Make QA cool again.</p><h2 id="the-printing-press-calculator-and-now-ai-2">The printing press, calculator… and now AI</h2><p>When AI is done right it sharpens the edge. The printing press did not end learning. The calculator did not kill math. Email did not destroy productivity. Each one raised the floor and gave people space to work on what mattered more.</p><p>AI should be treated the same way. It is not here to erase trust or weaken systems. It is here to amplify what people do when paired with clear governance and accountability. Progress lasts when people see it makes life better without taking away integrity.</p><p>Trust is not earned by press releases. It is earned by proof. Show employees that AI has guardrails. Show customers that security and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/anonymous-browsing">privacy</a> come first. That is how credibility takes hold.</p><p>Credibility lasts when AI is transparent and accountable. That is how we defend trust in cybersecurity and that is how we shape the future.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-encryption-software"><em>We've featured the best encryption software.</em></a></p><p><em>This article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

That point being, as Douse posts on X, that there's "genuinely no point making a high-spec Steam Machine" as Valve is betting on enthusiast gamers knowing "how to turn any PC into a Steam Machine" if they want a more powerful rig.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Value are probably betting on the fact that anyone who wants more demanding PC hardware on their TV is part of the audience who know how to turn any PC into a Steam Machine.

That's what's happened with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a> and the bunch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-handheld-games-consoles">handhelds</a> which have followed, and Valve is hoping to mirror that success here.</p><p>The theory is that there will eventually be a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gaming-pcs/valve-could-shake-up-the-console-gaming-space-but-for-now-here-are-4-things-the-steam-machine-means-for-pc-gamers">whole ecosystem of mini PCs</a> running SteamOS springing up, and even if Valve isn't selling the hardware in all cases, it's still selling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-pc-games">PC games</a> via Steam for all these devices.</p><h2 id="analysis-indie-games-and-the-temple-of-steam-2">Analysis: indie games and the temple of Steam</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hu8VDCFtRdkPJ4X6r5S2AZ" name="Steam" alt="Steam logo in front of an array of PC games" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hu8VDCFtRdkPJ4X6r5S2AZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Steam)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is the gist of something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/pc-gaming/the-steam-deck-2-sounds-like-itll-be-a-huge-leap-in-performance-but-theres-one-big-reason-why-it-doesnt-exist-yet">I've touched on recently elsewhere</a>, namely that this isn't really about hardware, but software. As noted, if other third-party Steam Machines are built, Valve still profits from the owners of those PCs buying games on Steam. Moreover, it's going to push adoption of Linux gaming to bigger numbers (SteamOS is based on Linux, remember).</p><p>The dream will doubtless be for game developers to start taking Linux more seriously and considering compatibility issues more – and problematic elements like anti-cheat tools for online games (which are a serious spanner in the works currently).</p><p>So, it all comes back to the software: driving forward with SteamOS, while accelerating games sales on Steam itself.</p><p>The obvious reason why the Steam Machine is relatively modest in terms of its performance ceiling, judging from the hardware chosen, is because Valve wants to be able to price the cube at an affordable level.</p><p>This brave new world of a new way of gaming in the living room won't happen if the Steam Machine seems expensive, and the big hope is that Valve will really go hard on pricing. Mainly because it makes sense that this is the approach and intended angle, given that Valve could certainly have gone a bit further in terms of pushing the hardware spec.</p><p>However, we don't yet have any kind of actual hint as to what pricing might be. The general hope is for something like a $499 PC (in the US) here – though some are more optimistic than that – but the actual cost may yet be affected by some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/laptops/watch-out-laptop-buyers-ram-based-price-hikes-could-be-in-the-cards-soon-and-they-might-be-big">unfortunate winds blowing in the components arena</a> right now. Those market forces are pushing up the cost of memory, meaning <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/building-your-dream-pc-may-soon-take-longer-and-cost-more-shortages-mean-some-shops-are-now-limiting-ssd-hdd-and-ram-purchases-to-prevent-hoarding">more expensive RAM and SSDs</a>, which could be a pricing snag when it comes to production time for the Steam Machine.</p><p>Valve must, of course, bear in mind that the Steam Machine will need to deal with the question – "why should I buy this rather than a PS5 or Xbox?" – based on the relative cost of these living-room gaming boxes. Although when it comes to game pricing, there are a lot of cheap games (and big sales) on Steam, and an expansive library of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-indie-games">quality indie titles</a> – all of which could be tempting selling points for more casual gamers, again.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&gl=GB&ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

This scale of information is pivotal for discovery, but only if it can be organized, and made usable.</p><p>While data is the bedrock of the life sciences industry, big data introduces practical challenges, not just in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-cloud-storage">storage</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-security-key">security</a>, but in turning information into actionable insight.</p><h2 id="the-benefits-of-big-data-in-life-sciences-2">The benefits of big data in life sciences</h2><ul><li>Identifying trends early: Big data allows scientists to detect patterns that help predict disease outbreaks, track disease progression, and guide preventative measures. This can ultimately save lives.</li><li>Designing targeted medicine: By combining genomic, clinical, and lifestyle data, researchers can design treatment plans tailored to individual patients. This improves outcomes and accelerates precision medicine.</li><li>Making better decisions: Big data analytics empowers researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to make more informed, evidence-based decisions about care and resource allocation.</li></ul><h2 id="the-complexities-of-big-data-in-life-sciences-2">The complexities of big data in life sciences</h2><p>While big data certainly offers great value for life sciences, it’s worth briefly considering some of the challenges that make managing scientific data uniquely complex. These can be grouped into two broad categories: infrastructure and data itself.</p><p><strong>Infrastructure complexity</strong></p><p>The scale and speed of data generation in biopharma R&D demand flexible, high-performance infrastructure. Traditional on-premise systems struggle to keep up with the volume and velocity of scientific data, especially as instruments, sensors, and models generate continuous streams of information.</p><p>Cloud-based, software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms however are helping to overcome this barrier by providing elastic scalability, built-in security, and simplified data access. This allows scientists to focus on research rather than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-infrastructure-management-service">infrastructure</a> management.</p><p><strong>Data diversity and integration</strong></p><p>In life science research, data comes in many forms - structured clinical trial tables, semi-structured instrument outputs, and unstructured lab notes or images. This “variety” makes it difficult to consolidate and analyze results across experiments and teams.</p><p>Effective big-data management therefore relies on platforms that can unify these sources, maintain scientific context, and support collaboration across discovery, development, and clinical environments.</p><h2 id="responsible-data-management-in-biopharma-r-d-2">Responsible data management in biopharma R&D</h2><p>Managing big data responsibly presents significant challenges for life sciences organizations, from protecting sensitive information to ensuring that data remains usable and connected across the research landscape.</p><p>The sheer volume of data being generated requires ever-larger, more efficient storage and processing solutions, whilst also creating difficulties for researchers, who must sift through overwhelming amounts of information to find what is relevant and actionable.</p><p>At the same time, the need to protect this data has never been greater. As personal and genomic information becomes more widely collected, organizations must ensure that it is handled securely and in compliance with data protection regulations.</p><p>Any lapse in governance risks not only regulatory penalties but also the erosion of public trust.</p><p>The rise of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-ai-tools">AI</a> analysis tools adds another layer of complexity. While AI can act as a powerful collaborator in managing and interpreting big data, it requires careful oversight, particularly when handling sensitive health information.</p><p>Systems must be transparent, accountable, and rigorously validated to prevent errors or data breaches. A recent McKinsey report notes that AI’s promise lies in augmenting human capability, not replacing it, but that collaboration must be built on trust.</p><p>There is also the potential for bias in AI-driven systems. According to Harvard Online, “Big data algorithms may exhibit bias and discrimination based on factors such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Biased algorithms can perpetuate existing inequalities and undermine trust in automated decision-making systems.”</p><p>Scientific advances are meant to benefit everyone. Addressing these ethical and technical concerns is essential, not only to uphold fairness and accuracy but also to ensure that discoveries are based on reliable, representative data.</p><p>But in life sciences, protecting data is only half the battle. To drive discovery, data must also move freely and retain meaning across the research and clinical continuum. The bottleneck in healthcare innovation today is no longer discovery. It is integration.</p><p>The next evolution in scientific informatics lies in creating a digital thread that connects data across systems and stages, so that every insight, sample, and result remains part of a continuous picture.</p><p>Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and other data platforms are most powerful when they not only collect data but allow scientists to make sense of it.</p><p>The goal is not more data but connected data that fuels better science.</p><h2 id="strategies-for-big-data-management-2">Strategies for big data management</h2><p>The scale and speed of data generation in life sciences demand flexible, scalable, and centralized systems. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-cloud-computing-services">Cloud</a>-based platforms are increasingly preferred for their ability to consolidate data across instruments, systems, and locations.</p><p>Combined with AI and machine learning, they enable researchers to analyze large datasets, identify patterns, and predict emerging trends.</p><p>Yet, despite this potential, the growth of big data has outpaced many organizations' ability to manage it effectively. The challenge now is not collecting more data, it is connecting it, contextualizing it and turning it into valuable insight.</p><p><em></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-cloud-databases"><em>We've featured the best cloud database.</em></a></p><p><em>This article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

Data gathered for one reason is often pressed into service for another reason- a tool built for convenience can become an instrument of control without the correct systems in place.</p><h2 id="an-efficiency-boosting-id-or-all-purpose-surveillance-2">An efficiency boosting ID or all-purpose surveillance?</h2><p>Digital identification is already required in everyday life. KYC for banking, credit checks, passports for travel, visas, and National Insurance numbers. What BritCard proposes is different.</p><p>By merging these functions into a single digital ID, the government could link systems that operate in isolation and promise greater convenience and efficiency. However, whether it is the goal or not, can also feature full-spectrum tracking of people’s movements and interactions both online and offline.</p><p>Recent public reaction shows how contentious this is.</p><p>Almost three million people have already signed a petition demanding the government scrap the plan, warning its implementation is ‘a step towards excessive monitoring and digital control’ or building a ‘switchlever to Orwellian surveillance’ that could be misused in ways similar to China’s social credit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-infrastructure-management-service">infrastructure</a>.</p><p>That concern is not unfounded even if not the intention. Privacy researchers note that some Digital ID architectures include “phone home” features: background functions that report when or where ID credentials are used.</p><p>Even when intended for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-internet-security-suites">security</a> or interoperability, this capability risks turning verification into quiet tracking if left unchecked.</p><p>Without clear safeguards, the ability to restrict access to movement and payments, or linking behavior across services could be knowingly or unknowingly built into its architecture.</p><h2 id="lessons-from-digital-id-around-the-world-2">Lessons from digital ID around the world</h2><p>Digital ID can deliver real benefits when built with the right safeguards, the challenge is ensuring they enhance trust rather than centralize control. Centralized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-database-software">databases</a> must be limited to the minimum necessary information.</p><p>The law must set clear limits on who can use the data and why. Without tight legal and technical safeguards, centralized systems are both surveillance tools and hacker magnets.</p><p>Estonia, often held up as a model, suffered a breach in 2021 that exposed almost one million peoples identity records, including voting, banking and medical records that forced a lockdown on all online services.</p><p>Even advanced systems fail if the architecture concentrates risk. Despite its breach, it has still built seamless e-governance and secure digital signatures because of this technology, its digital ID has enabled citizens to file taxes in minutes, sign contracts remotely, and access nearly all public services online.</p><p>Switzerland, after being rejected in 2021, only secured public support for its national digital ID recently by introducing stronger safeguards and clearer governance. The new voluntary system is issued by the federal government and stores data on users’ devices rather than in a central database.</p><p>It uses selective disclosure to share only what is necessary, relying on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-open-source-software">open-source</a> code that can be publicly audited, and includes a national trust registry to keep issuers accountable. These safeguards put citizens at the center that turned a rejected system into one the public placed its confidence in by vote</p><h2 id="the-architecture-that-decides-between-convenience-and-control-2">The architecture that decides between convenience and control</h2><p>So… how do we stop them becoming surveillance tools? The starting point is a privacy-first architecture based on signed, verifiable data. In practical terms this means credentials that are issued by trusted authorities, held by individuals, and presented selectively.</p><p>Instead of sharing entire identification documents each time, digital ID systems can verify specific information through digitally signed confirmations. For example, a person could confirm they meet certain criteria such as being over 18 or having the right to work without revealing every detail on their ID.</p><p>The verification happens securely between trusted parties, and the underlying data remains protected. The person stays in control of when and where their information is used, and the verifier receives only what is relevant to that interaction.</p><p>For example, a venue checks that you are over 18 without learning your full date of birth, and an employer verifies your right to work without storing a copy of your passport in their database.</p><p>This approach, known as self-sovereign identity (SSI), allows people and institutions to prove facts about themselves without exposing the data behind them. It creates systems that are secure, comparable across borders, and privacy-preserving.</p><p>For governments, SSI could underpin a digital ID framework that strengthens trust and efficiency without enabling mass surveillance, just like Switzerland.</p><p>Digital ID is inevitable. Whether it becomes the backbone of a trusted digital economy or the framework for total surveillance depends on what we build now.</p><p>If the UK chooses a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/anonymous-browsing">privacy</a>-first model, it can maximize efficiencies, delivering speed and security without surrendering control. If it doesn’t, we risk hard-coding a switchlever to Orwellian surveillance into everyday life, efficient, permanent, and impossible to unwind once turned on.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-authenticator-apps"><em>We've featured the best authenticator app.</em></a></p><p><em>This article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

In the storage, they found BeaverTail - an infostealer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-malware-removal" target="_blank">malware</a> and a loader that dropped a Python backdoor named InvisibleFerret, and TsunamiKit.</p><p>The latter is a multi-stage malware toolkit written in Python and .NET, that can serve either as an infostealer, or as a cryptojacker that installs XMRig on the compromised device and forces it to mine the Monero currency.

Covering the basics of artificial intelligence, we'll show you how to get the most from the likes of ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude, alongside in-depth features, news, and the main talking points in the world of AI.</p></div></div><p>I’ll admit it: planning a holiday can be more stressful than the job you’re supposed to be taking a break from. Flights, hotels, itineraries, translations. It’s a mess of tabs, apps, and endless “best places to stay” articles that all seem suspiciously similar.</p><p>So, I did what I always do these days when life admin threatens to derail me: I turned to AI. And honestly? It’s like having the world’s most patient travel agent in your pocket.</p><h2 id="1-pick-the-right-destination-2">1. Pick the right destination</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.87%;"><img id="VFVmFf63dsdzBKCXBvW5B8" name="airplane" alt="airplane" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VFVmFf63dsdzBKCXBvW5B8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="571" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Pixabay)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first challenge when going on holiday is always deciding where to go. You might know you want sunshine or a city break, but the world is a big place. AI can cut through the indecision by helping you narrow things down. Ask it to suggest destinations based on your budget, time of year, and interests, and it will quickly compile a list that makes sense.</p><p>In my example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/chatgpt-explained">ChatGPT</a> offered a mix of classic European getaways and a few more adventurous picks. Denmark and Sweden were obvious, but it also suggested Bulgaria, which I hadn’t even considered. It didn’t just list cities either. It explained why Sofia could be a good choice in November, complete with average temperatures and the bonus of fewer tourists.</p><p>Instead of trawling through generic “top ten destinations” articles, you get suggestions tailored to you. It feels like brainstorming with a travel-savvy friend rather than battling Google search results</p><h2 id="2-find-flights-without-losing-your-sanity-2">2. Find flights without losing your sanity</h2><p>Start with the worst part: flights. Normally, I’d spend hours comparing Skyscanner, Google Flights, and random airline sites, trying to decide whether saving £30 is worth leaving at 6 a.m. with a four-hour layover in Frankfurt. With ChatGPT or Gemini, though, you can set the rules up front. Within seconds, you get a neat shortlist that respects your time as much as your wallet.</p><p>It’s not magic. It’s still pulling from flight data you could find yourself, but the difference is the filter. Instead of manually checking every option, the AI does the tedious comparisons and hands you the good stuff.</p><p>You can even push it further by asking for recommendations on which days to travel. AI will factor in price fluctuations and highlight when you’re better off leaving on a Tuesday instead of a Saturday. This kind of advice used to be buried in forums and travel blogs. Now it’s instant.</p><h2 id="3-hotels-without-the-booking-regret-2">3. Hotels without the booking regret</h2><p>Picking where to sleep is another stress trigger. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve booked a “charming boutique hotel” only to find out “charming” actually means “next to a motorway.” This is where AI shines again. You can ask ChatGPT for a mix of budget, style, and location, and the AI will deliver options you can trust without the usual doomscroll through hundreds of TripAdvisor horror stories.</p><p>It’s not replacing the big booking platforms, but it makes them usable. Instead of endless filters and pop-ups trying to upsell breakfast I don’t want, I get exactly what I asked for.</p><p>Another underrated trick is asking AI to compare hotels across different booking sites. It can flag if Booking.com has a better cancellation policy than Expedia or if the official hotel website is running a discount you might miss. This saves money and avoids the sinking feeling when you realize you could have booked the same room cheaper.</p><h2 id="4-city-guides-that-don-t-feel-generic-2">4. City guides that don’t feel generic</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dv5gs6CVRgMukwsCNMDtLS" name="2.jpg" alt="three photos side by side of New York City" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dv5gs6CVRgMukwsCNMDtLS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here’s where it gets really cool. AI city guides are way better than the “Top 10 Things to Do in…” lists that clog up Google. If you’re heading to Rome, sure, you’ll see the Colosseum. But what about that family-run trattoria where the menu hasn’t changed since the ’70s? AI can personalise your itinerary based on you.</p><p>When I asked for a two-day Kyoto food crawl, I got a plan that jumped between ramen shops, markets, and a whisky bar I’d never have found otherwise. The itinerary included timings, walking directions, and even estimated costs for each stop. It felt like a friend had scribbled a plan for me, not like I’d been handed a tourist brochure.</p><p>Even better, you can mix AI’s recommendations with your own priorities. Want a balance of sightseeing, food, and downtime? Ask for it. Fancy a pub crawl that mixes craft beer with live music? No problem. The itineraries are flexible and easy to tweak, which makes them a nice alternative to static guidebooks.</p><h2 id="5-translation-made-simple-2">5. Translation made simple</h2><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title"></div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3GyfDKwcvLbYMkx8ztYNGc" name="guidetochatgpt" caption="" alt="Essential Guide to ChatGPT bookazine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3GyfDKwcvLbYMkx8ztYNGc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">This article originally appeared as part of <em>Essential Guide to ChatGPT</em>, available now at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/us/essential-guide-to-chatgpt/dp/305c36c2">MyFavoriteMagazines</a>. <em>Essential Guide to ChatGPT</em> is full of top tips and expert advice, covering everything you need to know about the world’s most popular AI – from the basics to some of its latest features and functions.</p></div></div><p>Nothing kills holiday confidence faster than standing in a restaurant abroad, staring at a menu you don’t understand. Traditional translation apps help, but AI has taken things up a notch.</p><p>Apple’s new translation features in iOS, powered by Apple Intelligence, make it possible to have fluid conversations with someone who doesn’t speak your language. I tested it by pretending to chat with my Italian in-laws, and it was surprisingly smooth. Instead of clunky word-by-word translations, it felt like a real conversation.</p><p>I’m a big fan of Apple’s offering, but it doesn’t come close to the prowess of ChatGPT when it comes to translation. ChatGPT allows you to upload images of text in foreign languages and ask for a translation. While booking my holiday to Japan, I’ve accessed lots of Japanese sites with no English translation. Luckily, ChatGPT makes understanding and reading another language incredibly easy.</p><h2 id="6-travel-admin-you-actually-finish-2">6. Travel admin you actually finish</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1742px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="uspgPGFv44fLvJbZbAWE9o" name="Iniu travel power bank" alt="Small Iniu power bank on top of a suitcase next to a passport" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uspgPGFv44fLvJbZbAWE9o.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1742" height="980" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Iniu)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Planning isn’t just about picking fun things to do. There’s the admin side too: visas, insurance, packing lists. These are boring but essential. AI is surprisingly helpful here as well.</p><p>Ask for a packing list for “a week in Barcelona in June, staying in a mid-range hotel, with a focus on food and sightseeing,” and you’ll get a detailed checklist that covers everything from clothes to plug adapters. No more panicked runs to the airport shop because you forgot a charger.</p><p>Visa and entry requirements are another headache. AI can’t replace official government websites, but it can point you in the right direction. If you ask about entry rules for Japan, it will summarise what you need and direct you to the correct official page to double-check. That saves time and avoids falling down a rabbit hole of outdated travel forums.</p><h2 id="7-the-fun-extras-2">7. The fun extras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LhkS2jbTpp3VRpiT7WLer6" name="EJXHM0VXsAIFczi.jpg" alt="The Simpsons on vacation with suitcases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LhkS2jbTpp3VRpiT7WLer6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: FOX)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once the essentials are sorted, you can start using AI for the fun stuff. Want personalised restaurant recommendations that avoid tourist traps? Ask for “hidden gems in Kyoto that locals love” and you’ll get a list of places that rarely show up in mainstream guides.</p><p>Looking for activities for kids? AI will generate itineraries that balance museums, parks, and fun stops without overloading the day. Even better, you can ask it to adjust for the weather. If it rains, your sunny beach day can turn into an indoor adventure plan in minutes.</p><p>For sports fans, AI can even scan local fixtures. Heading to New York? It will tell you if the New York Knicks are playing at Madison Square Garden while you’re in town. That’s the sort of detail that can transform a trip from good to unforgettable.</p><h2 id="why-ai-doesn-t-replace-experience-2">Why AI doesn’t replace experience</h2><p>All of this might sound like AI makes travel planning effortless. It certainly removes a lot of friction, but it’s not perfect. Sometimes the recommendations can be a little too polished or lean heavily on popular spots. That’s why the best approach is to use AI as a starting point, then layer in your own research and instincts.</p><p>AI gives you the scaffolding. You add the colour. That combination is what turns a decent trip into a great one.</p><p>Holidays are meant to be a break, not another spreadsheet of decisions to make. AI helps strip out the boring parts of planning and replaces them with quick, clear answers. You still get to make the choices, but without the noise.</p><p>Whether it’s finding flights that don’t leave at ridiculous times, avoiding hotels that look better in photos than reality, or finally cracking a menu in a language you don’t speak, AI makes the whole process easier. And if you can spend less time planning and more time looking forward to the trip, that feels like the real holiday win.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&gl=GB&ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

The project, which would apparently star Jimmy Olsen, the Daily Planet reporter and unlikely ladies man played by Skyler Gisondo in <em>Superman</em>, was also believed to be called <em>DC Crime</em>.</p><p>Furthermore, the DC Universe (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techradar.com/tag/dcu">DCU</a>) TV Original would reportedly feature the live-action debut of Gorilla Grodd. One of The Flash's most notable enemies, Grodd made a brief cameo in episode 4 of adult animated show <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/creature-commandos"><em>Creature Commandos</em></a>, but will apparently be on key antagonist duties in <em>DC Crime</em>.</p><p>Taking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@jamesgunn/post/DRFjtKkEeFc?xmt=AQF0aPX8O1awFt_jhARBm4kB_A4hiQKAUYz6oGDf8piiVJHEqqZKX9g7JCkuu0Zz-Y5wjgE&slof=1" target="_blank">Threads</a> after a much-needed vacation, though, Gunn categorically denied that one of the above rumors had any substance to it. Indeed, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/dc">DC</a> Studios co-chief refuted suggestions that the program was called <em>DC Crime</em>, before indicating that other elements of what had been reported may be true.</p><p>"Just FYI," he wrote, "there has never been a project titled <em>DC Crime</em> in development, not even as a working title. I don't know where that came from but it's weird. And, no, that doesn't mean all of the rest of the story is false."</p><h2 id="reporting-for-duty-2">Reporting for duty</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yzbAxFjoDX5jUAsYskzKRA" name="superman-jimmy-steve-cat-ron" alt="Cat grant, Lois Lane, Steve Lombard, and Jimmy Olsen looking an off-camera screen in The Daily Planet's newsroom in Superman" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yzbAxFjoDX5jUAsYskzKRA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">There's no word on which Daily Planet characters could feature in this Superman side project </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: DC Studios/Warner Bros.

It's unclear, then, whether Olsen will be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/hbo-max-price-free-trial-movies-the-snyder-cut-and-more-explained">HBO Max</a> show's lead character, if Grodd is involved in this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/superman"><em>Superman</em></a> off-shoot, and when we might see it.</p><p>Even so, the fact that Gunn didn't pore cold water on the whole thing is proof that another post-<em>Superman</em> project is in the works at DC Studios. If you weren't aware, the first of those is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/man-of-tomorrow"><em>Man of Tomorrow</em></a>, aka the movie sequel to the aforementioned film that'll be released in July 2027.</p><p>Considering how much franchise building <em>Superman</em> had to do, some of its ensemble, including many of its Daily Planet characters, were reduced to bit-part roles. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/entertainment/dcu-chapter-one">DCU Chapter One</a> spin-off focusing on this DC comic book institution would go a long way to remedying one of the biggest complaints that some viewers, myself included, had with one of 2025's biggest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/new-movies">new movies</a>.</p><p>While we wait for more news on this show and Gunn's next project, find out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/entertainment/superman-man-of-tomorrow-hub">what we know so far about <em>Man of Tomorrow</em></a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&gl=GB&ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

You can now grab a White, Black, or Red DualSense for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ee.co.uk/products/atp-playstation-5-dualsense-wireless-controller?color=color-code-F4F4F2">just £52.99 (was £60)</a> at EE.</p><p><strong>• </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ee.co.uk/ee-deals/blackfriday">EE Black Friday deals</a></p><p>Given that Black Friday is imminent, it's great to see UK <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-sales-2024">Black Friday deals</a> starting to drop, especially on PS5 controllers. This is perfect for those looking to add another gamepad to their couch co-op setup, or those who've been rocking the same controller since launch.</p><p>If you're a PS5 player, this deal at EE actually offers discounts on the Black, White, and Red variants. The White comes with the console, but as someone who owns the Red PS5 DualSense Controller, I can say it looks terrific side-by-side with the PS5<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ps5">'</a>s base coloring. The Black controller is well worth picking up as well, given that it's more resistant to visually noticeable wear and tear.</p><p><em>(Not in the UK?
