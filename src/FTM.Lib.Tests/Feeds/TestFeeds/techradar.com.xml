<p>Although the likes of Pure Storage, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/writing-is-on-the-wall-for-spinning-rust-ibm-joins-pure-storage-in-claiming-that-disk-drives-will-go-the-way-of-the-dodo-in-enterprises">IBM</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/facebook-engineers-say-that-bigger-hard-disk-drives-is-making-one-critical-metric-far-far-worse">Meta</a> believe the writing is on the wall for hard drives, the technology doesn’t look like it will be going away any time soon.</p><p>Seagate and its main rival Western Digital are working on magnetic recording methods that will allow the drives to continue increasing in capacity, helping them maintain a clear advantage over SSDs when it comes to storage density.</p><p>The main technology leading this charge is HAMR, or heat-assisted magnetic recording, which could see HDDs hitting incredible 100TB capacities. HAMR works by briefly heating the disk surface with a laser to make it easier to write data at higher densities. HDMR - short for heated dot magnetic recording - is HAMR’s likely successor and could lead to even larger drives by focusing the heat and magnetic energy into smaller, more precise areas for even denser data storage.</p>
<h2 id="not-an-unreasonable-outlay-2">Not an unreasonable outlay</h2>
<p>In a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/seagate-hard-drive-technology-innovation-0365da3f" target="_blank"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> article, John Keilman wrote an article covering Seagate’s “fight to store the world’s data”, and mentioned something which caught my attention. “Seagate said two large cloud-computing customers have each ordered one exabyte’s worth of HAMR storage, which works out to tens of thousands of hard drives.”</p><p>Keilman didn’t name names - Seagate wouldn’t have told him who the buyers were - but we can narrow the list of suspects down to the usual big US hyperscalers, including Apple, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta. It’s possible that Chinese hyperscalers could have come shopping for the drives, but that seems unlikely to me.</p><p>Keilman doesn’t say what capacity drives were sold, but we can assume they will have been Seagate’s highest commercial HDD, the Exos M, which ranges from 30TB (CMR) to 36TB (SMR), with a breakthrough 3TB-per-platter density. Based on timing, it’s likely we’re talking about the 30TB models, as the 32TB drive was only added to the range in December 2024, followed by the 36TB model just a month later.</p><p>Assuming the hyperscalers in question paid bulk pricing of around $500 per drive (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/hundreds-of-the-worlds-largest-hard-disk-drive-have-mysteriously-gone-on-sale-online-as-refurbished-model-should-you-buy-them">refurbished models of Seagate's Exos 28TB HDD</a> can currently be purchased for as low as $365), their combined bill likely came to somewhere between $33 and $35 million. For a full exabyte of cutting-edge, high-capacity storage, $16 billion or so isn't an unreasonable outlay.</p><p>Seagate previously revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/seagate-smashes-largest-hdd-world-record-with-36tb-hard-drive-and-reveals-a-60tb-model-is-coming">that a 60TB drive was on its way</a>, and the firm recently announced plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/race-to-100tb-hdd-heats-up-as-seagate-pulls-rug-under-western-digital-toshiba-feet-by-acquiring-hamr-specialist">acquire Intevac, a HAMR specialist</a>, which could help it achieve that 100TB capacity goal faster, as well as ramp up HAMR drive production.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If you've read my previous articles, you should know that PC is my preferred option for gaming. Whether it's with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gaming-computers/handheld-gaming-pcs-are-here-to-stay-heres-why-id-recommend-the-asus-rog-ally-over-a-gaming-laptop-any-day-of-the-week">handheld gaming PCs</a> or a full-fledged desktop setup, I believe it offers the best gaming experiences possible with better performance and advanced graphics options.</p><p>There's also a much greater level of freedom PC players have over console players: lower game prices thanks to digital marketplaces, free multiplayer online access (which shouldn't even be a debate), and modding capabilities all play an integral part. I can't deny that PC gaming isn't cheap, but there also isn't much of an argument when looking at the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/ps5-pro-review">PS5 Pro</a> and its $699.99 / £699.99 / AU$1,199 price - as I've said before, you may as well start saving for a PC build at that price point.</p><p>However, my stance on that has changed at least for the time being - not because I think consoles are more powerful than most PCs, no - but because the current landscape of the GPU market is an <em>absolute</em> mess. Nvidia and AMD both launched new GPUs: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/nvidia-unveils-new-geforce-rtx-5090-rtx-5080-rtx-5070-ti-and-rtx-5070-graphics-cards-at-ces-2025">Blackwell RTX 5000 series</a> and Radeon RX 9000 series respectively, and getting your hands on any of these graphics cards at MSRP (or even at all) is one heck of a mission.</p><p>From scalpers to retailers, you'll more than likely find yourself overpaying for a new mid-range or high-end GPU. Now it's worth mentioning that Intel is also in the mix with its Battlemage Arc B570 and B580 GPUs, but it's got some catching up to do against Team Green and Team Red in terms of performance capabilities and its XeSS upscaling method.</p><p>Ultimately, it means that if there was any opportunity for a large amount of console-only gamers (or even new gamers entirely) to join the PC platform, that chance is nearly dead in the water - and I don't see it getting better anytime soon.</p>
<h2 id="gpus-are-far-too-expensive-and-it-s-completely-unreasonable-2">GPUs are far too expensive and it's completely unreasonable</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1871px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="6iRGWfoYyBbSB6fmLRGrA7" name="shutterstock_2150043493.jpg" alt="Illustration of a generic PC graphics card" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6iRGWfoYyBbSB6fmLRGrA7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1871" height="1052" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Derr / Shutterstock)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's important I note that I absolutely don't expect powerful graphics cards to be cheap, especially considering the advancement of tech and power capabilities we've seen over the years from Nvidia and AMD. Game developers are now able to provide exceptional and immersive gaming experiences with hyper-realistic visuals, thanks to the power provided by GPUs like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/nvidia-rtx-5090-gpu-rumors-possible-specs-and-everything-we-know">RTX 5090</a>.</p><p>This is even possible with midrange cards at high resolutions, with the help of upscaling tools like DLSS and FSR. What I do expect, however, is for hardware to be affordable, especially with less powerful products - and unfortunately, that's the complete opposite of what we're seeing.</p><p>Examples of this are evident with the RTX 5090 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a>: both of these Blackwell GPUs are high-end offerings, priced at <strong>$1,999 / £1,939 / AU$4,039</strong> and <strong>$999 / £999 / AU$2,019</strong> respectively, and will give gamers the best performance possible this generation. Those prices are arguably too high, particularly when the leap from the previous flagship GPU, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090">RTX 4090</a>, is significant but perhaps not enough to pay another $400 above its $1,599 MSRP.</p><p>When you add scalpers, low stock, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/worried-your-nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-or-5070-ti-isnt-performing-as-well-as-it-should-cpu-z-can-now-check-your-gpu-for-missing-rops">hardware issues</a> into the equation, it makes matters worse - and we've seen this occur since board partners are selling the GPUs at inflated prices. It means either you won't find a GPU to buy at all, or if you do, you'll more than likely be overpaying.</p><p>You might be thinking it's best to just buy a midrange GPU, but the exact same thing is happening there too. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/well-amds-radeon-rx-9070-series-launch-isnt-going-as-smoothly-as-we-thought-and-its-because-retailers-have-inflated-prices">AMD's Radeon RX 9070 series GPU prices have seen a sudden hike</a> - so instead of paying $599 / £569 / around AU$944 for the RX 9070 XT, you'll be paying much more.</p><p>It's also worth noting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/another-day-another-dreadful-pc-port-rise-of-the-ronin-joins-the-list-of-woeful-pc-launches-with-even-an-nvidia-rtx-4090-succumbing-to-stutters">PC games are released with bad optimization</a> - so even if you do manage to find a powerhouse GPU without overpaying, you'll have to deal with bad performance and game-breaking bugs.</p>

<p>As a gamer who is on both PC and console, I can totally understand why most console players are hesitant when advised to build <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-gaming-pc">gaming PCs</a>. Yes, I still think PC is the better platform and there's plenty of freedom to be had with your gaming experience - but if you can't even acquire the right hardware at affordable prices, what choice do you have but to stick with a console?</p><p>Again, you may end up building your desired gaming PC and then still be met with frustrating performance problems. While performance may not be as good on console, it's a manageable experience with stable frame rates that come without the need to tinker or mess around with settings.</p><p>I believe it's a big part of why handheld gaming options like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> are so popular: gamers can simply select a game they want to play (with the help of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified" target="_blank">Deck Verified</a>) and dive in.

                            <article>
                                <p>If you've read my previous articles, you should know that PC is my preferred option for gaming. Whether it's with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gaming-computers/handheld-gaming-pcs-are-here-to-stay-heres-why-id-recommend-the-asus-rog-ally-over-a-gaming-laptop-any-day-of-the-week">handheld gaming PCs</a> or a full-fledged desktop setup, I believe it offers the best gaming experiences possible with better performance and advanced graphics options.</p><p>There's also a much greater level of freedom PC players have over console players: lower game prices thanks to digital marketplaces, free multiplayer online access (which shouldn't even be a debate), and modding capabilities all play an integral part. I can't deny that PC gaming isn't cheap, but there also isn't much of an argument when looking at the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/ps5-pro-review">PS5 Pro</a> and its $699.99 / £699.99 / AU$1,199 price - as I've said before, you may as well start saving for a PC build at that price point.</p><p>However, my stance on that has changed at least for the time being - not because I think consoles are more powerful than most PCs, no - but because the current landscape of the GPU market is an <em>absolute</em> mess. Nvidia and AMD both launched new GPUs: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/nvidia-unveils-new-geforce-rtx-5090-rtx-5080-rtx-5070-ti-and-rtx-5070-graphics-cards-at-ces-2025">Blackwell RTX 5000 series</a> and Radeon RX 9000 series respectively, and getting your hands on any of these graphics cards at MSRP (or even at all) is one heck of a mission.</p><p>From scalpers to retailers, you'll more than likely find yourself overpaying for a new mid-range or high-end GPU. Now it's worth mentioning that Intel is also in the mix with its Battlemage Arc B570 and B580 GPUs, but it's got some catching up to do against Team Green and Team Red in terms of performance capabilities and its XeSS upscaling method.</p><p>Ultimately, it means that if there was any opportunity for a large amount of console-only gamers (or even new gamers entirely) to join the PC platform, that chance is nearly dead in the water - and I don't see it getting better anytime soon.</p>
<h2 id="gpus-are-far-too-expensive-and-it-s-completely-unreasonable-6">GPUs are far too expensive and it's completely unreasonable</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1871px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="6iRGWfoYyBbSB6fmLRGrA7" name="shutterstock_2150043493.jpg" alt="Illustration of a generic PC graphics card" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6iRGWfoYyBbSB6fmLRGrA7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1871" height="1052" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Derr / Shutterstock)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's important I note that I absolutely don't expect powerful graphics cards to be cheap, especially considering the advancement of tech and power capabilities we've seen over the years from Nvidia and AMD. Game developers are now able to provide exceptional and immersive gaming experiences with hyper-realistic visuals, thanks to the power provided by GPUs like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/nvidia-rtx-5090-gpu-rumors-possible-specs-and-everything-we-know">RTX 5090</a>.</p><p>This is even possible with midrange cards at high resolutions, with the help of upscaling tools like DLSS and FSR. What I do expect, however, is for hardware to be affordable, especially with less powerful products - and unfortunately, that's the complete opposite of what we're seeing.</p><p>Examples of this are evident with the RTX 5090 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a>: both of these Blackwell GPUs are high-end offerings, priced at <strong>$1,999 / £1,939 / AU$4,039</strong> and <strong>$999 / £999 / AU$2,019</strong> respectively, and will give gamers the best performance possible this generation. Those prices are arguably too high, particularly when the leap from the previous flagship GPU, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090">RTX 4090</a>, is significant but perhaps not enough to pay another $400 above its $1,599 MSRP.</p><p>When you add scalpers, low stock, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/worried-your-nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-or-5070-ti-isnt-performing-as-well-as-it-should-cpu-z-can-now-check-your-gpu-for-missing-rops">hardware issues</a> into the equation, it makes matters worse - and we've seen this occur since board partners are selling the GPUs at inflated prices. It means either you won't find a GPU to buy at all, or if you do, you'll more than likely be overpaying.</p><p>You might be thinking it's best to just buy a midrange GPU, but the exact same thing is happening there too. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/well-amds-radeon-rx-9070-series-launch-isnt-going-as-smoothly-as-we-thought-and-its-because-retailers-have-inflated-prices">AMD's Radeon RX 9070 series GPU prices have seen a sudden hike</a> - so instead of paying $599 / £569 / around AU$944 for the RX 9070 XT, you'll be paying much more.</p><p>It's also worth noting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/another-day-another-dreadful-pc-port-rise-of-the-ronin-joins-the-list-of-woeful-pc-launches-with-even-an-nvidia-rtx-4090-succumbing-to-stutters">PC games are released with bad optimization</a> - so even if you do manage to find a powerhouse GPU without overpaying, you'll have to deal with bad performance and game-breaking bugs.</p>

<p>As a gamer who is on both PC and console, I can totally understand why most console players are hesitant when advised to build <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-gaming-pc">gaming PCs</a>. Yes, I still think PC is the better platform and there's plenty of freedom to be had with your gaming experience - but if you can't even acquire the right hardware at affordable prices, what choice do you have but to stick with a console?</p><p>Again, you may end up building your desired gaming PC and then still be met with frustrating performance problems. While performance may not be as good on console, it's a manageable experience with stable frame rates that come without the need to tinker or mess around with settings.</p><p>I believe it's a big part of why handheld gaming options like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> are so popular: gamers can simply select a game they want to play (with the help of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified" target="_blank">Deck Verified</a>) and dive in. It's not like that isn't the case on Windows PCs, but it's annoying dealing with regular performance drops due to bad optimization, along with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/windows/windows-11-24h2-is-in-danger-of-becoming-hated-by-gamers">Windows 11 and its game incompatibility problems</a>.</p><p>Gamers just want to be able to purchase the right hardware and get their money's worth while gaming - and if PCs can't provide that right now because of GPU price inflation, then I can't blame anyone for sticking with a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Benchmarks for the Pixel 9a have appeared online</strong></li><li><strong>Some – but not all – of the scores match the Pixel 9</strong></li><li><strong>The handset could be launching sometime this month</strong></li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If the rumors we've heard so far turn out to be accurate, we could be seeing the official launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-9a">Google Pixel 9a</a> as early as next week – and fresh benchmarks that have appeared online give us some idea of the kind of performance we can expect from it.</p><p>These benchmarks come from tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/KaroulSahil/status/1900783842492907703" target="_blank">@KaroulSahil</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Google-Pixel-9a-outperforms-the-Samsung-Galaxy-A56-in-hands-on-benchmark-runs-ahead-of-launch.979740.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>), and are presumably from a device that's being tested somewhere, ahead of the full reveal. The stats include an AnTuTu score of 1,049,844, and Geekbench scores of 1,530 (single-core) and 3,344 (multi-core).</p><p>While that AnTuTu score is along the same lines as the existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> phones – which you would expect, given that the Pixel 9a is predicted to be running the same Tensor G4 processor inside – the Geekbench scores are some way short of the flagship phones that Google unveiled last August.</p><p>There could be a few reasons for this, with the primary one most likely to be that this is a Pixel 9a running pre-launch software that hasn't been properly optimized yet. There might be a few hardware tweaks that still need to be made too.</p>
<h2 id="the-price-is-right-2">The price is right?</h2>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Pixel 9a Benchmark result#Google #GooglePixel9a pic.twitter.com/3lZBobYt6g<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1900783842492907703">March 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Given the history of this mid-range phone series – see our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a review</a>, for example – it's unlikely that we're going to be too surprised by what the Pixel 9a has to offer in terms of performance, when it finally shows up.</p><p>Typically with these phones, the internal specs have been comparable to the flagship models that came before them, while cost savings have been made in the design and materials. That makes them a more affordable choice if you don't want the most expensive Pixel phones Google has to offer.</p><p>As always, pricing is going to be crucial. The Pixel 8a launched for a starting price of $499 / £499 / AU$849, and it looks as though the 128GB model of the Google Pixel 9a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-9a-price-details-just-leaked-online-and-theres-good-and-bad-news">is going to match that</a>. However, we have also heard that the variant with 256GB of storage is going to cost a little more than its predecessor.</p><p>It seems there's a surprising design decision on the way that we're going to have to come to terms with: Google is apparently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/a-convincing-google-pixel-9a-hands-on-video-has-mysteriously-disappeared-but-i-think-it-couldve-been-the-real-thing">getting rid of the classic Pixel camera bump</a>, so it will have a flatter back than the phones that came before it.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Benchmarks for the Pixel 9a have appeared online</strong></li><li><strong>Some – but not all – of the scores match the Pixel 9</strong></li><li><strong>The handset could be launching sometime this month</strong></li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If the rumors we've heard so far turn out to be accurate, we could be seeing the official launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-9a">Google Pixel 9a</a> as early as next week – and fresh benchmarks that have appeared online give us some idea of the kind of performance we can expect from it.</p><p>These benchmarks come from tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/KaroulSahil/status/1900783842492907703" target="_blank">@KaroulSahil</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Google-Pixel-9a-outperforms-the-Samsung-Galaxy-A56-in-hands-on-benchmark-runs-ahead-of-launch.979740.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>), and are presumably from a device that's being tested somewhere, ahead of the full reveal. The stats include an AnTuTu score of 1,049,844, and Geekbench scores of 1,530 (single-core) and 3,344 (multi-core).</p><p>While that AnTuTu score is along the same lines as the existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> phones – which you would expect, given that the Pixel 9a is predicted to be running the same Tensor G4 processor inside – the Geekbench scores are some way short of the flagship phones that Google unveiled last August.</p><p>There could be a few reasons for this, with the primary one most likely to be that this is a Pixel 9a running pre-launch software that hasn't been properly optimized yet. There might be a few hardware tweaks that still need to be made too.</p>
<h2 id="the-price-is-right-6">The price is right?</h2>

<p>Given the history of this mid-range phone series – see our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a review</a>, for example – it's unlikely that we're going to be too surprised by what the Pixel 9a has to offer in terms of performance, when it finally shows up.</p><p>Typically with these phones, the internal specs have been comparable to the flagship models that came before them, while cost savings have been made in the design and materials. That makes them a more affordable choice if you don't want the most expensive Pixel phones Google has to offer.</p><p>As always, pricing is going to be crucial. The Pixel 8a launched for a starting price of $499 / £499 / AU$849, and it looks as though the 128GB model of the Google Pixel 9a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-9a-price-details-just-leaked-online-and-theres-good-and-bad-news">is going to match that</a>. However, we have also heard that the variant with 256GB of storage is going to cost a little more than its predecessor.</p><p>It seems there's a surprising design decision on the way that we're going to have to come to terms with: Google is apparently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/a-convincing-google-pixel-9a-hands-on-video-has-mysteriously-disappeared-but-i-think-it-couldve-been-the-real-thing">getting rid of the classic Pixel camera bump</a>, so it will have a flatter back than the phones that came before it.</p>

<p>The answers to today's Connections, game #645, are…</p>
<ul><li><strong>YELLOW: FILAMENT </strong>FIBER, STRAND, STRING, THREAD</li><li><strong>GREEN: UNINHIBITEDNESS </strong>ABANDON, FREEDOM, SPONTANEITY, UNRESTRAINT</li><li><strong>BLUE: KINDS OF TRUCKS </strong>DUMP, GARBAGE, MONSTER, PICKUP</li><li><strong>PURPLE: BANDS MINUS THE NUMBER FIVE</strong> BEN FOLDS, JACKSON, MAROON, MC</li></ul>
<hr>
<ul><li><strong>My rating:</strong> Easy</li><li><strong>My score: </strong>Perfect</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Seeing the name BEN FOLDS in Connections was a nice buzz – a good human, excellent songwriter, and of course forever associated with the number five, making BANDS MINUS THE NUMBER FIVE the most gettable purple group (for me at least) for a month. JACKSON and MAROON were also easy to find, but I took a guess on MC before remembering that they’re a heavy rock band.</p><p>Here’s a good game to play if you’re bored and with a friend – take it in turns to name artists with numbers in their names and see how far you can count. If you forget 15 and 18 you should be able to get to Matchbox 20.</p><p>Meanwhile, seeing MONSTER and PICKUP in close proximity made the Green group equally easy and it probably says a lot about my own lack of SPONTANEITY that I got UNINHIBITEDNESS last.</p><p>How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below.</p>

<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is NYT Connections?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult.</p><p>On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room.</p><p>It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers.</p><p>It's playable for free via the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands" target="_blank">NYT Games site</a> on desktop or mobile.</p></article></section>

<p>The answers to today's Connections, game #645, are…</p>
<ul><li><strong>YELLOW: FILAMENT </strong>FIBER, STRAND, STRING, THREAD</li><li><strong>GREEN: UNINHIBITEDNESS </strong>ABANDON, FREEDOM, SPONTANEITY, UNRESTRAINT</li><li><strong>BLUE: KINDS OF TRUCKS </strong>DUMP, GARBAGE, MONSTER, PICKUP</li><li><strong>PURPLE: BANDS MINUS THE NUMBER FIVE</strong> BEN FOLDS, JACKSON, MAROON, MC</li></ul>
<hr>
<ul><li><strong>My rating:</strong> Easy</li><li><strong>My score: </strong>Perfect</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Seeing the name BEN FOLDS in Connections was a nice buzz – a good human, excellent songwriter, and of course forever associated with the number five, making BANDS MINUS THE NUMBER FIVE the most gettable purple group (for me at least) for a month. JACKSON and MAROON were also easy to find, but I took a guess on MC before remembering that they’re a heavy rock band.</p><p>Here’s a good game to play if you’re bored and with a friend – take it in turns to name artists with numbers in their names and see how far you can count. If you forget 15 and 18 you should be able to get to Matchbox 20.</p><p>Meanwhile, seeing MONSTER and PICKUP in close proximity made the Green group equally easy and it probably says a lot about my own lack of SPONTANEITY that I got UNINHIBITEDNESS last.</p><p>How did you do today?

<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is NYT Connections?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult.</p><p>On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room.</p><p>It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers.</p><p>It's playable for free via the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands" target="_blank">NYT Games site</a> on desktop or mobile.</p></article></section>

<p>Each night my trusty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/garmin-fenix-7">Garmin Fenix 7</a> tracks my sleep stages based on my heart rate and movement, and it can be set to wake me with an audible or vibrating alarm, so far the two have never been combined. It seems like a no-brainer, but it's something that's still missing from even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/garmin-watch">best Garmin watches.</a></p><p>I'm not the only Garmin user who'd love to be woken more naturally during a period of light sleep. It's a subject that comes up regularly on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/outdoor-recreation/outdoor-recreation/f/fenix-7-series/352090/feature-request-smart-wake-up-alarm" target="_blank">Garmin's support forums</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/17h50lv/why_cant_garmin_introduce_a_smart_alarm/" target="_blank">the Garmin Subreddit</a>.</p>

<p>I could just break away from Garmin entirely, but it would be a wrench. There's years of health and fitness data attached to my Garmin profile – not to mention all those hard-earned virtual badges. I'm halfway up Mt Everest and only 3% off completing the Appalachian Trail badge.</p><p>I'd hoped that smart alarms might be introduced along with the three sleep badges last year (Sleep Savant, Sleep Sleep, and Mythical Sleep –  none of which I've managed to earn) but sadly not.</p><p>For now, I can only wait and hope that smart alarms are one of the features that comes to the latest batch of watches over the coming months. Who knows, if it's limited to the latest devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/garmin-instinct-3-review">Garmin Instinct 3</a>, it might even be enough to convince me to upgrade.</p>

<p>Each night my trusty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/garmin-fenix-7">Garmin Fenix 7</a> tracks my sleep stages based on my heart rate and movement, and it can be set to wake me with an audible or vibrating alarm, so far the two have never been combined. It seems like a no-brainer, but it's something that's still missing from even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/garmin-watch">best Garmin watches.</a></p><p>I'm not the only Garmin user who'd love to be woken more naturally during a period of light sleep. It's a subject that comes up regularly on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/outdoor-recreation/outdoor-recreation/f/fenix-7-series/352090/feature-request-smart-wake-up-alarm" target="_blank">Garmin's support forums</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/17h50lv/why_cant_garmin_introduce_a_smart_alarm/" target="_blank">the Garmin Subreddit</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/17h50lv/why_cant_garmin_introduce_a_smart_alarm">Why can’t garmin introduce a smart alarm?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin">r/Garmin</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>I could just break away from Garmin entirely, but it would be a wrench. There's years of health and fitness data attached to my Garmin profile – not to mention all those hard-earned virtual badges. I'm halfway up Mt Everest and only 3% off completing the Appalachian Trail badge.</p><p>I'd hoped that smart alarms might be introduced along with the three sleep badges last year (Sleep Savant, Sleep Sleep, and Mythical Sleep –  none of which I've managed to earn) but sadly not.</p><p>For now, I can only wait and hope that smart alarms are one of the features that comes to the latest batch of watches over the coming months. Who knows, if it's limited to the latest devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/garmin-instinct-3-review">Garmin Instinct 3</a>, it might even be enough to convince me to upgrade.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Asus is making a Fragrance Mouse with an essential oil compartment</strong></li><li><strong>No pricing has been announced, but it’s expected in April or May</strong></li><li><strong>Asus last year announced a laptop with a scent dispenser</strong></li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you’ve ever wanted to improve the aroma of your workspace, Asus could have the answer: it’s working on a wireless computer mouse with a refillable fragrance compartment.</p><p>The idea is that you’ll fill the perfumed peripheral with an aromatherapy oil of your choice. As you use the mouse, it will passively scent your desktop.</p><p>Not an early April Fools’ joke – in fact, it's really quite a genius idea – the MD101 is very real and very much in development. Asus hasn’t confirmed pricing or a release date, but a company spokesperson has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617917/asus-fragrance-mouse-essential-oils-vial-wireless-dongle-bluetooth" target="_blank">quoted by The Verge</a> as saying that the mouse will hit US shelves in “late April, early May.”</p><p>It follows last year’s announcement of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/laptops/ever-wanted-your-laptop-to-smell-of-basil-and-mandarin-your-fragrant-dreams-can-come-true-with-the-asus-adol-books-built-in-scent-dispenser">Asus Adol Book 14</a>, a laptop with a built-in fragrance dispenser. Whether other Asus product lines are due to receive a scented upgrade remains to be seen, the company did also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/monitors/asus-might-have-just-changed-the-display-game-for-good-with-three-new-air-purifying-monitors-and-one-of-them-is-ultrawide">recently announce three new air-purifying monitors</a> – so it's very much into the idea of melding homeware with computing tech. And we reckon it's onto something.</p>
<h2 id="the-scent-of-a-good-idea-2">The scent of a good idea</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GdFsZMgWhtgSJy7jtjHbUd" name="AsusFragranceMouse-2" alt="Two examples of the Asus Fragrance Mouse sitting on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GdFsZMgWhtgSJy7jtjHbUd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Asus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When choosing one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/peripherals/what-mouse-10-best-mice-compared-1027809">best computer mice</a>, most users go for physical ergonomics over the smell of a given model. Yet there could be an argument for scented accessories.</p><p>While oils can naturally give your workspace a nicer aroma, they could also have soothing benefits for different health conditions. Many people find aromatherapy oils soothing for headaches and stress, for example.</p><p>There’s an argument, then, that the olfactory characteristics of accessories do have a role to play in making workspaces more ergonomic. That certainly seems to be what Asus is suggesting with the MD101. How many people will buy into that thinking is another matter.</p><p>It’s worth noting that 100% pure essential oils can’t be used with the Fragrance Mouse. In the small (smell?) print of the product listing, Asus instructs users to only fill the vial with “essential oils for reed diffusers, ultrasonic diffusers, and aroma stones.” While that means you can’t mix up your own blend of pure essential oils, it still gives you plenty of scents to choose from.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1958px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="fwHdqbfG6urxuQ8PaLpoTd" name="AsusFragranceMouse-3" alt="The underside of the Asus Fragrance Mouse on a blue background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fwHdqbfG6urxuQ8PaLpoTd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1958" height="1101" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Asus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike powered diffusers, it seems the MD101 won’t actively distribute whatever oil you choose to fill it with. Instead, it appears to be a passive diffuser. While this approach will be beneficial for battery life, only real-world testing will determine how effective the mouse actually is at scenting an area.</p><p>Besides the refillable vial, the Fragrance Mouse MD101 is otherwise a pretty standard wireless mouse. Available in Iridescent White or Rose Clay finishes, it can connect to Windows, macOS and Chromebook devices via Bluetooth or 2.4 GHz wireless. DPI is adjustable up to 2400, while PTFE feet promise to glide easy on different surfaces.</p><p>A single AA battery is expected to deliver up to a year of usage, although that may vary depending on how much you make use of the MD101’s “delicate underglow lighting”. Together with the fragrance compartment, Asus reckons it will add “a dash of elegance” to your work surface.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Asus is making a Fragrance Mouse with an essential oil compartment</strong></li><li><strong>No pricing has been announced, but it’s expected in April or May</strong></li><li><strong>Asus last year announced a laptop with a scent dispenser</strong></li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you’ve ever wanted to improve the aroma of your workspace, Asus could have the answer: it’s working on a wireless computer mouse with a refillable fragrance compartment.</p><p>The idea is that you’ll fill the perfumed peripheral with an aromatherapy oil of your choice. As you use the mouse, it will passively scent your desktop.</p><p>Not an early April Fools’ joke – in fact, it's really quite a genius idea – the MD101 is very real and very much in development. Asus hasn’t confirmed pricing or a release date, but a company spokesperson has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617917/asus-fragrance-mouse-essential-oils-vial-wireless-dongle-bluetooth" target="_blank">quoted by The Verge</a> as saying that the mouse will hit US shelves in “late April, early May.”</p><p>It follows last year’s announcement of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/laptops/ever-wanted-your-laptop-to-smell-of-basil-and-mandarin-your-fragrant-dreams-can-come-true-with-the-asus-adol-books-built-in-scent-dispenser">Asus Adol Book 14</a>, a laptop with a built-in fragrance dispenser. Whether other Asus product lines are due to receive a scented upgrade remains to be seen, the company did also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/monitors/asus-might-have-just-changed-the-display-game-for-good-with-three-new-air-purifying-monitors-and-one-of-them-is-ultrawide">recently announce three new air-purifying monitors</a> – so it's very much into the idea of melding homeware with computing tech. And we reckon it's onto something.</p>
<h2 id="the-scent-of-a-good-idea-6">The scent of a good idea</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GdFsZMgWhtgSJy7jtjHbUd" name="AsusFragranceMouse-2" alt="Two examples of the Asus Fragrance Mouse sitting on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GdFsZMgWhtgSJy7jtjHbUd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Asus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When choosing one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/peripherals/what-mouse-10-best-mice-compared-1027809">best computer mice</a>, most users go for physical ergonomics over the smell of a given model. Yet there could be an argument for scented accessories.</p><p>While oils can naturally give your workspace a nicer aroma, they could also have soothing benefits for different health conditions. Many people find aromatherapy oils soothing for headaches and stress, for example.</p><p>There’s an argument, then, that the olfactory characteristics of accessories do have a role to play in making workspaces more ergonomic. That certainly seems to be what Asus is suggesting with the MD101. How many people will buy into that thinking is another matter.</p><p>It’s worth noting that 100% pure essential oils can’t be used with the Fragrance Mouse. In the small (smell?) print of the product listing, Asus instructs users to only fill the vial with “essential oils for reed diffusers, ultrasonic diffusers, and aroma stones.” While that means you can’t mix up your own blend of pure essential oils, it still gives you plenty of scents to choose from.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1958px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="fwHdqbfG6urxuQ8PaLpoTd" name="AsusFragranceMouse-3" alt="The underside of the Asus Fragrance Mouse on a blue background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fwHdqbfG6urxuQ8PaLpoTd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1958" height="1101" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Asus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike powered diffusers, it seems the MD101 won’t actively distribute whatever oil you choose to fill it with. Instead, it appears to be a passive diffuser. While this approach will be beneficial for battery life, only real-world testing will determine how effective the mouse actually is at scenting an area.</p><p>Besides the refillable vial, the Fragrance Mouse MD101 is otherwise a pretty standard wireless mouse. Available in Iridescent White or Rose Clay finishes, it can connect to Windows, macOS and Chromebook devices via Bluetooth or 2.4 GHz wireless. DPI is adjustable up to 2400, while PTFE feet promise to glide easy on different surfaces.</p><p>A single AA battery is expected to deliver up to a year of usage, although that may vary depending on how much you make use of the MD101’s “delicate underglow lighting”. Together with the fragrance compartment, Asus reckons it will add “a dash of elegance” to your work surface.</p>

<p>This is not to be considered a full review – you'll note the lack of a star-rating at the top of this missive. But you should note that I have tested many, many in-ear monitors over the years (including most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/headphones/earbuds-airpods/best-wired-earbuds">best wired earbuds</a> on the market), and listening to Nine Inch Nails with Campfire-and-Cortini's Clara was a rare joy indeed.</p><p>My listening session included reference Flac files stored on my trusty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/portable-media-players/fiio-m23-portable-music-player-review-delicate-yet-muscular-assertive-yet-subtle-lavishly-detailed-and-vaultingly-dynamic">FiiO M23</a>; downloaded Apple Music tracks on my lowly old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-12-pro-review">iPhone 12 Pro</a> via the superb <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/hi-fi/ifi-hip-dac-3-review">iFi hip dac 3 </a>(this CA x AC collab arrives with a USB-C to Lightning adapter and a Pilot 3.5mm to USB-C DAC/dongle, plus Campfire's 3.5mm and 4.4mm 'Time Stream Duet' cables, so practically all portable sources are on the menu), and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/hi-fi/astell-and-kern-hc4-review">Astell & Kern HC4</a> to my MacBook Pro, streaming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/tidal">Tidal</a>'s hi-res output.</p><p>All I ask is that if you're using your smartphone as a source, please, please hardwire these in-ears to a good digital-to-analog-converter – and by that I mean one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/if-iphone-7-ditches-the-audio-jack-these-three-dacs-will-keep-the-music-spinning-1321629">best portable DACs</a>. Because given the highest resolution you (and your wallet) can muster, CA's Clara IEMs will have at it, pull it apart, separate it, emphatically <em>not</em> violate or desecrate it, and bring it closer to God.</p><p>Let me be abundantly clear: if you've never heard Nine Inch Nails (or in fact any layered, heavier track) in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/what-is-hi-res-audio-lossless-music-explained-and-how-to-get-it">hi-res audio</a> or on a decent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-mp3-players-techradars-guide-to-the-best-portable-music-players">high-res portable player</a>, and you're a fan, I really hope you get the opportunity to at least try these in-ear monitors.</p>

<h2 id="we-re-in-this-together-2">We're in this together… </h2>
<p>Deep breath everyone: Campfire Audio's Clara IEMs are available now, as I type, priced at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.musicteck.com/products/campfire-audio-clara?srsltid=AfmBOoqEfQGUinp0S04PoDgfLRdEzgLT9O4E__LtgWZbYjS65DRLdoMm" target="_blank">$1,999</a> / <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Campfire-Audio-Alessandro-Clara-High-Performance-Clear/dp/B0DSLJ93RV/ref=asc_df_B0DSLJ93RV?mcid=9b9520e25e4a3b99abe9dd063efce73b&tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=731342355349&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=525112397363490641&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=2826&hvtargid=pla-2398907330770&psc=1&gad_source=1" target="_blank">£1,999</a> (around AU$3,900). So nearly two grand – yes, with a capital G. And I think they're worth every last cent. If you cannot get your head around that right now, it's okay. But I'd like you to try…</p><p>Aside from being some of the most stunning-looking in-ear monitors I've seen in some time – think ice cubes permeated with a deep-blue melancholy – the pre-fitted Comply memory foam tips slip into my ears happily to allow the ergonomic driver housing to hug my concha. The cable also snakes neatly around my auricle as if its sole desire is to be there, and that's highly unusual for my smaller ears. Often, fitting IEMs is an issue for me, the kind of thing I wouldn't do in a rush but worth it once I get it right. That's simply not the case here; these earpieces are spot on.</p><p>I've written countless words on this Portland Oregon IEM maker's output since I became a full-time audio journalist in 2018, (see my considered thoughts on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/opinion/i-tried-dollar3000-luxury-wired-in-ear-monitors-and-now-i-cant-go-back">Trifecta,</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/headphones/campfire-audio-unveils-fathom-wired-earbuds-6-balanced-armature-drivers-4-figure-price-tag">Fathom</a>, excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/campfire-audio-solaris-stellar-horizon">Solaris Stellar Horizon</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/headphones/campfire-audios-stunning-new-wired-earbuds-will-take-your-ears-to-the-moon">Moon Rover</a>) but the Clara have stolen the spot on heavy rotation I'd previously assigned to the Solaris Stellar Horizon. Why? Because for me, Campfire Audio x Alessandro Cortini – specifically Ken Ball on design and production; Cortini on headshell and overall sonic profile – is the perfect drug.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZVj9e6qg229pazxTVnndD5" name="IMG_4707" alt="Campfire Audio Clara held in a hand, or worn by a woman" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZVj9e6qg229pazxTVnndD5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="no-you-can-t-take-it-2">No, you can't take it </h2>
<p>I cue up <em>Head Like a Hole, </em>because if you can convince me Cortini did anything other than tune Clara using tracks on which he's played synth, guitars, keys and bass live, I'll give up (and perhaps head into the void). The percussion, drum kicks and samples over in my right ear reveal themselves like sonic artifacts in cut-glass jars, each ready for my approval – but only if I've fully appreciated the previous article, intake of breath, or frequency.</p><p>Even if I didn't know it beforehand, listening to the IEMs Cortini has put his name to emphatically confirms that he'd already mastered various axes before joining NIN in the mid noughties. Cortini never lets anything go awry. Keys are human, brought deftly to the front of my cerebral cortex; guitars remain resolutely held in check but with miles of space to expand; a hardcore industrial inky bass underpins the whole. The band's more ambient or purely instrumental soundscapes (<em>A Warm Place;</em> <em>The Persistence of Loss</em>) call to mind the silky layers one sees in French pastry lamination.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Z2BopTmW8Zc2DYVTTcp8R5" name="IMG_4702" alt="Campfire Audio Clara held in a hand, or worn by a woman" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z2BopTmW8Zc2DYVTTcp8R5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The brooding<em> With Teeth </em>intro slithers from my left to right ear. A guitar arrives somewhere above my left collarbone. It moves to my right ear and ultimately back again, of course. It always does. But this time I hear <em>how slowly </em>it snakes over; I notice an overlap I'd not detected before, as if I've just glanced at it anew.</p><p>I also listened to a treasured Cortini collaboration with Daniel Avery, (one I was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/features/this-60-speaker-system-is-like-dolby-atmos-on-steroids-and-it-blew-my-mind">lucky enough to hear at L-Acoustics in London), <em>Illusion of Time</em></a>, and seldom have I heard a set of in-ears so eager to open out and celebrate the delightfully dark and pensive detail in these tracks. A set of headphones rarely reveals fresh elements within much-thumbed albums for me any more. But it happened here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="z7UroEBTXHzJZjAMLXaY55" name="IMG_4705" alt="Campfire Audio Clara held in a hand, or worn by a woman" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z7UroEBTXHzJZjAMLXaY55.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What else should you know? The cable is flat in design, noise-free, and certainly will not tangle. Oh, the accessories! Yes, there's plenty to get through. You get a hard case, a folding leather pouch with a carabiner to clip it to things (it's marginally smaller than the one I got with the Solaris Stellar Horizon, but still), a mesh zipper bag, and<em> </em>a<em> </em>two-pocket IEM pouch for just the headshells. Then, there's a microfiber cleaning cloth, assorted eartips (foam, silicone, Final Type-E) and a little IEM cleaning tool.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rwKBe2k2SpLdYbS2DKfna5" name="IMG_4703" alt="Campfire Audio Clara held in a hand, or worn by a woman" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rwKBe2k2SpLdYbS2DKfna5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Underneath it all is the latest version of Campfire’s dual-magnet dynamic driver, an advanced dual-diaphragm balanced armature driver for mids, and Campfire’s signature dual super-tweeters with proprietary Tuned Acoustic Expansion Chamber (TAEC) tech. And I have no complaints about their integration.</p><p>In fact, I've yet to detect a significant flaw in the dynamic rise and fall, healthy low end, sparkling treble or stone-cold sonic precision that Campfire Audio and Cortini have achieved here for the money. You could even say that when Campfire agreed to send me a set, I had to try… and I came back haunted.</p>

But you should note that I have tested many, many in-ear monitors over the years (including most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/headphones/earbuds-airpods/best-wired-earbuds">best wired earbuds</a> on the market), and listening to Nine Inch Nails with Campfire-and-Cortini's Clara was a rare joy indeed.</p><p>My listening session included reference Flac files stored on my trusty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/portable-media-players/fiio-m23-portable-music-player-review-delicate-yet-muscular-assertive-yet-subtle-lavishly-detailed-and-vaultingly-dynamic">FiiO M23</a>; downloaded Apple Music tracks on my lowly old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-12-pro-review">iPhone 12 Pro</a> via the superb <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/hi-fi/ifi-hip-dac-3-review">iFi hip dac 3 </a>(this CA x AC collab arrives with a USB-C to Lightning adapter and a Pilot 3.5mm to USB-C DAC/dongle, plus Campfire's 3.5mm and 4.4mm 'Time Stream Duet' cables, so practically all portable sources are on the menu), and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/hi-fi/astell-and-kern-hc4-review">Astell & Kern HC4</a> to my MacBook Pro, streaming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/tidal">Tidal</a>'s hi-res output.</p><p>All I ask is that if you're using your smartphone as a source, please, please hardwire these in-ears to a good digital-to-analog-converter – and by that I mean one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/if-iphone-7-ditches-the-audio-jack-these-three-dacs-will-keep-the-music-spinning-1321629">best portable DACs</a>. Because given the highest resolution you (and your wallet) can muster, CA's Clara IEMs will have at it, pull it apart, separate it, emphatically <em>not</em> violate or desecrate it, and bring it closer to God.</p><p>Let me be abundantly clear: if you've never heard Nine Inch Nails (or in fact any layered, heavier track) in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/what-is-hi-res-audio-lossless-music-explained-and-how-to-get-it">hi-res audio</a> or on a decent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-mp3-players-techradars-guide-to-the-best-portable-music-players">high-res portable player</a>, and you're a fan, I really hope you get the opportunity to at least try these in-ear monitors.</p>

<h2 id="we-re-in-this-together-6">We're in this together… </h2>
<p>Deep breath everyone: Campfire Audio's Clara IEMs are available now, as I type, priced at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.musicteck.com/products/campfire-audio-clara?srsltid=AfmBOoqEfQGUinp0S04PoDgfLRdEzgLT9O4E__LtgWZbYjS65DRLdoMm" target="_blank">$1,999</a> / <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Campfire-Audio-Alessandro-Clara-High-Performance-Clear/dp/B0DSLJ93RV/ref=asc_df_B0DSLJ93RV?mcid=9b9520e25e4a3b99abe9dd063efce73b&tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=731342355349&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=525112397363490641&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=2826&hvtargid=pla-2398907330770&psc=1&gad_source=1" target="_blank">£1,999</a> (around AU$3,900). So nearly two grand – yes, with a capital G. And I think they're worth every last cent. If you cannot get your head around that right now, it's okay. But I'd like you to try…</p><p>Aside from being some of the most stunning-looking in-ear monitors I've seen in some time – think ice cubes permeated with a deep-blue melancholy – the pre-fitted Comply memory foam tips slip into my ears happily to allow the ergonomic driver housing to hug my concha. The cable also snakes neatly around my auricle as if its sole desire is to be there, and that's highly unusual for my smaller ears. Often, fitting IEMs is an issue for me, the kind of thing I wouldn't do in a rush but worth it once I get it right. That's simply not the case here; these earpieces are spot on.</p><p>I've written countless words on this Portland Oregon IEM maker's output since I became a full-time audio journalist in 2018, (see my considered thoughts on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/opinion/i-tried-dollar3000-luxury-wired-in-ear-monitors-and-now-i-cant-go-back">Trifecta,</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/headphones/campfire-audio-unveils-fathom-wired-earbuds-6-balanced-armature-drivers-4-figure-price-tag">Fathom</a>, excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/campfire-audio-solaris-stellar-horizon">Solaris Stellar Horizon</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/headphones/campfire-audios-stunning-new-wired-earbuds-will-take-your-ears-to-the-moon">Moon Rover</a>) but the Clara have stolen the spot on heavy rotation I'd previously assigned to the Solaris Stellar Horizon. Why? Because for me, Campfire Audio x Alessandro Cortini – specifically Ken Ball on design and production; Cortini on headshell and overall sonic profile – is the perfect drug.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZVj9e6qg229pazxTVnndD5" name="IMG_4707" alt="Campfire Audio Clara held in a hand, or worn by a woman" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZVj9e6qg229pazxTVnndD5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="no-you-can-t-take-it-6">No, you can't take it </h2>
<p>I cue up <em>Head Like a Hole, </em>because if you can convince me Cortini did anything other than tune Clara using tracks on which he's played synth, guitars, keys and bass live, I'll give up (and perhaps head into the void). The percussion, drum kicks and samples over in my right ear reveal themselves like sonic artifacts in cut-glass jars, each ready for my approval – but only if I've fully appreciated the previous article, intake of breath, or frequency.</p><p>Even if I didn't know it beforehand, listening to the IEMs Cortini has put his name to emphatically confirms that he'd already mastered various axes before joining NIN in the mid noughties. Cortini never lets anything go awry. Keys are human, brought deftly to the front of my cerebral cortex; guitars remain resolutely held in check but with miles of space to expand; a hardcore industrial inky bass underpins the whole. The band's more ambient or purely instrumental soundscapes (<em>A Warm Place;</em> <em>The Persistence of Loss</em>) call to mind the silky layers one sees in French pastry lamination.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Z2BopTmW8Zc2DYVTTcp8R5" name="IMG_4702" alt="Campfire Audio Clara held in a hand, or worn by a woman" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z2BopTmW8Zc2DYVTTcp8R5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The brooding<em> With Teeth </em>intro slithers from my left to right ear. A guitar arrives somewhere above my left collarbone. It moves to my right ear and ultimately back again, of course. It always does. But this time I hear <em>how slowly </em>it snakes over; I notice an overlap I'd not detected before, as if I've just glanced at it anew.</p><p>I also listened to a treasured Cortini collaboration with Daniel Avery, (one I was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/features/this-60-speaker-system-is-like-dolby-atmos-on-steroids-and-it-blew-my-mind">lucky enough to hear at L-Acoustics in London), <em>Illusion of Time</em></a>, and seldom have I heard a set of in-ears so eager to open out and celebrate the delightfully dark and pensive detail in these tracks. A set of headphones rarely reveals fresh elements within much-thumbed albums for me any more. But it happened here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="z7UroEBTXHzJZjAMLXaY55" name="IMG_4705" alt="Campfire Audio Clara held in a hand, or worn by a woman" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z7UroEBTXHzJZjAMLXaY55.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What else should you know? The cable is flat in design, noise-free, and certainly will not tangle. Oh, the accessories! Yes, there's plenty to get through. You get a hard case, a folding leather pouch with a carabiner to clip it to things (it's marginally smaller than the one I got with the Solaris Stellar Horizon, but still), a mesh zipper bag, and<em> </em>a<em> </em>two-pocket IEM pouch for just the headshells. Then, there's a microfiber cleaning cloth, assorted eartips (foam, silicone, Final Type-E) and a little IEM cleaning tool.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rwKBe2k2SpLdYbS2DKfna5" name="IMG_4703" alt="Campfire Audio Clara held in a hand, or worn by a woman" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rwKBe2k2SpLdYbS2DKfna5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Underneath it all is the latest version of Campfire’s dual-magnet dynamic driver, an advanced dual-diaphragm balanced armature driver for mids, and Campfire’s signature dual super-tweeters with proprietary Tuned Acoustic Expansion Chamber (TAEC) tech. And I have no complaints about their integration.</p><p>In fact, I've yet to detect a significant flaw in the dynamic rise and fall, healthy low end, sparkling treble or stone-cold sonic precision that Campfire Audio and Cortini have achieved here for the money. You could even say that when Campfire agreed to send me a set, I had to try… and I came back haunted.</p>

<p>The following cast list has been officially revealed for <em>Alien: Earth</em>, but most of their roles are being kept under wraps:</p>
<ul><li>Sydney Chandler as Wendy</li><li>Timothy Olyphant as Kirsh</li><li>Alex Lawther as CJ</li><li>Kit Young as Tootles</li><li>Samuel Blenkin as Boy Kavalier</li><li>Essie Davis as Dame Silvia</li><li>Adarsh Gourav as Slightly</li><li>David Rysdahl as TBC</li><li>Babou Ceesay as TBC</li><li>Jonathan Ajayi as TBC</li><li>Erana James as TBC</li><li>Lily Newmark as TBC</li><li>Diêm Camille as TBC</li><li>Adrian Edmondson as TBC</li><li>Moe Bar-El as TBC</li><li>Sandra Yi Sencindiver as TBC</li></ul>

It has also been revealed that she's a meta-human, with the body of an adult, but brain and consciousness of a child. Kirsh (Timothy Olyphant) is Wendy's mentor and Sandra Yi Sencindiver's currently unnamed character holds a high position at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.

<p><strong>Potential spoilers follow for </strong><em><strong>Alien: Earth</strong></em><strong> below.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>We don't know much about <em>Alien: Earth </em>given that its plot has been kept locked up tightly. But what we do know is that it will be set on Earth, no surprises there, in the not-so-distant future. In fact, thanks to the teaser above, it says: "In 2120 Mother Earth is expecting," with the image of Earth a reflection in the Xenomorph's helmet. Visiting our planet is certainly a new direction for the franchise and one that actual acts as a prequel to the original <em>Alien</em> movie, which took place in 2122.</p><p>And then there's the show's official synopsis that expands on this concept: "When a mysterious space vessel crash-lands on Earth, a young woman and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet's greatest threat. In 2120, Mother Earth is expecting."</p><p>Speaking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DEADLINE/status/1835449820087308692" target="_blank">Deadline</a>, Hawley said: "There's something about seeing a Xenomorph in the wilds of Earth with your own eyes that is truly chilling to think of it moving here among us." And when talking about the Xenomorph he's created for <em>Alien: Earth</em>, he added: "What was really fun for me was to be able to engage with the creature and bring some of my own thoughts to its design while not touching the silhouette because that's sacrosanct. But some of the elements of it as we know, whatever the host is, informs what the final creature is."</p><p>As well as the Xenomorphs themselves, we also know that Weyland-Yutani will, once again, play a major part in the franchise. The conglomerate well-known for their controlling grip over space with their own bad intentions with the Xenomorphs rearing its ugly head over the course of the eight movies prior.</p><p>And FX chief John Landgraf was keen to express how <em>Alien: Earth</em> sets itself apart from the rest of the franchise, while still staying true to it. In an interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/fx-alien-tv-series-1235095576/" target="_blank">THR</a>, he explained: "All I can tell you is Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) won't be a part of it, and neither will any other characters - other than the alien itself."</p><p>Adding: "Noah has an incredible ability to both find a way of being faithful and showing fidelity to an original creation, like to the Coen brothers (with <em>Fargo) </em>or to Ridley Scott's movie and Jame's Cameron's follow-up <em>Aliens</em>, but also to bring something new that represents both an extension and reinvention of a franchise at the same time."</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-there-be-more-seasons-of-alien-earth"><span>Will there be more seasons of Alien: Earth?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TahrBRYqvEovdqRfYmSNzE" name="Alien Romulus.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a segment of the Alien: Romulus poster showing a xenomorph looking down at something" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TahrBRYqvEovdqRfYmSNzE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 20th Century Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Considering <em>Alien: Earth</em> season 1 is a little while away still, unsurprisingly news on more seasons is thin on the ground. Though there has been a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://productionbulletin.com/" target="_blank">Production Bulletin</a>, yet unconfirmed but revealed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cbr.com/alien-earth-season-2-already-planned/" target="_blank">Comic Book Resources</a>, that season 2 is planned for development for filming in Thailand.</p><p>And while this news is unconfirmed, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://collider.com/alien-series-multiple-seasons/" target="_blank">Collider</a> also reported in January 2024 that FX has disclosed to Hawley that there was more to come. Hawley said: "I knew that their desire was for a recurring series, not a limited series, and I had an idea that I was excited about, that I could see the escalation of it from one year to another."</p><p>It seems like he's already got an idea of where he'd like to go next too, adding: "that's where we ended up not pitching them having a bible or pitching them blow-by-blow, but saying, "Big picture: this is the first movement, this is the second movement, and we're ultimately going here."</p><p>Of course, it'll depend on viewing figures and how <em>Alien: Earth</em> is received, but joining part of an existing and iconic franchise is a great place to start and one that Hawley, and reportedly FX, are already eager to look into expanding.</p>

<p>The following cast list has been officially revealed for <em>Alien: Earth</em>, but most of their roles are being kept under wraps:</p>
<ul><li>Sydney Chandler as Wendy</li><li>Timothy Olyphant as Kirsh</li><li>Alex Lawther as CJ</li><li>Kit Young as Tootles</li><li>Samuel Blenkin as Boy Kavalier</li><li>Essie Davis as Dame Silvia</li><li>Adarsh Gourav as Slightly</li><li>David Rysdahl as TBC</li><li>Babou Ceesay as TBC</li><li>Jonathan Ajayi as TBC</li><li>Erana James as TBC</li><li>Lily Newmark as TBC</li><li>Diêm Camille as TBC</li><li>Adrian Edmondson as TBC</li><li>Moe Bar-El as TBC</li><li>Sandra Yi Sencindiver as TBC</li></ul>

It has also been revealed that she's a meta-human, with the body of an adult, but brain and consciousness of a child. Kirsh (Timothy Olyphant) is Wendy's mentor and Sandra Yi Sencindiver's currently unnamed character holds a high position at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. It's not a lot to go on, but it's certainly starting to paint a picture.</p>

<p><strong>Potential spoilers follow for </strong><em><strong>Alien: Earth</strong></em><strong> below.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>We don't know much about <em>Alien: Earth </em>given that its plot has been kept locked up tightly. But what we do know is that it will be set on Earth, no surprises there, in the not-so-distant future. In fact, thanks to the teaser above, it says: "In 2120 Mother Earth is expecting," with the image of Earth a reflection in the Xenomorph's helmet. Visiting our planet is certainly a new direction for the franchise and one that actual acts as a prequel to the original <em>Alien</em> movie, which took place in 2122.</p><p>And then there's the show's official synopsis that expands on this concept: "When a mysterious space vessel crash-lands on Earth, a young woman and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet's greatest threat. In 2120, Mother Earth is expecting."</p><p>Speaking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DEADLINE/status/1835449820087308692" target="_blank">Deadline</a>, Hawley said: "There's something about seeing a Xenomorph in the wilds of Earth with your own eyes that is truly chilling to think of it moving here among us." And when talking about the Xenomorph he's created for <em>Alien: Earth</em>, he added: "What was really fun for me was to be able to engage with the creature and bring some of my own thoughts to its design while not touching the silhouette because that's sacrosanct. But some of the elements of it as we know, whatever the host is, informs what the final creature is."</p><p>As well as the Xenomorphs themselves, we also know that Weyland-Yutani will, once again, play a major part in the franchise. The conglomerate well-known for their controlling grip over space with their own bad intentions with the Xenomorphs rearing its ugly head over the course of the eight movies prior.</p><p>And FX chief John Landgraf was keen to express how <em>Alien: Earth</em> sets itself apart from the rest of the franchise, while still staying true to it. In an interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/fx-alien-tv-series-1235095576/" target="_blank">THR</a>, he explained: "All I can tell you is Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) won't be a part of it, and neither will any other characters - other than the alien itself."</p><p>Adding: "Noah has an incredible ability to both find a way of being faithful and showing fidelity to an original creation, like to the Coen brothers (with <em>Fargo) </em>or to Ridley Scott's movie and Jame's Cameron's follow-up <em>Aliens</em>, but also to bring something new that represents both an extension and reinvention of a franchise at the same time."</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-there-be-more-seasons-of-alien-earth"><span>Will there be more seasons of Alien: Earth?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TahrBRYqvEovdqRfYmSNzE" name="Alien Romulus.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a segment of the Alien: Romulus poster showing a xenomorph looking down at something" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TahrBRYqvEovdqRfYmSNzE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 20th Century Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Considering <em>Alien: Earth</em> season 1 is a little while away still, unsurprisingly news on more seasons is thin on the ground. Though there has been a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://productionbulletin.com/" target="_blank">Production Bulletin</a>, yet unconfirmed but revealed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cbr.com/alien-earth-season-2-already-planned/" target="_blank">Comic Book Resources</a>, that season 2 is planned for development for filming in Thailand.</p><p>And while this news is unconfirmed, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://collider.com/alien-series-multiple-seasons/" target="_blank">Collider</a> also reported in January 2024 that FX has disclosed to Hawley that there was more to come. Hawley said: "I knew that their desire was for a recurring series, not a limited series, and I had an idea that I was excited about, that I could see the escalation of it from one year to another."</p><p>It seems like he's already got an idea of where he'd like to go next too, adding: "that's where we ended up not pitching them having a bible or pitching them blow-by-blow, but saying, "Big picture: this is the first movement, this is the second movement, and we're ultimately going here."</p><p>Of course, it'll depend on viewing figures and how <em>Alien: Earth</em> is received, but joining part of an existing and iconic franchise is a great place to start and one that Hawley, and reportedly FX, are already eager to look into expanding.</p>

<p>P is a middling end letter in Wordle. It features in 56 answers, which places it 12th in the alphabet. Don't expect it to happen that often compared to the likes of E, Y and T.</p>

<p>Today's Wordle answer (game #1366) is… <strong>STAMP</strong>.</p><p>My approach to Wordle is undeniably nerdy, but relying on probability really does work over a long period. Of course it does – it's mathematics, it <em>has</em> to work!</p><p>Take the first two letters today, ST. These are, statistically, the most common to find together at the start of a solution, a detail I cover in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/websites-apps/i-analyzed-the-first-1000-wordles-to-look-for-patterns-here-s-what-i-found">analysis of every Wordle answer</a>.</p><p>As that shows, there are 65 ST words among the original 2,309 answers, so you'd expect that pattern to show up every 35.5 games, if the universe was playing along nicely. And what do you know? The last ST game was STEEP, game 1,330, so exactly 36 Wordles ago.</p><p>I do love it when things work out exactly as they should do.</p><p>That didn't entirely help me today, admittedly, because my start word was SHELF – which features the second most common opening combo rather than the first. Yes, it did give me a green S, but it still left 141 answers.</p><p>If you began with STARE, on the other hand, you'll have had a lot of work done for you already, because that cut the shortlist to a mere 11. That probably helps explain why today's game has a low average score of 3.6.</p><p>For my second guess, I decided to focus on letters that can follow an S: T, C and N were all good candidates. I needed some vowels, too, so went with ANTIC – a slightly unconventional choice, but it worked well enough in cutting the list down to eight.</p><p>I found six of those eight words: START, STRAY, STRAP, STRAW, SMART and STOAT. The two I missed were SQUAT – I <em>always </em>forget to look for SQ words – and STAMP.</p><p>How I managed to overlook STAMP, I do not know. It's such an obvious word, and I had all of the other ST options. But miss it I did.</p><p>Fortunately that didn't come back to haunt me. I worked out that playing WORMY would come the closest to narrowing it down, and indeed it did – leaving just the one answer, STAMP.</p><p>Of course I still hadn't spotted that, so I had a puzzled few seconds while I looked at the green M in bewilderment, then realized my error and took my four.</p><p>How did you do today? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="mailto:marc.mclaren@futurenet.com" target="_blank">Send me an email </a>or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/wordle-today#viafoura-comments">let me know in the comments</a>.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-yesterday-s-wordle-hints-game-1365"><span>Yesterday's Wordle hints (game #1365)</span></h2>
<p>In a different time zone where it's still Saturday? Don't worry – I can give you some clues for Wordle #1365, too.</p>
<ul><li>Wordle yesterday <strong>had vowels in two places</strong>.</li></ul>
<p><em>* Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too). </em></p>
<ul><li>The first letter in yesterday's Wordle answer was <strong>L</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>L is a surprisingly uncommon starting letter in Wordle. Despite being the sixth most common letter overall, it's only ranked 12th at the beginning of a word.</p>
<ul><li>There were <strong>repeated letters</strong> in yesterday's Wordle.</li></ul>
<p>Repeated letters are quite common in the game, with 748 of the 2,309 Wordle answers containing one. However, it's still more likely that a Wordle <em>doesn't</em> have one.</p>
<ul><li>The last letter in yesterday's Wordle was <strong>E</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>E is the most common letter to end a Wordle answer by far. That's one of the reasons why many of the best start words, including SLATE, CRANE, CRATE and STARE, all end with one.</p>
<p>Still looking for more Wordle hints? Here's an extra one for game #1365.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Yesterday's Wordle answer is a kitchen utensil.</strong></li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>NYT average score:</strong> 4.1</li><li><strong>My score:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>WordleBot's score:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>My start word performance:</strong> TRUCK (826 remaining answers)</li><li><strong>WordleBot's start word performance:</strong> CRANE (57)</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Yesterday's Wordle answer (game #1365) was… <strong>LADLE</strong>.</p><p>Another day, another Wordle with a repeated letter. But this is far harder than Friday's PIECE.</p><p>LADLE currently has an average score of 4.1 – making it the equal toughest (with MANGO, NAVEL and GREED) since the March 2 (on the first day of the month we had the horrifically difficult HOVER, with an average of 4.7).</p><p>It certainly caused me some problems, and I had to settle for an unsatisfactory five, just as I did with GREED. The issue here was that I simply didn't think of LADLE as an option until too late.</p><p>And why would I? The LADLE is arguably the least important member of the kitchen utensils drawer, after all. It only gets uses rarely, for soups and casseroles, and the rest of the time just lurks at the back, only popping up when you're searching for a spatula or wooden spoon.</p><p>My start word didn't help, either. I began with TRUCK, which would have been very useful a few days ago when the answer was TRACK, but which today gave me zero letters and left 800+ possible solutions for the third day in a row.</p><p>I followed up with PLANE, and that was a lot better. In fact, it gave me two yellows and a green, and cut the shortlist to 13.</p><p>Well, according to WordleBot. The problem was that my own list contained eight: SALVE, FALSE, VALVE, HALVE, AISLE, AGILE, FABLE and GABLE. The ones I missed were SABLE (unlikely), EAGLE (likely – but it's been a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/past-wordle-answers">past Wordle answer</a>), AMBLE (likely), ADDLE (seems unlikely) and LADLE (which was the answer, of course).</p><p>I based my third guess on my list, and came up with VANGS. I have no idea what that means, but Wordle accepted it, and it did the trick of reducing those 13 words to a pair: FABLE and LADLE.</p><p>Unfortunately, I still hadn't thought of the latter, so played FABLE and was horrified when only three letters turned green.</p><p>At this point I was in a bit of a panic. I had two guesses left and for all I knew there might be dozens more words that fit. But after an exhaustive search I came up with LADLE, and was able to escape with a five.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-wordle"><span>What is Wordle?</span></h3>
<p>If you're on this page then you almost certainly know what Wordle is already, and indeed have probably been playing it for a while. And even if you've not been playing it, you must surely have heard of it by now, because it's the viral word game phenomenon that took the world by storm last year and is still going strong in 2024.</p><p>We've got a full guide to the game in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/wordle">What is Wordle</a> page, but if you just want a refresher then here are the basics.</p>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is Wordle?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Wordle challenges you to guess a new five-letter word each day. You get six guesses, with each one revealing a little more information. If one of the letters in your guess is in the answer and in the right place, it turns green. If it's in the answer but in the wrong place, it turns yellow. And if it's not in the answer at all it turns gray. Simple, eh?</p><p>It's played online via the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Wordle website</strong></a> or the New York Times' Crossword app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/new-york-times-crossword/id307569751" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nytimes.crossword" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Android</a>), and is entirely free. </p><p>Crucially, the answer is the same for everyone each day, meaning that you're competing against the rest of the world, rather than just against yourself or the game. The puzzle then resets each day at midnight in your local time, giving you a new challenge, and the chance to extend your streak.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What are the Wordle rules?</h3><p>The rules of Wordle are pretty straightforward, but with a couple of curveballs thrown in for good measure.</p><article class="article__schema-answer"><p><strong>1.</strong> Letters that are in the answer and in the right place turn green.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Letters that are in the answer but in the wrong place turn yellow.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Letters that are not in the answer turn gray.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Answers are never plural.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Letters can appear more than once. So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Each guess must be a valid word in Wordle's dictionary. You can't guess ABCDE, for instance.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> You do not have to include correct letters in subsequent guesses unless you play on Hard mode.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> You have six guesses to solve the Wordle.</p><p><strong>9.</strong> You must complete the daily Wordle before midnight in your timezone.</p><p><strong>10.</strong> All answers are drawn from Wordle's list of 2,309 solutions. However…</p><p><strong>11.</strong> Wordle will accept a wider pool of words as guesses – some 10,000 of them. For instance, you can guess a plural such as WORDS. It definitely won't be right (see point 4 above), but Wordle will accept it as a guess.</p></article></section>

<hr>
<p>Today's Wordle answer (game #1366) is… <strong>STAMP</strong>.</p><p>My approach to Wordle is undeniably nerdy, but relying on probability really does work over a long period. Of course it does – it's mathematics, it <em>has</em> to work!</p><p>Take the first two letters today, ST. These are, statistically, the most common to find together at the start of a solution, a detail I cover in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/websites-apps/i-analyzed-the-first-1000-wordles-to-look-for-patterns-here-s-what-i-found">analysis of every Wordle answer</a>.</p><p>As that shows, there are 65 ST words among the original 2,309 answers, so you'd expect that pattern to show up every 35.5 games, if the universe was playing along nicely. And what do you know? The last ST game was STEEP, game 1,330, so exactly 36 Wordles ago.</p><p>I do love it when things work out exactly as they should do.</p><p>That didn't entirely help me today, admittedly, because my start word was SHELF – which features the second most common opening combo rather than the first. Yes, it did give me a green S, but it still left 141 answers.</p><p>If you began with STARE, on the other hand, you'll have had a lot of work done for you already, because that cut the shortlist to a mere 11. That probably helps explain why today's game has a low average score of 3.6.</p><p>For my second guess, I decided to focus on letters that can follow an S: T, C and N were all good candidates. I needed some vowels, too, so went with ANTIC – a slightly unconventional choice, but it worked well enough in cutting the list down to eight.</p><p>I found six of those eight words: START, STRAY, STRAP, STRAW, SMART and STOAT. The two I missed were SQUAT – I <em>always </em>forget to look for SQ words – and STAMP.</p><p>How I managed to overlook STAMP, I do not know. It's such an obvious word, and I had all of the other ST options. But miss it I did.</p><p>Fortunately that didn't come back to haunt me. I worked out that playing WORMY would come the closest to narrowing it down, and indeed it did – leaving just the one answer, STAMP.</p><p>Of course I still hadn't spotted that, so I had a puzzled few seconds while I looked at the green M in bewilderment, then realized my error and took my four.</p><p>How did you do today? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="mailto:marc.mclaren@futurenet.com" target="_blank">Send me an email </a>or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/wordle-today#viafoura-comments">let me know in the comments</a>.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-yesterday-s-wordle-hints-game-1365"><span>Yesterday's Wordle hints (game #1365)</span></h2>
<p>In a different time zone where it's still Saturday? Don't worry – I can give you some clues for Wordle #1365, too.</p>
<ul><li>Wordle yesterday <strong>had vowels in two places</strong>.</li></ul>
<p><em>* Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too). </em></p>
<ul><li>The first letter in yesterday's Wordle answer was <strong>L</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>L is a surprisingly uncommon starting letter in Wordle. Despite being the sixth most common letter overall, it's only ranked 12th at the beginning of a word.</p>
<ul><li>There were <strong>repeated letters</strong> in yesterday's Wordle.</li></ul>
<p>Repeated letters are quite common in the game, with 748 of the 2,309 Wordle answers containing one. However, it's still more likely that a Wordle <em>doesn't</em> have one.</p>
<ul><li>The last letter in yesterday's Wordle was <strong>E</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>E is the most common letter to end a Wordle answer by far. That's one of the reasons why many of the best start words, including SLATE, CRANE, CRATE and STARE, all end with one.</p>

<hr>
<p>Yesterday's Wordle answer (game #1365) was… <strong>LADLE</strong>.</p><p>Another day, another Wordle with a repeated letter. But this is far harder than Friday's PIECE.</p><p>LADLE currently has an average score of 4.1 – making it the equal toughest (with MANGO, NAVEL and GREED) since the March 2 (on the first day of the month we had the horrifically difficult HOVER, with an average of 4.7).</p><p>It certainly caused me some problems, and I had to settle for an unsatisfactory five, just as I did with GREED. The issue here was that I simply didn't think of LADLE as an option until too late.</p><p>And why would I? The LADLE is arguably the least important member of the kitchen utensils drawer, after all. It only gets uses rarely, for soups and casseroles, and the rest of the time just lurks at the back, only popping up when you're searching for a spatula or wooden spoon.</p><p>My start word didn't help, either. I began with TRUCK, which would have been very useful a few days ago when the answer was TRACK, but which today gave me zero letters and left 800+ possible solutions for the third day in a row.</p><p>I followed up with PLANE, and that was a lot better. In fact, it gave me two yellows and a green, and cut the shortlist to 13.</p><p>Well, according to WordleBot. The problem was that my own list contained eight: SALVE, FALSE, VALVE, HALVE, AISLE, AGILE, FABLE and GABLE. The ones I missed were SABLE (unlikely), EAGLE (likely – but it's been a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/past-wordle-answers">past Wordle answer</a>), AMBLE (likely), ADDLE (seems unlikely) and LADLE (which was the answer, of course).</p><p>I based my third guess on my list, and came up with VANGS. I have no idea what that means, but Wordle accepted it, and it did the trick of reducing those 13 words to a pair: FABLE and LADLE.</p><p>Unfortunately, I still hadn't thought of the latter, so played FABLE and was horrified when only three letters turned green.</p><p>At this point I was in a bit of a panic. I had two guesses left and for all I knew there might be dozens more words that fit. But after an exhaustive search I came up with LADLE, and was able to escape with a five.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-wordle"><span>What is Wordle?</span></h3>
<p>If you're on this page then you almost certainly know what Wordle is already, and indeed have probably been playing it for a while. And even if you've not been playing it, you must surely have heard of it by now, because it's the viral word game phenomenon that took the world by storm last year and is still going strong in 2024.</p><p>We've got a full guide to the game in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/wordle">What is Wordle</a> page, but if you just want a refresher then here are the basics.</p>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is Wordle?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Wordle challenges you to guess a new five-letter word each day. You get six guesses, with each one revealing a little more information. If one of the letters in your guess is in the answer and in the right place, it turns green. If it's in the answer but in the wrong place, it turns yellow. And if it's not in the answer at all it turns gray. Simple, eh?</p><p>It's played online via the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Wordle website</strong></a> or the New York Times' Crossword app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/new-york-times-crossword/id307569751" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nytimes.crossword" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Android</a>), and is entirely free. </p><p>Crucially, the answer is the same for everyone each day, meaning that you're competing against the rest of the world, rather than just against yourself or the game. The puzzle then resets each day at midnight in your local time, giving you a new challenge, and the chance to extend your streak.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What are the Wordle rules?</h3><p>The rules of Wordle are pretty straightforward, but with a couple of curveballs thrown in for good measure.</p><article class="article__schema-answer"><p><strong>1.</strong> Letters that are in the answer and in the right place turn green.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Letters that are in the answer but in the wrong place turn yellow.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Letters that are not in the answer turn gray.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Answers are never plural.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Letters can appear more than once. So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Each guess must be a valid word in Wordle's dictionary. You can't guess ABCDE, for instance.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> You do not have to include correct letters in subsequent guesses unless you play on Hard mode.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> You have six guesses to solve the Wordle.</p><p><strong>9.</strong> You must complete the daily Wordle before midnight in your timezone.</p><p><strong>10.</strong> All answers are drawn from Wordle's list of 2,309 solutions. However…</p><p><strong>11.</strong> Wordle will accept a wider pool of words as guesses – some 10,000 of them. For instance, you can guess a plural such as WORDS. It definitely won't be right (see point 4 above), but Wordle will accept it as a guess.</p></article></section>

<p>Dearest readers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/tag/bridgerton"><em>Bridgerton</em></a> season 4 is in the midst of filming and there's lots of talk about as we approach this new 'Season of Love'. The popular Netflix romantic drama series' next chapter has, as of September 2024, entered full production – and, we wait impatiently for the forthcoming season's pairing of Benedict Bridgerton and his new love interest, Sophie Baek. A prospect that seems quite bewildering given how season 3 left Benedict's relationship status as most definitely single.</p><p>Unfortunately, in lieu of Lady Whistledown’s gossip papers, we've done the digging ourselves around the whispers of the ton and what's next for its captivating characters. So, as we await <em>Bridgerton</em>'s return on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/best-tv-streaming-service-cord-cutting-compare">best streaming service</a>, we've found plenty to talk about when it comes to release date speculation, confirmed new and returning cast, potential story threads, behind-the-scenes footage, and more. <strong>Full spoilers follow </strong>for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/bridgerton-season-3-is-off-to-a-royally-good-start-on-netflix-as-its-forthcoming-prime-video-rival-gets-raunchy-first-trailer"><em>Bridgerton</em> season 3</a> and the previous seasons. <strong>Potential spoilers for </strong><em><strong>Bridgerton</strong></em><strong> season 4 </strong>will also appear.</p>

<p>During the <em>Bridgerton</em> Virtual Fan Event, aptly hosted on Valentine's Day (in true 'Season of Love' fashion), an official behind-the-scenes look was released for <em>Bridgerton</em> season 4.

<p>A brief <em>Bridgerton</em> season 4 teaser, which arrived in July 2024, also previously acted as the confirmation that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/netflix/netflixs-bridgerton-season-4-announcement-gives-us-a-sneak-peek-of-the-shows-new-romantic-lead">season 4’s romantic lead will be Benedict Bridgerton</a>.</p><p>Seen amongst clips of past seasons, the text "Welcome to the marriage mart, Benedict," appears on the screen. Following the montage, we’re treated to behind-the-scenes footage of a person off-screen saying "I hear we’re fitting you for a suit",  to which Benedict aka Luke Thompson replies "I already have an outfit for tonight." The person off-screen responds "Oh no, it’s not for tonight. It’s for the masquerade ball", before Benedict says "In that case, come on in."</p><p>The masquerade ball, according to Julia Quinn’s novels, is where Benedict famously meets Sophie Beckett, aka the ‘Lady in Silver,’ but we’ll dive into this in our plot section.</p>

<p>We know who Benedict Bridgerton is, but who will play the famous Sophie Beckett (or, in Netflix's adaptation, Sophie Baek)? In August, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/bridgerton-season-4-cast-yerin-ha-sophie-1236107871/" target="_blank">Variety</a>'s sources suggested Australian actress Yerin Ha (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/halo"><em>Halo</em></a><em>, Bad Behaviour)</em> had been cast, and Variety's sources proved to be right – Netflix confirming Ha will play Sophie in an X/Twitter post on September 11 2024.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4" target="_blank">Netflix Tudum</a> about what drew her to the role, Ha said: "She immediately has obstacles – something that she constantly has to overcome, whether it’s this battle around social status or trying to hide her feelings from Benedict. When does Sophie put on this mask to cover her emotions? Or vice versa, when does she take it off and when does she soften up? Playing with those [questions] is just really fun."</p><p>But why the surname change? As Ha explains, it's down to her Australian actor's Korean heritage, which showrunner Jess Brownell was also eager to honor as part of Sophie's slightly revised backstory. "A name is the first bit of identity that you share with the world, and that’s why changing a name can be so powerful," Ha said. "To make Sophie’s name fit someone who looks like me is really empowering. All credit to Jess Brownell, our showrunner. It’s a really nice way for me to feel like the role is fit for me, rather than me having to fit a certain mold. It’s amazing what it can do just in a psychological sense. So, it means a lot that Jess did that for me."</p>

<p>Ha's hiring isn't the only one to be announced in September. Five days after Netflix cast its Sophie, the streamer also revealed three more stars who'll appear as prominent characters in season 4: Katie Leung (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techradar.com/tag/arcane"><em>Arcane</em></a>, <em>The Peripheral</em>) as Lady Araminta Gun, Michelle Mao (<em>A Big Bold Beautiful Journey</em>) as Rosamund Li, and Isabella Wei (<em>1899</em>) as Posy Li. And, during the <em>Bridgerton</em> Virtual Fan Event (as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/features/bridgerton-virtual-fan-event-2025" target="_blank">Tudum</a>), it was also revealed that season 2's leading lady Simone Ashley will be returning as Kate Sharma.</p><p>And, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2024/12/bridgerton-season-4-table-read-new-returning-cast-1236242631/" target="_blank">Deadline</a>, Emma Naomi and Hugh Sachs have also been promoted to series regulars for <em>Bridgerton </em>season 4 as Alice Mondrich and Brimsley respectively. Whilst there's plenty of new and returning cast members, there's one character that won't be part of season 4's cast - Daphne Basset (née Bridgerton) played by Phoebe Dynevor. Speaking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thedirect.com/article/bridgerton-season-4-phoebe-dynevor-return-daphne" target="_blank">The Direct</a>, she revealed executives have: "not called [her] yet" and that she's "still waiting for that call."</p>

<p><strong>Full spoilers follow for </strong><em><strong>Bridgerton</strong></em><strong> season 3 and Julia Quinn's 'An Offer From a Gentleman' book, which season 4 is based on.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Bridgerton</em> season 4's story brief hasn't been unveiled yet – and it won't be until closer to its release. Even so, we have some ideas of where the plot will go, based on its source material and how Benedict's story in the third season ended. We also know it will be eight episodes long, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/bridgerton-season-4-cast-release-date-news" target="_blank">Tudum</a>.</p><p>In <em>Bridgerton</em> season 3, the focus was Penelope and Colin, which actually meant the show skipped ahead in Julia Quinn’s book series. As previously mentioned, however, season 3 will leap back a few chapters to book three, which is called 'An Offer From a Gentleman'. Fans of the books will know, then, that it’s time for Benedict the bachelor to meet Sophie Beckett – the elusive Lady in Silver who sneaks into the masquerade ball to find a suitor, stumbles upon him, and likely captures his heart.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Benedict Bridgerton’s Season 4 story? Let us pour some tea…Despite his elder and younger brothers both being happily married, Benedict is loath to settle down -- until he meets a captivating Lady in Silver at his mother's masquerade ball. pic.twitter.com/KmGDp1L5FF<a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1815737070436155492">July 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>In the books, the Lady in Silver is the illegitimate daughter of an Earl and one of his maids, although he hasn’t publicly acknowledged her as his daughter despite her living with him.</p><p>It may be hard to believe Benedict may finally settle down, considering how season 3 ended. Indeed, viewers watched as Benedict embarked on not one, but two relationships; the untethered playboy messing around with Lady Tilley Arnold and Paul Suarez. However, he broke up with the pair in the season 3 finale after he decides he doesn't want to tie himself down to any one person.</p><p>Elaborating on why Benedict made that decision, Luke Thompson, who plays the character, told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/bridgerton-season-4-cast-release-date-news#:~:text=Who%20is%20Bridgerton%20Season%204,is%20loath%20to%20settle%20down.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">Netflix Tudum</a>: "Benedict has always been a little lost – or free, depending on the way you want to look at it. But, now he’s trying to find something a bit more solid in himself. His identity has been a little bit of a question mark, but it doesn’t ever seem to really bother him. It often feels like 'you’re either this, or you’re this'. He’s finding it out."</p>

<p>Showrunner Jess Brownell also spoke to Tudum about Benedict’s love story, adding: "It felt important for him to explore the fullness of himself before he settles down. He is someone who has big appetites, and we wanted to see him living a big life before he goes into settle-down mode."</p><p>Much like <em>Bridgerton’s</em> first three seasons, though, the romantic lead isn’t the only one embarking on a love story, of which there’s most certainly more to explore in season 4. We know that Lady Violet Bridgerton was enjoying the company of Lady Danbury’s brother, Lord Marcus Anderson – and, during the season 3 finale, we saw the pair dance the night away at the Dankworth-Finch ball.</p><p>Kate and Anthony are due to welcome their first child, too, which will see the married couple travel to India to do so. There’s also more to explore from Colin and Penelope as Polin embark on married life and raising their child. Luke Newton spoke to Tudum about their new role, teasing: "Once you’ve had your moment, it’s really nice to see how they’ll navigate married life. It’ll be a place of comfort for them and they’ll enjoy it."</p>

<p>And then there’s Eloise traveling to Scotland alongside her sister Francesca and new husband Lord John Stirling. She decided to pursue her curiosity and take a break from the marriage mart in doing so, so it’ll be interesting to see how she spends her time there.</p><p>It was as much of a cliffhanger ending for the new Stirlings as well, as Francesca met John’s cousin Michaela Stirling. In Quinn's book 'When He Was Wicked', this character is male and goes by the name Michael Stirling, so the role has been gender-swapped for Netflix's adaptation. Michaela’s appearance sent fans wild, and for those who’ve yet to read the book, the significance will become all the more clear as the seasons continue.</p><p>Finally, amongst all the love and marriage, Queen Charlotte made a statement in the season 3 finale of accepting Lady Whistledown, aka Penelope Featherington. Whether the Queen’s favor continues, only time will tell. Though Queen Charlotte actress Golda Rosheuvel did reveal during the <em>Bridgerton</em> Virtual Fan Event that season 4 will also "introduce some of the people who keep the ton's many households up and running." With Brownell speaking about "touchstones from the romance genre - including <em>Cinderella</em> - that resonated in this most recent season."</p>

<p>Netflix hasn't announced if a fifth season will be made. But, according to executive producer Shonda Rhimes, there’s hopefully going to be at least eight. Per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/shonda-rhimes-bridgerton-season-3-delays-penelope-colin-1235991808/" target="_blank">Variety</a>, Rhimes said she still plans to adapt all eight of the <em>Bridgerton</em> books, adding: "I do have a very specific plan of where we go each season – which one is which. Because you really have to start seeding in the other siblings, and what’s going on with them, to push them to the next season. We’ve really talked about it through, I think, season 6 or maybe 7."</p><p>It's unclear if Netflix will take a similar approach to <em>Bridgerton</em> seasons 3 and 4 and renew two more seasons at the same time. Considering how popular <em>Bridgerton</em> continues to be, however, we'd be surprised if it doesn't greenlight the pair, if not a trio of new seasons, before too long.</p><p>As for <em>Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story</em>, Rhimes has teased the possibility of making a second season. "We talk about it a lot," she told Variety. "And, for a while, I was holding it very close, and didn’t necessarily know that I wanted to play it out in a <em>Bridgerton</em> season. But, now we’ve been talking about what it would look like if we saw a little bit in <em>Bridgerton’s </em>present day, with Brimsley and Reynolds, and what that would mean [and] I think it deprives us of a chance to tell the story the way it should be told."</p>

<p>Dearest readers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/tag/bridgerton"><em>Bridgerton</em></a> season 4 is in the midst of filming and there's lots of talk about as we approach this new 'Season of Love'. The popular Netflix romantic drama series' next chapter has, as of September 2024, entered full production – and, we wait impatiently for the forthcoming season's pairing of Benedict Bridgerton and his new love interest, Sophie Baek. A prospect that seems quite bewildering given how season 3 left Benedict's relationship status as most definitely single.</p><p>Unfortunately, in lieu of Lady Whistledown’s gossip papers, we've done the digging ourselves around the whispers of the ton and what's next for its captivating characters. So, as we await <em>Bridgerton</em>'s return on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/best-tv-streaming-service-cord-cutting-compare">best streaming service</a>, we've found plenty to talk about when it comes to release date speculation, confirmed new and returning cast, potential story threads, behind-the-scenes footage, and more. <strong>Full spoilers follow </strong>for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/bridgerton-season-3-is-off-to-a-royally-good-start-on-netflix-as-its-forthcoming-prime-video-rival-gets-raunchy-first-trailer"><em>Bridgerton</em> season 3</a> and the previous seasons. <strong>Potential spoilers for </strong><em><strong>Bridgerton</strong></em><strong> season 4 </strong>will also appear.</p>

<p>We shouldn't expect to see season 4 for two years, then – and that’s been all but confirmed by showrunner Jess Brownell, who told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/bridgerton-season-4-jess-brownell-nicola-coughlan-uk-premiere-1235921379/" target="_blank">The Hollywood Reporter</a> (THR): "We are working to try and put the seasons out more quickly, but they do take eight months to film and then they have to be edited, and then they have to be dubbed into every language.

<p>During the <em>Bridgerton</em> Virtual Fan Event, aptly hosted on Valentine's Day (in true 'Season of Love' fashion), an official behind-the-scenes look was released for <em>Bridgerton</em> season 4. In a flurry of exciting clips, the masquerade ball takes center stage, as does the meet-cute of Sophie Baek and Benedict Bridgerton.

<p>A brief <em>Bridgerton</em> season 4 teaser, which arrived in July 2024, also previously acted as the confirmation that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/netflix/netflixs-bridgerton-season-4-announcement-gives-us-a-sneak-peek-of-the-shows-new-romantic-lead">season 4’s romantic lead will be Benedict Bridgerton</a>.</p><p>Seen amongst clips of past seasons, the text "Welcome to the marriage mart, Benedict," appears on the screen. Following the montage, we’re treated to behind-the-scenes footage of a person off-screen saying "I hear we’re fitting you for a suit",  to which Benedict aka Luke Thompson replies "I already have an outfit for tonight." The person off-screen responds "Oh no, it’s not for tonight. It’s for the masquerade ball", before Benedict says "In that case, come on in."</p><p>The masquerade ball, according to Julia Quinn’s novels, is where Benedict famously meets Sophie Beckett, aka the ‘Lady in Silver,’ but we’ll dive into this in our plot section.</p>

<p>We know who Benedict Bridgerton is, but who will play the famous Sophie Beckett (or, in Netflix's adaptation, Sophie Baek)? In August, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/bridgerton-season-4-cast-yerin-ha-sophie-1236107871/" target="_blank">Variety</a>'s sources suggested Australian actress Yerin Ha (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/halo"><em>Halo</em></a><em>, Bad Behaviour)</em> had been cast, and Variety's sources proved to be right – Netflix confirming Ha will play Sophie in an X/Twitter post on September 11 2024.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4" target="_blank">Netflix Tudum</a> about what drew her to the role, Ha said: "She immediately has obstacles – something that she constantly has to overcome, whether it’s this battle around social status or trying to hide her feelings from Benedict. When does Sophie put on this mask to cover her emotions? Or vice versa, when does she take it off and when does she soften up? Playing with those [questions] is just really fun."</p><p>But why the surname change? As Ha explains, it's down to her Australian actor's Korean heritage, which showrunner Jess Brownell was also eager to honor as part of Sophie's slightly revised backstory. "A name is the first bit of identity that you share with the world, and that’s why changing a name can be so powerful," Ha said. "To make Sophie’s name fit someone who looks like me is really empowering. All credit to Jess Brownell, our showrunner. It’s a really nice way for me to feel like the role is fit for me, rather than me having to fit a certain mold. It’s amazing what it can do just in a psychological sense. So, it means a lot that Jess did that for me."</p>

<p>Ha's hiring isn't the only one to be announced in September. Five days after Netflix cast its Sophie, the streamer also revealed three more stars who'll appear as prominent characters in season 4: Katie Leung (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techradar.com/tag/arcane"><em>Arcane</em></a>, <em>The Peripheral</em>) as Lady Araminta Gun, Michelle Mao (<em>A Big Bold Beautiful Journey</em>) as Rosamund Li, and Isabella Wei (<em>1899</em>) as Posy Li.

Whilst there's plenty of new and returning cast members, there's one character that won't be part of season 4's cast - Daphne Basset (née Bridgerton) played by Phoebe Dynevor. Speaking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thedirect.com/article/bridgerton-season-4-phoebe-dynevor-return-daphne" target="_blank">The Direct</a>, she revealed executives have: "not called [her] yet" and that she's "still waiting for that call."</p>

<p><strong>Full spoilers follow for </strong><em><strong>Bridgerton</strong></em><strong> season 3 and Julia Quinn's 'An Offer From a Gentleman' book, which season 4 is based on.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Bridgerton</em> season 4's story brief hasn't been unveiled yet – and it won't be until closer to its release. Even so, we have some ideas of where the plot will go, based on its source material and how Benedict's story in the third season ended. We also know it will be eight episodes long, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/bridgerton-season-4-cast-release-date-news" target="_blank">Tudum</a>.</p><p>In <em>Bridgerton</em> season 3, the focus was Penelope and Colin, which actually meant the show skipped ahead in Julia Quinn’s book series. As previously mentioned, however, season 3 will leap back a few chapters to book three, which is called 'An Offer From a Gentleman'. Fans of the books will know, then, that it’s time for Benedict the bachelor to meet Sophie Beckett – the elusive Lady in Silver who sneaks into the masquerade ball to find a suitor, stumbles upon him, and likely captures his heart.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Benedict Bridgerton’s Season 4 story? Let us pour some tea…Despite his elder and younger brothers both being happily married, Benedict is loath to settle down -- until he meets a captivating Lady in Silver at his mother's masquerade ball. pic.twitter.com/KmGDp1L5FF<a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1815737070436155492">July 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>In the books, the Lady in Silver is the illegitimate daughter of an Earl and one of his maids, although he hasn’t publicly acknowledged her as his daughter despite her living with him.</p><p>It may be hard to believe Benedict may finally settle down, considering how season 3 ended. Indeed, viewers watched as Benedict embarked on not one, but two relationships; the untethered playboy messing around with Lady Tilley Arnold and Paul Suarez. However, he broke up with the pair in the season 3 finale after he decides he doesn't want to tie himself down to any one person.</p><p>Elaborating on why Benedict made that decision, Luke Thompson, who plays the character, told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/bridgerton-season-4-cast-release-date-news#:~:text=Who%20is%20Bridgerton%20Season%204,is%20loath%20to%20settle%20down.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">Netflix Tudum</a>: "Benedict has always been a little lost – or free, depending on the way you want to look at it. But, now he’s trying to find something a bit more solid in himself. His identity has been a little bit of a question mark, but it doesn’t ever seem to really bother him. It often feels like 'you’re either this, or you’re this'. He’s finding it out."</p>

<p>Showrunner Jess Brownell also spoke to Tudum about Benedict’s love story, adding: "It felt important for him to explore the fullness of himself before he settles down. He is someone who has big appetites, and we wanted to see him living a big life before he goes into settle-down mode."</p><p>Much like <em>Bridgerton’s</em> first three seasons, though, the romantic lead isn’t the only one embarking on a love story, of which there’s most certainly more to explore in season 4. We know that Lady Violet Bridgerton was enjoying the company of Lady Danbury’s brother, Lord Marcus Anderson – and, during the season 3 finale, we saw the pair dance the night away at the Dankworth-Finch ball.</p><p>Kate and Anthony are due to welcome their first child, too, which will see the married couple travel to India to do so. There’s also more to explore from Colin and Penelope as Polin embark on married life and raising their child. Luke Newton spoke to Tudum about their new role, teasing: "Once you’ve had your moment, it’s really nice to see how they’ll navigate married life. It’ll be a place of comfort for them and they’ll enjoy it."</p>

<p>And then there’s Eloise traveling to Scotland alongside her sister Francesca and new husband Lord John Stirling. She decided to pursue her curiosity and take a break from the marriage mart in doing so, so it’ll be interesting to see how she spends her time there.</p><p>It was as much of a cliffhanger ending for the new Stirlings as well, as Francesca met John’s cousin Michaela Stirling. In Quinn's book 'When He Was Wicked', this character is male and goes by the name Michael Stirling, so the role has been gender-swapped for Netflix's adaptation. Michaela’s appearance sent fans wild, and for those who’ve yet to read the book, the significance will become all the more clear as the seasons continue.</p><p>Finally, amongst all the love and marriage, Queen Charlotte made a statement in the season 3 finale of accepting Lady Whistledown, aka Penelope Featherington. Whether the Queen’s favor continues, only time will tell. Though Queen Charlotte actress Golda Rosheuvel did reveal during the <em>Bridgerton</em> Virtual Fan Event that season 4 will also "introduce some of the people who keep the ton's many households up and running." With Brownell speaking about "touchstones from the romance genre - including <em>Cinderella</em> - that resonated in this most recent season."</p>

<p>Netflix hasn't announced if a fifth season will be made. But, according to executive producer Shonda Rhimes, there’s hopefully going to be at least eight. Per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/shonda-rhimes-bridgerton-season-3-delays-penelope-colin-1235991808/" target="_blank">Variety</a>, Rhimes said she still plans to adapt all eight of the <em>Bridgerton</em> books, adding: "I do have a very specific plan of where we go each season – which one is which. Because you really have to start seeding in the other siblings, and what’s going on with them, to push them to the next season. We’ve really talked about it through, I think, season 6 or maybe 7."</p><p>It's unclear if Netflix will take a similar approach to <em>Bridgerton</em> seasons 3 and 4 and renew two more seasons at the same time. Considering how popular <em>Bridgerton</em> continues to be, however, we'd be surprised if it doesn't greenlight the pair, if not a trio of new seasons, before too long.</p><p>As for <em>Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story</em>, Rhimes has teased the possibility of making a second season. "We talk about it a lot," she told Variety. "And, for a while, I was holding it very close, and didn’t necessarily know that I wanted to play it out in a <em>Bridgerton</em> season. But, now we’ve been talking about what it would look like if we saw a little bit in <em>Bridgerton’s </em>present day, with Brimsley and Reynolds, and what that would mean [and] I think it deprives us of a chance to tell the story the way it should be told."</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/euphoria"><em>Euphoria</em></a> season 3 is officially in production. The return of one of the best shows on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/hbo-max-price-free-trial-movies-the-snyder-cut-and-more-explained">Max</a> in the US (it's on Sky Atlantic/Now in the UK, and Foxtel/Binge in Australia) has been greatly anticipated since its renewal in February 2022, with the hit show suffering numerous delays, setbacks and even rumors of it not returning at all, but let us be clear - <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max/good-news-euphoria-officially-isnt-canceled-but-dont-expect-season-3-to-arrive-on-max-any-time-soon"><em>Euphoria</em> is definitely not cancelled</a>.</p><p>And there's even better news. The cast and crew are back filming and it's looking like a 2026 release window. Sighs of relief all round for fans of the show, which coveted the title of being one of the most tweeted about shows in the last decade (per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/euphoria-most-tweeted-tv-show-1235190599/" target="_blank">Variety</a>). And no doubt season 3 will give us <em>plenty</em> to talk about and we're sure Max, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-tv-streaming-service-cord-cutting-compare">one of the best streaming services</a>, will be happy to provide.</p><p>So, when will <em>Euphoria</em>, aka one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-hbo-max-shows">best Max shows</a>, return for its third season? There's plenty for us to share with you from release date, plus confirmed cast including new and returning characters, story speculation, and more. For this, you'll have to read on. <strong>Full spoilers for </strong><em><strong>Euphoria</strong></em><strong>'s first two seasons </strong>are also discussed.</p>

<p>Whilst no release date has been set for <em>Euphoria</em> season 3 yet, it has been revealed by Max that the show is officially in production. And, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/white-lotus-season-3-premiere-february-euphoria-2026-1236234105/" target="_blank">Variety</a>, Warner Bros. Discovery exec JB Perrette revealed during a tech and media conference that there is an anticipated debut for <em>Euphoria </em>season 3 - and it's 2026.</p><p>Considering <em>Euphoria</em> season 3 has been hit with numerous delays, the lack of an <em>official</em> launch date isn't surprising. The Covid-19 pandemic, packed schedules of its rising stars, last year's Hollywood strikes, and the shock passing of Angus Cloud, known for his role of Fez, have all impacted its development. Heck, there was even a rumor that it would be canceled (per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2024/3/24/euphoria-season-3-cancelled" target="_blank">World of Reel</a>) earlier this year.</p><p>Zendaya, who plays protagonist Rue, has previously expressed her keenness to get back on set during an interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vogue.com.au/culture/welcome-to-the-year-of-zendaya/news-story/b08d6834409f6d69f958e79459f7fe76" target="_blank">Vogue Australia</a>. “I’m a firm believer that the right thing will happen at the right time," she said. "Things are meant to be the way they’re meant to be. I can’t speed things up, slow things down. I haven’t been working, honey. That’s been really tough for me because I’m so used to it. That’s all I know how to do, and it’s all I’ve ever done." And it seems her wishes have been answered.</p>

<p><strong>Possible spoilers follow for</strong><em><strong> Euphoria</strong></em><strong> seasons 1 and 2.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Here’s the confirmed cast, new and returning, so far for <em>Euphoria</em> season 3:</p>
<ul><li>Zendaya as Rue Bennett</li><li>Hunter Schafer as Jules Vaughn</li><li>Jacob Elordi as Nate Jacobs</li><li>Sydney Sweeney as Cassie Howard</li><li>Dominic Fike as Elliot</li><li>Maude Apatow as Lexi Howard</li><li>Alexa Demie as Maddy Perez</li><li>Eric Dane as Cal Jacobs</li><li>Colman Domingo as Ali</li><li>Martha Kelly as Laurie</li><li>Chloe Cherry as Faye</li><li>Sharon Stone as TBC</li><li>Rosalía as TBC</li><li>Marshawn Lynch as TBC</li><li>Kadeem Hardison as TBC</li><li>Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as TBC</li><li>Toby Wallace as TBC</li><li>Darrell Britt-Gibson as TBC</li><li>Priscilla Delgado as TBC</li><li>James Landry Hébert as TBC</li><li>Anna Van Patten as TBC</li></ul>
<p>While it's now been confirmed that most of the main cast will reprise their roles, the first actor whose involvement was official was Zendaya when HBO executive and <em>Euphoria</em> producer Casey Bloys spoke to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tvline.com/casting-news/zendaya-leaving-euphoria-season-3-speculation-hbo-1234789468/" target="_blank">TVLine</a> about the possibility of a <em>Euphoria</em> without her, saying "she’s going to be in season 3".</p><p>Bloys did concede that HBO <em>had </em>considered the possibility of Zendaya departing the series, but he stopped short of saying it would mean the end of <em>Euphoria</em>. "It’s hard to imagine doing the show without her," he admitted. "But, again, that would be something for her and Sam [Levinson] to discuss."</p><p>And as <em>Euphoria</em> season 3 is now in production, the return of Sydney Sweeney, Jacob Elordi, Hunter Schafer, Eric Dane, Alexa Demie and Maude Apatow as series regulars have all been revealed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/euphoria-season-3-cast-1236289227/" target="_blank">Deadline</a>. As well as Colman Domingo as a returning guest star. While Dominic Fike wasn't on the list of new and returning cast members released by HBO in February, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/dominic-fike-euphoria-season-3-return-1236308292/" target="_blank">Variety</a> also said in an exclusive report that he would, in fact, be returning. Though HBO has declined to comment.</p><p>One cast member who sadly won't return is Angus Cloud, who played Fezco 'Fez O’Neill. As the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-66889235#:~:text=Euphoria%20actor%20Angus%20Cloud%20died,US%20media%20outlets%20on%20Thursday." target="_blank">BBC</a> reported last July, he died following an accidental drug overdose, aged 25. Following Cloud's passing, it's likely that HBO will honor his performance by retiring the character altogether. Indeed, we'd be very surprised if they make the surreal and slightly uncomfortable decision to recast the role.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Barbie Ferreira, who played Kat Hernandez in the first two seasons<em>,</em> is won't be back. Speaking with Dax Sherpard on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/barbie-ferreira" target="_blank">Armchair Expert</a> podcast, Barbie said her departure from the show was "mutual", despite rumors of drama on set between her and Sam Levinson. "I would have played her for as long as I was asked to, depending on what the material was," she said. "It obviously hurts because I love Kat and she was so important to me and a lot of people." Sources also told Deadline that Algee Smith, Storm Reid, Austin Abrams and Nika King will all not be reprising their roles either for season 3.</p><p>Amidst all the main cast announcements, there have also been some exciting <em>new</em> cast members unveiled. In February, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/euphoria-sharon-stone-season-3-1236322880/" target="_blank">Variety</a> reported that Sharon Stone has been cast for <em>Euphoria </em>season 3. While her role is yet to be revealed, she said: "From the genius of Sam Levinson to the raw sophistication of this profoundly moving cast and tight crew. I am honored to be Euphoric."</p><p>Alongside this, Deadline revealed that Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (<em>Suicide Squad</em>) and Toby Wallace (<em>Babyteeth</em>) will be joining as series regulars. As well as Rosalía, Marshawn Lynch, Kadeem Hardison, Darrell Britt-Gibson, Priscilla Delgado, James Landy Hébert and Anna Van Patten who have all been cast in notable guest star roles. To which Lynch celebrated: "I'm hella juiced about the show and getting a chance to work with the people in front and behind the camera. At the end of the day, I'm just thankful for the opportunity."</p>

<p><strong>Major spoilers for </strong><em><strong>Euphoria </strong></em><strong>seasons 1 and 2 follow.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Let's recap <em>Euphoria</em>'s basic premise before speculating on season 3's plot. Based on the Israeli series of the same name, Levinson's series follows a group of high school students as they (attempt to) navigate friendships, relationships, trauma, and addiction in suburban Los Angeles.</p><p>Largely, events follow Zendaya’s Rue, a recovering drug addict who struggles to readjust to her life and friendships after returning from rehab. We’re slowly introduced to her circle of friends and the intertwining of their lives, which is constantly played out in a state of high drama. Along the way, we meet Maude Apatow's Lexi Howard, Rue's childhood best friend, and budding playwright 'Fez' (Cloud), a strangely kind-hearted drug dealer who has a complex relationship with Rue. Hunter Schafer's Jules Vaughn, a transgender girl who enters an up and down relationship with Rue after moving into their high school, is introduced early on, too.</p><p>With the show hit by various delays, there's been speculation about how the years between seasons will be addressed in the show. Speaking on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXTrzXftRcM&ab_channel=TheTonightShowStarringJimmyFallon" target="_blank">The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</a> in January, Jacob Elordi jokingly addressed rumors that the gap between seasons would need to be mirrored with a jump forward in <em>Euphoria</em>’s timeline. "I hope it’s soon," he said, "Or they’re going to have to Benjamin Button me or something. I’m going to have a bad back walking down the hallway, you know?"</p><p>While it's not clear how far in time season 3 will leap, it has been confirmed that it most definitely will. Max exec Casey Bloys confirmed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/max-euphoria-season-3-time-jump-crazy-rich-asians-olympics-casey-bloys-jb-perrette-1236030558/" target="_blank">Variety</a> in June 2024 that Sam Levinson will be jumping forward in time: "One of the issues I think that Sam is thinking about is that he doesn't want to have it in high school anymore. That's where it was set and what made sense then. So when you take it out of that, there's a lot of back and forth about where to set it and how far in the future to set it and all that stuff. But I think he's got a take that he's excited about, and he's busy writing."</p><p>Irrespective of whether <em>Euphoria</em> season 3 picks up immediately after the events of season 2's finale, or sometime afterwards, the most pressing issue to resolve concerns the ongoing love triangle between Jacob Elordi's Nate, Sydney Sweeney's Cassie, and Alexa Demie's Maddy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wJKkBcJmrfhNZj4rVxDeJ6" name="Screen Shot 2022-01-30 at 9.32.43 PM.png" alt="Sydney Sweeney's Cassie stares into the distance in Euphoria season 2 episode 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wJKkBcJmrfhNZj4rVxDeJ6.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Cassie's intense relationship with Nate needs some form of resolution in season 3 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HBO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After Rue angrily revealed that Nate and Cassie had been seeing each other behind Maddy's back, it seemed like their relationship was doomed. However, after a tension-filled late night visit where Nate finally ended his on-again/off-again relationship with Maddy, he invited Cassie to live with him for a while, suggesting the pair would become an item.</p><p>But, after the events of Lexi's play – where she decided to air everyone's dirty laundry live on-stage – Nate stormed out and ended things with Cassie, who stormed the stage herself, taking shots at her sisters and her friends. While Cassie and Maddy didn't end the season on such angry terms, you'd imagine this storyline is going to run and run in <em>Euphoria</em> season 3.</p><p>Indeed, Cassie is likely to continue to bear the brunt of the turmoil following the aftermath of her break-up with Nate during the messy conclusion of Lexi’s play in episode 7 of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/how-to-watch-euphoria-season-2-online-where-you-are"><em>Euphoria</em> season 2.</a> Despite this, Sydney Sweeney says she’s “excited” to step back into her character. In an interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://people.com/sydney-sweeney-excited-jump-back-into-playing-cassie-euphoria-exclusive-8700823?taid=66d5dc55125b4400012a4776&utm_campaign=peoplemagazine&utm_content=new&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com" target="_blank">People Magazine</a> on September 2, Sweeney stated that she’s “very excited to jump back into Cassie”, adding that “she (Cassie) is definitely one of the most special characters for me and I love my <em>Euphoria</em> family, so I look forward to it”.</p><p>The outcomes for Cassie’s character development in season 3 could go either way, however it’s the rampant and destructive side of her character that Sweeney appears to be the most thrilled about stepping back into, disclosing “I love crazy Cassie, so the crazier, the better for me”. Therefore, it poses the question as to whether Cassie will have matured over the course of the time jump that’s set to take place. While Sweeney did not disclose any further information about season 3’s plot, her statements about wanting to step back into Cassie’s darker side could open the door to the possibility of her self-destructive tendencies making a comeback in the next installment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="y5duorc7yktee9JLubKkNZ" name="16418391717839_ccexpress.jpeg" alt="Zendaya in Euphoria season 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y5duorc7yktee9JLubKkNZ.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1320" height="742" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">What will happen between Jules and Rue? </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HBO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Elsewhere, Nate is dealing with the sexual promiscuity of his father, Cal (Eric Dane). At the beginning of season 1, we saw Nate discovering his father's collection of homemade videos featuring him having sex with young gay men. Subsequently, he discovered his father's most recent video, which features Schafer's Jules, who he knows to be underage.</p><p>Eventually, after a lot of back and forth, Cal came out to his family and left them to start a new life. But Nate, who has always been angry about his father's behavior and the impact it has had on their family, wasn't prepared to let sleeping dogs lie. Knowing former girlfriend Maddy had a copy of his father's tape with Jules, he tracked it down and took it back, eventually returning it to Jules.</p><p>At the end of season 2, we saw Nate confront his father with a gun and a flash drive containing all of Cal’s explicit activity. After revealing his trauma from viewing the videos at a young age, we learned that he has decided to turn Cal in and the police come to arrest him. The end of the matter? Not by a long shot. This saga and its effect on Nate's family will likely be a key part of the Euphoria season 3 narrative.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:619px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="QwGsSzUf4EGyYrh9uxnmBA" name="euphoria-recap-season-2-episode-2-dw-2.jpg" alt="Eric Dane's Cal Jacobs looks forlorn in Euphoria season 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QwGsSzUf4EGyYrh9uxnmBA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="619" height="348" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">What's next for Cal Jacobs following his arrest in the <em>Euphoria</em> season 2 finale? </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HBO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the small matter of Jules and Rue. After spending much of season 2 together, Jules discovered that Rue had relapsed and told her family, leaving Rue to cut ties during a bitter intervention. As Rue recovered, she and Jules remained on icy terms, but, during the finale, Jules sat next to Rue in the audience for Lexi's play, telling her that she loves and misses her. Rue kissed her on the forehead before walking away, leaving us with some hope for the future. Can the two reconcile? And what will become of Dominic Fike's Elliot, Rue's former drug partner and Jules' sometime lover?</p><p>Finally, season 2's curtain came down in a bullet-laden stand-off that ended with Cloud's Fez being shot in the stomach and arrested for two murders. Ash, his long-time business partner, was shot dead in the drama by police, leaving Fez truly alone. Following Angus Cloud's passing, Fez will not return for <em>Euphoria</em> season 3, so the story may need to play out differently.</p><p>In short, then, there's plenty of narrative ground for <em>Euphoria</em> season 3 to cover. While we wait for more news, we think there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/features/three-big-questions-that-need-answering-in-euphoria-season-3">three big questions that <em>Euphoria</em> season 3 needs to answer</a> before it's released. See if you agree with our thoughts on what needs addressing.</p>

<p>A trailer for <em>Euphoria</em> season 3 has not been released. That's not surprising, given the show doesn't have a return date, only a 2026 window. We'll add a trailer in here once once is released.</p>

<p>As is the nature of a show like <em>Euphoria</em> – which is built around a group of high-schoolers and their adolescent antics – things can’t go on forever (certainly not with the same cast, anyway).</p><p>Speaking about the show's age-related restrictions to TVLine, HBO boss Casey Bloys admitted it has a very definite shelf-life: "Well, [the characters] are in high school, so there are only so many seasons it can go. There’s a time limit". Bloys was quick to point out, though, that he's happy for Levinson to figure out the show’s natural end, adding: "We’ll follow [Sam’s] lead on that. There is no set plan. But I don’t think you want 30-year-olds playing [high school students]."</p><p>Those quotes date back to HBO green-lighting the show’s second season in July 2019, when <em>Euphoria</em> wasn’t quite the TV juggernaut it is now. However, interviewed recently, again by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tvline.com/2022/02/16/zendaya-leaving-euphoria-season-3-speculation-hbo/" target="_blank">TVLine</a>, Bloys stuck to his word when asked about the show’s planned third season, saying: "I will let Sam and Zendaya talk about that. I’m very excited about what they’ve got planned [for season 3]. So I will leave that to them. I will say, generally speaking, we trust where they want to take these characters. So we’ll let the creative team lead the way."</p><p>Everyone, HBO included, seems to accept that the show can’t run for seven or eight seasons – but, with no end date in sight (until we hear otherwise), we'd anticipate at least one more season of <em>Euphoria</em> before it ends for good.</p>

<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">#Euphoria Season 3 is in production. pic.twitter.com/Lm6Q5IH14c<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1888981765626155166">February 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Whilst no release date has been set for <em>Euphoria</em> season 3 yet, it has been revealed by Max that the show is officially in production. And, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/white-lotus-season-3-premiere-february-euphoria-2026-1236234105/" target="_blank">Variety</a>, Warner Bros. Discovery exec JB Perrette revealed during a tech and media conference that there is an anticipated debut for <em>Euphoria </em>season 3 - and it's 2026.</p><p>Considering <em>Euphoria</em> season 3 has been hit with numerous delays, the lack of an <em>official</em> launch date isn't surprising. The Covid-19 pandemic, packed schedules of its rising stars, last year's Hollywood strikes, and the shock passing of Angus Cloud, known for his role of Fez, have all impacted its development. Heck, there was even a rumor that it would be canceled (per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2024/3/24/euphoria-season-3-cancelled" target="_blank">World of Reel</a>) earlier this year.</p><p>Zendaya, who plays protagonist Rue, has previously expressed her keenness to get back on set during an interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vogue.com.au/culture/welcome-to-the-year-of-zendaya/news-story/b08d6834409f6d69f958e79459f7fe76" target="_blank">Vogue Australia</a>. “I’m a firm believer that the right thing will happen at the right time," she said. "Things are meant to be the way they’re meant to be. I can’t speed things up, slow things down. I haven’t been working, honey. That’s been really tough for me because I’m so used to it.

<p><strong>Possible spoilers follow for</strong><em><strong> Euphoria</strong></em><strong> seasons 1 and 2.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Here’s the confirmed cast, new and returning, so far for <em>Euphoria</em> season 3:</p>
<ul><li>Zendaya as Rue Bennett</li><li>Hunter Schafer as Jules Vaughn</li><li>Jacob Elordi as Nate Jacobs</li><li>Sydney Sweeney as Cassie Howard</li><li>Dominic Fike as Elliot</li><li>Maude Apatow as Lexi Howard</li><li>Alexa Demie as Maddy Perez</li><li>Eric Dane as Cal Jacobs</li><li>Colman Domingo as Ali</li><li>Martha Kelly as Laurie</li><li>Chloe Cherry as Faye</li><li>Sharon Stone as TBC</li><li>Rosalía as TBC</li><li>Marshawn Lynch as TBC</li><li>Kadeem Hardison as TBC</li><li>Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as TBC</li><li>Toby Wallace as TBC</li><li>Darrell Britt-Gibson as TBC</li><li>Priscilla Delgado as TBC</li><li>James Landry Hébert as TBC</li><li>Anna Van Patten as TBC</li></ul>
<p>While it's now been confirmed that most of the main cast will reprise their roles, the first actor whose involvement was official was Zendaya when HBO executive and <em>Euphoria</em> producer Casey Bloys spoke to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tvline.com/casting-news/zendaya-leaving-euphoria-season-3-speculation-hbo-1234789468/" target="_blank">TVLine</a> about the possibility of a <em>Euphoria</em> without her, saying "she’s going to be in season 3".</p><p>Bloys did concede that HBO <em>had </em>considered the possibility of Zendaya departing the series, but he stopped short of saying it would mean the end of <em>Euphoria</em>. "It’s hard to imagine doing the show without her," he admitted. "But, again, that would be something for her and Sam [Levinson] to discuss."</p><p>And as <em>Euphoria</em> season 3 is now in production, the return of Sydney Sweeney, Jacob Elordi, Hunter Schafer, Eric Dane, Alexa Demie and Maude Apatow as series regulars have all been revealed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/euphoria-season-3-cast-1236289227/" target="_blank">Deadline</a>. As well as Colman Domingo as a returning guest star. While Dominic Fike wasn't on the list of new and returning cast members released by HBO in February, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/dominic-fike-euphoria-season-3-return-1236308292/" target="_blank">Variety</a> also said in an exclusive report that he would, in fact, be returning. Though HBO has declined to comment.</p><p>One cast member who sadly won't return is Angus Cloud, who played Fezco 'Fez O’Neill. As the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-66889235#:~:text=Euphoria%20actor%20Angus%20Cloud%20died,US%20media%20outlets%20on%20Thursday." target="_blank">BBC</a> reported last July, he died following an accidental drug overdose, aged 25. Following Cloud's passing, it's likely that HBO will honor his performance by retiring the character altogether. Indeed, we'd be very surprised if they make the surreal and slightly uncomfortable decision to recast the role.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Barbie Ferreira, who played Kat Hernandez in the first two seasons<em>,</em> is won't be back. Speaking with Dax Sherpard on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/barbie-ferreira" target="_blank">Armchair Expert</a> podcast, Barbie said her departure from the show was "mutual", despite rumors of drama on set between her and Sam Levinson. "I would have played her for as long as I was asked to, depending on what the material was," she said. "It obviously hurts because I love Kat and she was so important to me and a lot of people." Sources also told Deadline that Algee Smith, Storm Reid, Austin Abrams and Nika King will all not be reprising their roles either for season 3.</p><p>Amidst all the main cast announcements, there have also been some exciting <em>new</em> cast members unveiled. In February, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/euphoria-sharon-stone-season-3-1236322880/" target="_blank">Variety</a> reported that Sharon Stone has been cast for <em>Euphoria </em>season 3. While her role is yet to be revealed, she said: "From the genius of Sam Levinson to the raw sophistication of this profoundly moving cast and tight crew. I am honored to be Euphoric."</p><p>Alongside this, Deadline revealed that Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (<em>Suicide Squad</em>) and Toby Wallace (<em>Babyteeth</em>) will be joining as series regulars. As well as Rosalía, Marshawn Lynch, Kadeem Hardison, Darrell Britt-Gibson, Priscilla Delgado, James Landy Hébert and Anna Van Patten who have all been cast in notable guest star roles. To which Lynch celebrated: "I'm hella juiced about the show and getting a chance to work with the people in front and behind the camera. At the end of the day, I'm just thankful for the opportunity."</p>

<p><strong>Major spoilers for </strong><em><strong>Euphoria </strong></em><strong>seasons 1 and 2 follow.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Let's recap <em>Euphoria</em>'s basic premise before speculating on season 3's plot. Based on the Israeli series of the same name, Levinson's series follows a group of high school students as they (attempt to) navigate friendships, relationships, trauma, and addiction in suburban Los Angeles.</p><p>Largely, events follow Zendaya’s Rue, a recovering drug addict who struggles to readjust to her life and friendships after returning from rehab. We’re slowly introduced to her circle of friends and the intertwining of their lives, which is constantly played out in a state of high drama. Along the way, we meet Maude Apatow's Lexi Howard, Rue's childhood best friend, and budding playwright 'Fez' (Cloud), a strangely kind-hearted drug dealer who has a complex relationship with Rue. Hunter Schafer's Jules Vaughn, a transgender girl who enters an up and down relationship with Rue after moving into their high school, is introduced early on, too.</p><p>With the show hit by various delays, there's been speculation about how the years between seasons will be addressed in the show. Speaking on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXTrzXftRcM&ab_channel=TheTonightShowStarringJimmyFallon" target="_blank">The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</a> in January, Jacob Elordi jokingly addressed rumors that the gap between seasons would need to be mirrored with a jump forward in <em>Euphoria</em>’s timeline. "I hope it’s soon," he said, "Or they’re going to have to Benjamin Button me or something. I’m going to have a bad back walking down the hallway, you know?"</p><p>While it's not clear how far in time season 3 will leap, it has been confirmed that it most definitely will. Max exec Casey Bloys confirmed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/max-euphoria-season-3-time-jump-crazy-rich-asians-olympics-casey-bloys-jb-perrette-1236030558/" target="_blank">Variety</a> in June 2024 that Sam Levinson will be jumping forward in time: "One of the issues I think that Sam is thinking about is that he doesn't want to have it in high school anymore. That's where it was set and what made sense then. So when you take it out of that, there's a lot of back and forth about where to set it and how far in the future to set it and all that stuff. But I think he's got a take that he's excited about, and he's busy writing."</p><p>Irrespective of whether <em>Euphoria</em> season 3 picks up immediately after the events of season 2's finale, or sometime afterwards, the most pressing issue to resolve concerns the ongoing love triangle between Jacob Elordi's Nate, Sydney Sweeney's Cassie, and Alexa Demie's Maddy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wJKkBcJmrfhNZj4rVxDeJ6" name="Screen Shot 2022-01-30 at 9.32.43 PM.png" alt="Sydney Sweeney's Cassie stares into the distance in Euphoria season 2 episode 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wJKkBcJmrfhNZj4rVxDeJ6.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Cassie's intense relationship with Nate needs some form of resolution in season 3 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HBO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After Rue angrily revealed that Nate and Cassie had been seeing each other behind Maddy's back, it seemed like their relationship was doomed. However, after a tension-filled late night visit where Nate finally ended his on-again/off-again relationship with Maddy, he invited Cassie to live with him for a while, suggesting the pair would become an item.</p><p>But, after the events of Lexi's play – where she decided to air everyone's dirty laundry live on-stage – Nate stormed out and ended things with Cassie, who stormed the stage herself, taking shots at her sisters and her friends. While Cassie and Maddy didn't end the season on such angry terms, you'd imagine this storyline is going to run and run in <em>Euphoria</em> season 3.</p><p>Indeed, Cassie is likely to continue to bear the brunt of the turmoil following the aftermath of her break-up with Nate during the messy conclusion of Lexi’s play in episode 7 of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/how-to-watch-euphoria-season-2-online-where-you-are"><em>Euphoria</em> season 2.</a> Despite this, Sydney Sweeney says she’s “excited” to step back into her character. In an interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://people.com/sydney-sweeney-excited-jump-back-into-playing-cassie-euphoria-exclusive-8700823?taid=66d5dc55125b4400012a4776&utm_campaign=peoplemagazine&utm_content=new&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com" target="_blank">People Magazine</a> on September 2, Sweeney stated that she’s “very excited to jump back into Cassie”, adding that “she (Cassie) is definitely one of the most special characters for me and I love my <em>Euphoria</em> family, so I look forward to it”.</p><p>The outcomes for Cassie’s character development in season 3 could go either way, however it’s the rampant and destructive side of her character that Sweeney appears to be the most thrilled about stepping back into, disclosing “I love crazy Cassie, so the crazier, the better for me”. Therefore, it poses the question as to whether Cassie will have matured over the course of the time jump that’s set to take place. While Sweeney did not disclose any further information about season 3’s plot, her statements about wanting to step back into Cassie’s darker side could open the door to the possibility of her self-destructive tendencies making a comeback in the next installment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="y5duorc7yktee9JLubKkNZ" name="16418391717839_ccexpress.jpeg" alt="Zendaya in Euphoria season 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y5duorc7yktee9JLubKkNZ.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1320" height="742" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">What will happen between Jules and Rue? </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HBO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Elsewhere, Nate is dealing with the sexual promiscuity of his father, Cal (Eric Dane). At the beginning of season 1, we saw Nate discovering his father's collection of homemade videos featuring him having sex with young gay men. Subsequently, he discovered his father's most recent video, which features Schafer's Jules, who he knows to be underage.</p><p>Eventually, after a lot of back and forth, Cal came out to his family and left them to start a new life. But Nate, who has always been angry about his father's behavior and the impact it has had on their family, wasn't prepared to let sleeping dogs lie. Knowing former girlfriend Maddy had a copy of his father's tape with Jules, he tracked it down and took it back, eventually returning it to Jules.</p><p>At the end of season 2, we saw Nate confront his father with a gun and a flash drive containing all of Cal’s explicit activity. After revealing his trauma from viewing the videos at a young age, we learned that he has decided to turn Cal in and the police come to arrest him. The end of the matter? Not by a long shot. This saga and its effect on Nate's family will likely be a key part of the Euphoria season 3 narrative.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:619px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="QwGsSzUf4EGyYrh9uxnmBA" name="euphoria-recap-season-2-episode-2-dw-2.jpg" alt="Eric Dane's Cal Jacobs looks forlorn in Euphoria season 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QwGsSzUf4EGyYrh9uxnmBA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="619" height="348" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">What's next for Cal Jacobs following his arrest in the <em>Euphoria</em> season 2 finale? </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HBO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the small matter of Jules and Rue. After spending much of season 2 together, Jules discovered that Rue had relapsed and told her family, leaving Rue to cut ties during a bitter intervention. As Rue recovered, she and Jules remained on icy terms, but, during the finale, Jules sat next to Rue in the audience for Lexi's play, telling her that she loves and misses her. Rue kissed her on the forehead before walking away, leaving us with some hope for the future. Can the two reconcile? And what will become of Dominic Fike's Elliot, Rue's former drug partner and Jules' sometime lover?</p><p>Finally, season 2's curtain came down in a bullet-laden stand-off that ended with Cloud's Fez being shot in the stomach and arrested for two murders. Ash, his long-time business partner, was shot dead in the drama by police, leaving Fez truly alone. Following Angus Cloud's passing, Fez will not return for <em>Euphoria</em> season 3, so the story may need to play out differently.</p><p>In short, then, there's plenty of narrative ground for <em>Euphoria</em> season 3 to cover. While we wait for more news, we think there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/features/three-big-questions-that-need-answering-in-euphoria-season-3">three big questions that <em>Euphoria</em> season 3 needs to answer</a> before it's released. See if you agree with our thoughts on what needs addressing.</p>

<p>A trailer for <em>Euphoria</em> season 3 has not been released. That's not surprising, given the show doesn't have a return date, only a 2026 window. We'll add a trailer in here once once is released.</p>

<p>As is the nature of a show like <em>Euphoria</em> – which is built around a group of high-schoolers and their adolescent antics – things can’t go on forever (certainly not with the same cast, anyway).</p><p>Speaking about the show's age-related restrictions to TVLine, HBO boss Casey Bloys admitted it has a very definite shelf-life: "Well, [the characters] are in high school, so there are only so many seasons it can go. There’s a time limit". Bloys was quick to point out, though, that he's happy for Levinson to figure out the show’s natural end, adding: "We’ll follow [Sam’s] lead on that. There is no set plan. But I don’t think you want 30-year-olds playing [high school students]."</p><p>Those quotes date back to HBO green-lighting the show’s second season in July 2019, when <em>Euphoria</em> wasn’t quite the TV juggernaut it is now. However, interviewed recently, again by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tvline.com/2022/02/16/zendaya-leaving-euphoria-season-3-speculation-hbo/" target="_blank">TVLine</a>, Bloys stuck to his word when asked about the show’s planned third season, saying: "I will let Sam and Zendaya talk about that. I’m very excited about what they’ve got planned [for season 3]. So I will leave that to them. I will say, generally speaking, we trust where they want to take these characters. So we’ll let the creative team lead the way."</p><p>Everyone, HBO included, seems to accept that the show can’t run for seven or eight seasons – but, with no end date in sight (until we hear otherwise), we'd anticipate at least one more season of <em>Euphoria</em> before it ends for good.</p>

<hr>
<p>Like many of Nvidia’s highest spending customers, Meta is looking to slash its reliance on the GPU maker’s expensive AI hardware by making its own silicon.</p><p>In 2024, the social media giant began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/meta-looking-to-use-exotic-custom-cpu-in-its-datacenters-for-machine-learning-and-ai-yet-another-indication-that-nvidias-most-formidable-rivals-are-developing-their-own-alternatives-to-its-hardware">advertising for engineers</a> to help build its own state-of-the-art machine learning accelerators, and now, according to an exclusive report from <em>Reuters</em>, Meta is at the testing stage for its first in-house chip designed for training AI systems.</p><p>Sources told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/meta-begins-testing-its-first-in-house-ai-training-chip-2025-03-11/"><em>Reuters</em></a> that following its first tape-out of the chip, Meta has started a limited deployment, and if testing goes well, it plans to scale production for wider use.</p>
<h2 id="risc-v-business-2">RISC-V business</h2>
<p>According to Reuters, “Meta's new training chip is a dedicated accelerator, meaning it is designed to handle only AI-specific tasks. This can make it more power-efficient than the integrated graphics processing units (GPUs) generally used for AI workloads.”</p><p>Taiwan-based chipmaker TSMC produced the silicon for Meta as part of the Facebook owner’s Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) program, something which <em>Reuters</em> points out has had “a wobbly start for years and at one point scrapped a chip at a similar phase of development.”</p><p>In 2023, Meta unveiled its first-generation in-house AI inference accelerator designed to power the ranking and recommendation systems for Facebook and Instagram, and then in April 2024 it debuted a new version that doubled the compute and memory bandwidth.</p><p>At the 2024 Hot Chips symposium, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/meta-showcases-the-hardware-that-will-power-recommendations-for-facebook-and-instagram-low-cost-risc-v-cores-and-mainstream-lpddr5-memory-are-at-the-heart-of-its-mtia-recommendation-inference-cpu">Meta revealed that its inference chip was built on TSMC's 5nm process</a>, with the processing elements on RISC-V cores.</p><p>Like a growing number of tech firms, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/meta-has-done-something-that-will-get-nvidia-and-amd-very-very-worried-it-gave-up-on-gpu-and-cpu-to-take-a-risc-y-route-for-ai-training-and-inference-acceleration">Facebook has thrown its weight behind RISC-V</a> in order to recognize its AI ambitions, and although the <em>Reuters</em> report doesn’t provide any details on the technical aspects of Meta’s new AI training chip, it seems a fair bet that it too will be based on the open source RISC-V architecture.</p><p>The <em>Reuters</em> article does note that Meta executives say they want to start using their own chips for training by next year.</p>

<hr>
<p>Like many of Nvidia’s highest spending customers, Meta is looking to slash its reliance on the GPU maker’s expensive AI hardware by making its own silicon.</p><p>In 2024, the social media giant began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/meta-looking-to-use-exotic-custom-cpu-in-its-datacenters-for-machine-learning-and-ai-yet-another-indication-that-nvidias-most-formidable-rivals-are-developing-their-own-alternatives-to-its-hardware">advertising for engineers</a> to help build its own state-of-the-art machine learning accelerators, and now, according to an exclusive report from <em>Reuters</em>, Meta is at the testing stage for its first in-house chip designed for training AI systems.</p><p>Sources told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/meta-begins-testing-its-first-in-house-ai-training-chip-2025-03-11/"><em>Reuters</em></a> that following its first tape-out of the chip, Meta has started a limited deployment, and if testing goes well, it plans to scale production for wider use.</p>
<h2 id="risc-v-business-6">RISC-V business</h2>
<p>According to Reuters, “Meta's new training chip is a dedicated accelerator, meaning it is designed to handle only AI-specific tasks. This can make it more power-efficient than the integrated graphics processing units (GPUs) generally used for AI workloads.”</p><p>Taiwan-based chipmaker TSMC produced the silicon for Meta as part of the Facebook owner’s Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) program, something which <em>Reuters</em> points out has had “a wobbly start for years and at one point scrapped a chip at a similar phase of development.”</p><p>In 2023, Meta unveiled its first-generation in-house AI inference accelerator designed to power the ranking and recommendation systems for Facebook and Instagram, and then in April 2024 it debuted a new version that doubled the compute and memory bandwidth.</p><p>At the 2024 Hot Chips symposium, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/meta-showcases-the-hardware-that-will-power-recommendations-for-facebook-and-instagram-low-cost-risc-v-cores-and-mainstream-lpddr5-memory-are-at-the-heart-of-its-mtia-recommendation-inference-cpu">Meta revealed that its inference chip was built on TSMC's 5nm process</a>, with the processing elements on RISC-V cores.</p><p>Like a growing number of tech firms, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/meta-has-done-something-that-will-get-nvidia-and-amd-very-very-worried-it-gave-up-on-gpu-and-cpu-to-take-a-risc-y-route-for-ai-training-and-inference-acceleration">Facebook has thrown its weight behind RISC-V</a> in order to recognize its AI ambitions, and although the <em>Reuters</em> report doesn’t provide any details on the technical aspects of Meta’s new AI training chip, it seems a fair bet that it too will be based on the open source RISC-V architecture.</p><p>The <em>Reuters</em> article does note that Meta executives say they want to start using their own chips for training by next year.</p>
